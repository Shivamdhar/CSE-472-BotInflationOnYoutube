The parable of the 10 Virgins were for Israel during the Tribulation Period. Failure to understand this is failure to rightly divide scriptures.\n\nThe Church is not under the law:\nRomans 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.\nGalatians 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.\nJames 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.\nGalatians 3:10 For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, ‚ÄúCursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.‚Äù\nGalatians 2:16 Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.\nRomans 4:15 For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.\nRomans 3:20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.\nGalatians 3:24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith.\nGalatians 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for ‚ÄúThe righteous shall live by faith.‚Äù\nGalatians 2:21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.', 'JesusSaves RunningRaven': 'Love Tucker', 'XspeedXracerX': "Thank you, JD!
