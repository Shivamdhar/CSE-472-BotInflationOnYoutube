It was spread to other holidays such as "Thanksgiving" mentioned by name but Christmas was just "December 25th".\n\nIn 1962 the Supreme Court "outlawed prayer in school".  Not quite.

Children are impressionable and under the psychological power of authority until the moment of their 18th birthday when they become a "reasonable man" ( <--- legalese ). So:\n\n1) A teacher cannot lead a prayer.\n2) A student cannot lead a prayer at a school function because children have to sit and keep quiet and listen in school -- just like church.\n3) A student putting a Bible quote or such for their picture in the yearbook is OK. The ACLU went to court on that one.\n4) When a chaplain gives a prayer or sermonette in a legislature you will see legislators chatting quietly, getting up and leaving or coming back to sit down. Some of them have to disrespect the prayer or the meeting of the legislature would be a church service.\n5) Colleges are largely exempt.  They can\'t use government funds for the chapel, chaplain or theology courses and many are founded by churches such as Southern Methodist.
