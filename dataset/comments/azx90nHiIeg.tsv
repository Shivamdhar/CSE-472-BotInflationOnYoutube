Marilyn Pechuls	Once weapons were manufacturered for wars now wars are manufactured to make weapons. Excellent observation.
Michael Martin	Trumps style reminds me of Russell Hantz from survivor.
Kelso Sunshine	I just wish I heard Tulsi speak up about the effects of military intervention on civilians. I think her defense of US troops and the prioritization of domestic policy is admirable and appreciated. But there are so many other reasons why the US military industrial complex is harmful.
Dan Jones	Everyone knows, the world condemns it and we keep doing it.  We‚Äôre no different than Hitler.
heil hilt	Tyt with the corporation mida to there Jimmy brown buffalo got 25mill from dem man you need to split from them they are falling and loseing lots off respects  from the ppl because off the lies man
C L	We are all just munkies with math and weapons
Blueman Chicago	But wait,,,,I thought (we were told ) that the Saudis did 911???  What a load of BS!
Wynn Wagner	There are people waking up to the truth from both sides. Thank you.
Rael Sackey	They like to say our relationship with Saudi Arabia is "complicated". BS! American's interests are financial! Let's stop fooling ourselves, and it didn't start with Trump! Why did we overthrow democratically elected governments in the Middle East, Central and South America, and Africa. Because we wanted to make sure their resources remained in the hands of the oligarchs, via local puppets who oppress their own people, or be eliminated!
MACK D	I don't understand what Don is trying to say. First of all they DID steal the oil and they still are! He says that the US has spent $7trillion in the middle east but on what and why do the mid east countries that have been invaded, occupied, robbed of their resources and destroyed by the US have to pay? Pay for what? Did the US build hospitals and schools, bridges or roads or did the US give money to the millions upon millions of innocent, civilians that they have displaced, maimed, humiliated, raped and murdered for food and medicine and to help them re-build their homes that the US destroyed? What about all the innocent children that they've already murdered? I think they're called "collateral damage" ... "its a risk that the US is willing to take because liberating the people is why the US is there!" AHAHAHA HAHA! !! It has nothing to do with the sale of arms and the petro dollar! .... that's a good one!  ... someone should tell that to millions of dead civilians!!
John Allen	The US had been doining the neasty dde for years. Stop it now.
Justin Friedman	Jimmy you look super sick... get better! üôÅü§í
lookllx	CNN (Corporate News Network) never shock me.  Tulsi has been calling for a end to funding Saudi terrorist saga during the Obama administration but they never had her on then.
numbersix100	It‚Äôs worse than you think. Saudi Arabia are bribing the US to sit on their hands with a $100bn arms order. It looks like we‚Äôre preparing to attack Iran, the UK has moved heavy land forces to Omanüò≥üò≥ Supposedly for an ‚Äúexercise‚Äù. Main battle tanks etc etc etc.
Bryan Dov Bergman	Oh boohoo. My wife's family is from Yemen. My kids are half Yemenite. They kicked them all out of Yemen at the point of a sword in 1948 because they are Jewish. Yemen still has slavery, black slaves from Africa. Funny how you leftists alway cherry pick who to level your broadsides of priggishness at. If you're a brown Muslim, black slaves A Okay. What hypocrites. Everyone in Yemen carries a sword around they are such a peaceful pp and the rich one of endured rhino ivory on the handles. Boohoo. Yemen got bombed.
Alaric11	I'm a conservative but it is LONG overdue that we disentangle ourselves from that terrible saudi regime.
EVZYL	Follow the money.  Just follow the money.  It's SO simple and obvious.
Jules Elbeshausen	BRAVO, Jimmy...Take a Bow...
Empress Empress	Poor innocent women, children , animals , and civilians in general that live in Yemen.üò¢. Disgusting evil satanic govt we have in Washington DC!!üò°. How would you like Pompeo if your family is murdered and bombed into pieces?!!  Then America wonders why we‚Äôre hated by the world!
Tick Tock	In less than 8 years all these clowns will be swallowing fire in the lake that they're swimming in for eternity
Pat Hacker	Profit motive is very powerful.  Money talks.
Gurvinder Parmar	Trump is America's wake up call...instead of seeing the truth (because he's making it astoundingly easy) people are continuing to live in their delusions about what the government really represents.
doeme80	Thinking is to exhausting Jimmy. Let's keep it easy, and blame Trump.
M L	Jimmy Dore forgot to mention that "Sanders Introduces Bill to End Catastrophic US War in Yemen".  "Three years of U.S.-Saudi war has turned Yemen into the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. Senators Bernie Sanders and Mike Lee introduced a bipartisan bill to end the U.S. role in the war." Published on Feb 28, 2018 by TheRealNews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO5g4dbUp4Y
philbio66	Does this surprise anyone?  Even if they dropped bombs on our troops, we would still sell them weapons.
Judd Hurst	Let's put this into perspective our entire foreign policy is based off of weapon sales for corporations. Our entire country is going down the tubes for corporate profits. The government does nothing to represent the people of this country anymore they just plaster it across the truth like a veneer. will eating unhealthy unsafe foods that contain basically Zero nutritional value because corporate Farms want to save money people die on the streets without access to healthcare for corporate profits. companies cut jobs because quarterly numbers are too low even though they're still making billions of dollars they're not making more money than the previous quarter so they have to slash jobs so people are losing their entire livelihoods so that CEOs can keep their pee in there ridiculous Christmas bonuses. All of this going on as we the corporate slaves of the United corporations of America I mean we the people of the United States of America fight over tax policy that does not affect our lives at all. People talk about taxes are going to go up to pay for healthcare why how about we shrink that super bloated military budget in half and pay for every single thing we need to pay for in this country. I'm sure 350 billion dollars a year would go a lot farther rebuilding our infrastructure the bus creating jobs thus creating Revenue through taxes thus boosting the economy in Rural America as well as Urban America.I'm almost to the point of genocide I almost feel like the baby boomer generation need to be herded off of a cliff rounded up and put in the internment camps that they legalized in the National Defense authorization act that's what we should use it for sorry and shit if your parents are better than mine but these old motherfuckers these greedy pieces of shit that took the greatest country on Earth and handed it over literally handed over our country to the corporations for them to decide what's best for the American people. And now we the new generation are going to have to find a way to navigate through this horseshit or straight up revolt hit the reset button and start over and there goes another 15 years of rebuilding and restructuring while people suffer there's no easy way out of this there's not going to be a president with a swipe of a pin solve these problems this shit has to be rectified now and who knows what kind of horrendous it'll happen over that many years or if you can even keep the agenda study for that long. everybody talks about Revolution and like you're going to go against the US Military. That is just not so it's the police department's you'll be going against they're the ones that are willing to shoot civilians for corporate profits but they are also cowards some point it's got to happen that's what I'm getting at with this long ass rant at some point somebody's got to be willing to lay their goddamn life down to enact some change or we are fucking doomed. The fact that we have orange buffoon raising tariffs on materials that we do not produce at all in this country before starting infrastructure Banks to help get steel industry going again and text out Industrieshas caused the rest of the world to realize the United States is fucking insane and now they are building their own International banking system getting away from the US controlled Swift system which is how we enact the sanctions these other countries are going to move on without us Building Bridges working together we're literally pushing people who were allies what do United States we are pushing them closer to people who they were protecting us from allowing them to build Bridges with each other and mend the scars and become allies. And it barely makes the news. The fact that the Trump Administration did not know that countries like India have to have trade with Iran it's the only viable option so their energy source oil. there is no other option without shipping and paying ridiculous amounts of money it's not feasible for a country as oil-dependent as India is. It's almost like John Bolton and others in government no but have dreamed of this global war for Domination their entire adult lives and they don't care about the risk they're getting old and they want their dream to come true their dream of total American domination of the globe that's what these Psychopathic old white bastards want. and if you think that was racist who else is hell bent on Conquering the goddamn world. Cricket's exactly.
FastTX FiveOh	Same folks say All Lives Matter
Comrade	Yup. I figured this out a while ago. Trump slaps on the mask of the deep state and squeels like a piggy to let the world know what these people truly represent. Obama was a 2 sided horse face liar who would only say what he was allowed to say, so he was useless.
Vegan4ThePlanet	No one gave a shit when Obama killed women and children and a leader and plunged a profitable country into actually slavery.  People dont give a shit it seems when it is their side doing it.  I despise both sides. I joined the Greens.  #Peace
Eric Johnson	And who is Pompeo‚Äôs boss Thick Jimmy?
michael nola	Just another failed and immoral policy begun by that "socialist Muslim" Obama.

Wim van de Sande	They dismembered him...... Like a Turkey! Have a good one people! Greets and greens,Holland!       love you re works Jimmy!!!     you opened my eyes!  THANX FOR THAT!!!
Vaughn Gainey	The points Jimmy made towards the end of the video were great. It's always been the people's responsibility to hold our elected officials accountable no matter how much we like them.
Sarah Arnett	tulsiiii
Potted Rodent	If Tulsi has real conviction about the things she says, she will have to leave the democratic party.
Richard Leighton	Saudi will be the the leader of the Muslim World. For usa.
Justin McCann	Jimmy Dore is THE BEST political comentator on the web.
Mike Slaughter	Who shames Jimmy,  fuck them Jimmy is awesome!!
Chris Asterion	Jimmy Dore is THE REVOLUTION..!!!
exhippie503 ommp	These bombs are a cover for Gina Haspel torture tape cover up queen having a meeting with the Turks to make another set of tape's disappear, ordered by Trump. He could shoot some one and not lose a republican vote, so anything to keep the media off balance and follow his WWE resoling show, while his friends/family steals everything from the people of the united States. By the way every country is trying to make this go away so they can keep that sweet hydrocarbon cash packing into their rectums! It is a tyrant thing.
Dennis S	The US has become the Empire from Star Wars,  in a divided country like we have no one man ( President) is going to change this,
daguard411	Ms McKay should , due to her voice, should be the the one talking people in from the ledge, of negotiating with hostage takers. I know her kids live in fear of a deep sigh.......
Jae Lynn	Yeah, I'm done donating to disasters caused by the MIC.  I've done it my whole life and I suspect not all the money raised goes to those who we were donating to.
ProleCenter	America doesn't do anything at any other country's behest. America calls the shots. Israel and Saudi Arabia fight over who gets to be America's bottom bitch.
Richard Mays	Trump should meet in the back room with MBS so they can rub an orb together. That‚Äôll help, right? Then he can tell MBS: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my kinda guy!
jaydenrock	This is time for the right and left come together. If the people come at Trump about this and show they don‚Äôt want this then things would change. Trump cares about nothing more than his ego and that can‚Äôt be bruised by his own side.
Yuri muckraker	so glad Jimmy and Nellie called out Bernie who sadly most of his career beginning in the 90s was being a socialist reformer at home but an imperialist overseas with his support to bomb Serbia like Dresden and Tokyo at the end of World War II, he supported Daniel Ortega but now thinks leaders like Chavez and Maduro and Ortega are communist dictators, he supported the destruction of Libya and Syria and backing 'moderate rebels there' and his foreign policy is identical to Trump in that Bernie wants 'the Saudis and Gulf States to fight ISIS and get their hands dirty' completely missing the fact that Tulsi pointed out which is the Gulf States export Wahabi/Salafist termites across the globe and Syria and Yemen is ground zero for it. oh and Bernie pushes Anti-Russia hysteria, is progressive on everything except Palestine not supporting BDS or the one state solution and his Anti-Russia hysteria discredits Wikileaks and the DNC insider who blew the whistle and he didn't support the DNC lawsuit. have that as leader of a revolution or a any political party? no thanks!
Nicecore	Excellent clip Jimmy and team. Only be careful not to draw an equivalence between Assad and the Saudi regime - Assad is a genuinely popular and progressive figure in Syria.
kell	To make a somewhat shallow point, much prefer you showing your grey hair, Jimmy. Very distinguished. Never liked the dyed look.
bogoljub djordjevic	man this girl have really soft voice she is good for reading before sleep
Zohebali Khan	I was surprised that people are surprised that a journalist was killed. What do people expect when you back 73% of the worlds despotic regime's not to mention the war in Yemen, Syria etc? PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE AT SOME POINT!! DUH!!!   This is why I like Jimmy, the only voice of reason on the media.

TheSwordfish009	Like I say all the time on this comment section:  Ultimately, the responsibility rests on the American people. They do not know shit about politics nor do they even try. They just sit on their asses watching TV, drugged on prescription meds, sedated on weed, drowned in alcohol.   Any time I talk about politics in an educated way, people look at me crazy, left or right.   No wonder corporatists take advantage of you. I'm now making great money teaching English in China, paying 0-400 in rent per month, 8% tax rate, and investing bags into real estate. People still look at me crazy even on that. Even my fellow Western/American teachers still have that leftover cluelessness and blow all of their money on hanging out and hookers instead of on stocks and real estate to retire early in 5-10 years.    Idiots. Responsibility rests on your shoulders. Trump isn't going to save you and nor is Bernie.
Sumonbilla Pani Poth	Empire must Backup Wahabizm to protect their PetroDollar(Henri Kissinger ) for the Interest of Zionism üíØüíØ
Charles Nelson	No...you're kidding me...the US is selling ARMS?!!!!! To unscrupulous regimes? Never. How dare you suggest such a thing... "President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, will leave office in a few weeks with the dubious honor of having sold more weapons than any other American president since World War II."  Jimmy, you are a likeable sort, and I know that your heart is kinda in the right place...but your partisan position on issues such as arms sales doesn't do much for your credibility.
Tim Bradley	I Love Tulsi. I Love Jimmy et al. These are beautiful people.
Simon the Likeable	The Yinon Plan has no place for the Shia.
Bruce L	We took the opium Jimmy
Greg Last	I heard that saudi precision missiles are given coordinates  by american command and control centres...... if this were iran the conservative war hawks would be doing summersaults angrily... and tell me who uses chemical weapons in syria? Wow...... i really despise the hypocrisy.... its happening in other western states as well - british colonies and france and spain - germany were the only ones who halted their weapon sales. Can someone tell me what China and Russia are selling to the sauds?
Sue Damonus	Saudi‚Äôs chop people up every day.  Nothing new here.  Love Islamic law....  takes brutality to a higher level.
Sahil Jam	It's not Democrat vs Republican. It's not even established vs anti-establishment. (suddenly all Trumpers are excusing Saudi Arabia of all godforsaken places). It's the war party vs The common people.
Loup DeFer	58 kids and what .... No " but the babies the little babies ".... I guess it only matter if you have agenda behind it.

Seth Roback	If you go against the war machine, you get suicided.
Nikolas B	Saudi Arabia¬†committed this blatant act of terrorism (Murder of Khashoggi) as a BIG¬†FU to¬†the world!!
John Bauernfeind	Notice when tulsi says Obama's name and trump being involved, only photos of trump with the Saudi's is shown, there are so many photos of Obama with them too...
Just for Fun	Jimmy just come out and say it every county and every state in the U. S. And every country around this crazy f#ckin world we live in are so f#ckin corrupt it stinks like the f#ckin amish and they really f#ckin stink !
David Primeau	Thanks Jimmy, this has been going on before Trump. Obama was the saviour of the world but he continued to sell them weapons and is complicit in the modern Yemen war which started during his reign. It would be nice to see Trump walk away from this, but I doubt we will see it.
Vasantha Perera	Donald Pump and Mike Pumpeo.....a pair of real pumpers.
Bernie Holland	As of this moment everyone has caved, except Germany and Spain. Our UK government here is spineless and venal - but they will be toast at the next Election - How do I know that ? Because I am out campaigning with the UK Labour Party  Campaign Team and people are not swallowing the lies told them about Jeremy by the National Press (The Sun - The Daily Mail being the worst culprits) who have, for the last 5 years orchestrated a smear campaign accusing JC of being, amongst other things, an anti-semite. But we are on our way to one million who have pledged support many of who keep us going with donations - ordinary folk giving a few quid each, rather than corporate donors, lobbying groups and 'special interests' who, in fact, actually comprise this Tory Government which we are going to defeat by a landslide victory. I have already spoken to Fabian Hamilton who is going to head the Ministry of Peace - yes you heard that right, the Ministry of Peace - because the truth is that, right now, no country has a 'defence department' - just substitute 'offense' for 'defence' and you got the picture. Through people-power and activism we are going to remove our government - just sit back and watch us - or better still do the same for yourselves over there in the Divided States instead of using this as subject matter for your "chat shows' - valuable and informing as they may be. We have programmes of education so that those who are not sure whether to flip or not, are presented with the harsh realities, as identified by the likes of Peter Joseph, Chris Hedges, Ralph Nader, Jill Stein, Peter Lavelle, Jesse Ventura and others, too humorous to mention.  As the UK abandons its "special relationship" with the Divided States (kept divided by the Permanent State) the hegemony will frack and crumble. De-dollarisation will bring your slave masters to their feet - and in retribution for the way your continent has been raped and sodomised, gentle Gaia will roll over in her gentle slumber summoning Saint Andrea and Humboldt to shake in indignation, causing a substantial strip of land-mass immediately west of the Rockies to tumble into the Pacific, and that's not to mention the possibility of an asteroid impact. This will be the collective karma of your great nation unless you mobilise everywhere. You must bring your enemies to your cause by remembering this truth "Attack the idea - not the person" and it is here where so many opportunities are being missed - but time is short - and talk is cheap.
Billie Bleach	Jimmy, as usual, is keeping his eye on the ball. And not affraid to pull the trigger...even if he gets sprayed ‚Äúby friendly fire‚Äù for it.
FreedomFox1	The threshold for the US press to speak against the interests of the Deep State is that one of their own needs to be literally dismembered by a close US ally.

parker469a	I don't know where else to post this but I'm pretty sure 2 minutes of your Chris Mathews to Phil Donahue: You're Un-American (Part 2 of 2 - TJDS) video from 4/10/2013 was edited out. I could swear Chris said something about having undeniable evidence and Phil replied you mean like the last couple wars. Then Chris sat down and quietly said "We'll we've made some mistakes" Maybe I'm crazy or it was in another video but I could swear it was in this one.
Mr fas	The west was upset because one journalist was killed but not even 10% media coverage was given to the fact that tens thousand of Yemeni children are dying from starvation! Saudi princes can kill Arab children but not one Arab journalist who works for the west! The fall of the west.

Aurelio Almada	Go ahead and say it Jimmy. Putin is great for standing against  U.S.  terrorism. It couldn't be any clearer then what it is. Without the Putin factor. Imagine what it would be like Black people in Libya sold in open markets, famine in Yemen, israely atrocities and I can go on. Tell it like it is
Unfettered Fire	This incident, factual or not, nearly caused the shutdown of the SA Davos forum in Riyadh. Was that the desired outcome? Does Israel and the US not want SA to overstep its boundaries and build up its business presence internationally? Because why would MbS pull this stunt right before it and jeopardize billions in deals? https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-conference-crown-prince-mohammed.html?fbclid=IwAR1qAfmYraO-BKTZwfEO1y3Lu_Eegqjr63UcvJJBFWeAb2Npz7k4yCzc9Kg

HiroCheeseMuh	Best way to change all this shit is go #GreenOrBust. Voting for Dems (even the so called ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ones) only means more of the same. To paraphrase Jimmy (or someone Jimmy like) ‚Äúthere has never been a Green Party candidate where I‚Äôve been like ‚Äòfuck that guy‚Äô I don‚Äôt agree with his/her platform at all‚Äù #GreenOrBust or people need to stop bitching about things they‚Äôre complicit in making sure  happen!
WahidaJoosub	Jimmy I love you but you missed Israel when you outed the biggest terrorists.  Let‚Äôs face it Saudi has learned from Israeli tactics.

Alastair Carnegie	Bashar Assad can hypnotise UN Inspectors with a his MAGIC MIND CONTROL BUNNY RABBIT. That Forces over 70% of the Syrian Population to vote for him. He is far more wicked than we could ever imagine. The United Nations Inspectors declared that all the chemical weapons allegations against Assad were TOTAL NONSENSE...!!!! ...  What more proof do we need! BE WARNED! DO NOT WATCH ANY VIDEO INTERVIEWS WITH BASHAR ASSAD..... The Magic Bunny Rabbit will take over your mind, just like it forced thousands of Journalists to claim he was a Medical Doctor specialising in eyes. after training in a London Hospital,... "Ophthalmologist"  more like The Evil Eye-thalmologist! ...  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
Arthur Fallowfield	Tulsi, a good politician, listen to her.  She is not bought.  Thus she tells the truth.
Robert Allen	Nellie <3
B. Greene	Those weapon sales were going to PRIVATE corporations. Why is our government engaged in genocide on behalf of private corporations? It‚Äôs not Constitutional, and it sure isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfree market capitalism ‚Äú. Those companies could be building solar panels and wind farms to get us out of the Mideast forever and save Americans trillions. They could be building infrastructure, but no. War is what the ATL council (misspelling it on purpose) wants to drive our entire economy. We are the evil empire.

arnold trogman	Bernie Sanders introduced legislation months ago to try to stop  American involvement with Saudi Arabia and put some pressure to stop the war in Yemen.  you need to include his name as well since he'll be the one running for president wirh.. hopefully.. Tulsi Gabbard as his vice presidential running mate..#SandersGabbard2020
Trotsky or Bust	Love how you blame Israel.   Good thing you're not an Anti-Semite.
Stephanie Gilley	Jimmy, there is a video clip of John Kerry saying that the Saudis were willing to pay us to destroy/regime change the Middle East. Why the fuck are these psychopaths allowed to do whatever they want at our expense, in our name?
M Jave	It‚Äôs only to b1@ckmailing to get cheap oil sell more we@pons and nutsnyahoo wants more land .
moochy the cat	ISRAEL IS A BIGGER TERRORIST, MURDEROUS SHIT STAIN THAN SAUDI ARABIA AND AMERICA COMBINED.
UpYours	Yeah the UN, the organisation that put the Saudis on the women's rights commission, is an extremely credible source.
ubon11	The Saudis are not going to accept Iranians on their border in Yemen, regardless of what the US does or doesn‚Äôt do.  The Saudis will fight until the Iranian threat is dispatched in Yemen.  So with this in mind, why shouldn‚Äôt we sell them weapons? Because if we don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll get them from somewhere else anyway.  Of course, on the other side, Russia is supplying the Houthis indirectly( Iran‚Äôs proxy).  Jimmy‚Äôs stance on this whole issue would make more sense if he also called out the other side (Russia, Iran) for supplying arms as well.  But at the same time, why not assist the Saudis to take down Iran a notch or two?  The Iranians are much more of a terrorist problem around the world than the Saudis are.  Sorry if this fact upsets Jimmy‚Äôs listeners who are in the bag for Russia (RT America) and by association, Iran.  I like Jimmy‚Äôs opinion quite a bit, but I don‚Äôt agree with his opinion on Yemen.  I can only assume he is being paid by Russia to take the side of the Iranians?  I‚Äôm not sure, but I just don‚Äôt understand his position on Yemen for the life of me.

Donald Ganley	Bernie has rendered himself irrelevant.  He helped awaken the giant, but now he wants to put it back to sleep, as long as Israel is getting mostly what it wants. He is an integral part of the babble that leads us nowhere.

Helmet Barf	What's this "we" shit? I didn't sell a god damn thing to Saudi Arabia. Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Lockheed, General Dynamics etc. etc. sold weapons to Saudi Arabia. I didn't vote for those chumps, I don't work for those people, and I don't approve of jack-shit they do. So there is no "we". There is only "they".
Kirby M	Nellie makes great points, but she needs to get closer to the mic.

AndTheCorrectAnswerIs	Muslims have been killing each other for 1400 years....I am fine with selling them weapons to keep on doing it. I just don't want any US troops involved, and I don't want US taxpayer's money going to rebuild foreign countries ravaged by the wars of foreign dictators.
The Last And First Time	Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.  Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence‚Äîeconomic, political, even spiritual‚Äîis felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.  -Dwight D. Eisenhower  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBNmecVtdU
CKB	double standards: the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggieg and the killing of DR KELLY. what's the difference?,

Kie Dan	Ponceo is nothing more than a mafia pos soldier in service of the yank imperium
Scott R.	They will kill him if he stops the wars...he found that out when they threatened him...he called their bluff, but for now its not in their best interest to do it...hes still got the wars going on....
Slew One	Jimmy, there are more than one Politician who wants to end it.   Rand Paul is concern about Yemen.
Mr Magoo	WORD. Jimmy.
One of Five	war criminals of the white house don't have respect for human lives. trump or whatever else dickhead plays the role of a "president". same shit ndifferent day. a face of the USA never changes.
BarbarraBay	Bernie is a kook. Pay the money and watch "Bernie Sanders to the Woodshed" by Ryan Dawson ANC Report.
Rev. Stephen A. Cakouros	‚ÄúFor gold, men, rich and poor like, will do anything; create bubble companies, sell their daughters into gilded misery, begin and continue wars. The sin of the world is not the sin of unbelief. Men do not disbelieve. The sin of the world is the sin of Judas. They sell Christ.‚Äù  [Dean Farrar]
Crystal Sanders	Bernie's Russia bull shit (where his  face tenses up and his eyes go cold) really made me sick to watch.  But then I thought of his popularity and the insane voter fraud with a significant portion of the media calling him a sexist,  a crazy old man,  a hopeless candidate,  a failed politician whose made no impact of legislation.  I remember Jane being sued. And articles about a $300 coat and a lake house. If he left the democrats and started or encouraged a new party none of them would have got on board for Medicare for all a fair minimum wage and no corporate PAC money. Yes,  we know most of the dems new stances on what Obama might refer to as a good new idea such was his recent stance on a single payer system (which he campaigned on so it wasn't a new idea), but now they are on the record so that new progressives have a chance with the ability to access the internet and find all of these facts, and being inside the hive is better in his mind regarding a system that has become one big blob is better than having them fight against you and shit as hard as they can on humane ideals simply bc you started your own movement.
rcaugh	You go Jimmy. Keep telling it like it is. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüòò
che zus	some total moron at politicon tried to made the "argument" that the journalist the saudis murdered was a friend of osama bin laden... i'm quite confident that having interviewed a wahhabi terrorist leader is gonna be the reason why american propaganda will say it's ok for a wahhabi terrorist regime to murder a mildly critical journalist.  15 saudis (and 4 people from other countries) fly planes into american landmarks, and that justifies bombing afghanistan and iraq even though the (saudi born) mastermind behind the attack sits in pakistan and not a single hijacker was from either afghanistan or iraq; the saudi government murders a journalist, and the journalist is blamed. the saudis commit war crimes in yemen like preventing food and medical supplies from getting into the country while they're targeting school buses in order to massacre children, and the US directly supports them in that war. killing a single journalist isn't suddenly gonna end that alliance.
Alexis Wilmot Porter	I don't want to hear any more nonsense about the Skripals' non-assassination after this Kashoggi whitewash. Fancy that! Russia didn't get a fair hearing! What a shock! But the Saudis... Maybe Putin should offer to buy some US/Alliance weapons - then all would be fine. Only they are rubbish and even the Saudis think the S-400 is better than some crummy Patriot junk. Bravo Jimmy! Keep on telling it like it is, despite the cynicism and bitterness that inevitably follows when few want to hear it...
M Krump	Trump is not happy! now Yeah it was...  11:48 hahah
chickendinner2012	Stop all weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and stop all military assistance to them. They are committing genocide in Yemen.
SedonaHealthCoach	It's not that they killed a journalist . . . .  it's that they murdered him by dismembering him while he was alive after injecting him with chemicals that paralyzed him to make it easier for the butcher to saw apart his body. Then I would not be surprised to hear that he was their dinner. Americans have become desensitized with so much war but this kind of psychotic behavior is still a shock!
Online News Network	Why doesn't America sell weapons to the Palestinians so they can defend themselves. Why does America del weapons to Saudis but not Yemenis? How much longer till America becomes so sick with the cancer of iniquity that  it begins to eat itself away. 2 or even 3 states within the United States exists.
Dzahui	If a nightclub jagoff comedian could see through Trump's faux anti-war stance, why couldn't more people? I didn't believe a word Trump said off the fact that he's a billionaire.
Twirlip Of The Mists	"Journalist."
Drake Koefoed	This is the holocaust.  What happened in the 40's is overshadowed, and it was trump, mcconnell and the rest of that gang who made it possible.  They are co-conspirators and guilty of the crime of the century
augenbutter	The permanent state runs the show. The parties doing the dance on stage. Let's expose and hold accountable the DEEP OVERLORDS! But that's easier said than done, given their power over everything and the fact that too many keep watching their staged shows.  Live the world you want to be in.
Robert Bennett	"120,000 precision guided missiles." How much death and destruction does that translate into! (Sigh) ... It's exasperating to see the Military Economic Paradigm piss away  wealth , prosperity and peace. I suspect the middle of the gaussian curve America want an end to this insanity, but the left/right political theater perpetually keeps this obscene Economic System in Power.
c reed	And that extra military money went to Israel to bomb Gaza and Syria and fund ISIS/rebels.
Omar Ahmed	Blowing up people and cutting them up is ok
Johnny Aingel	Interesting about weapons and money
Nomad Black	Gabbard/Bernie, never voted, would vote for this ticket.

Paul Kelly	All mankind must come together as one to step back up onto the shores of humanity.
Dave La Violette	Nellie McKay is a brilliant thinker!!
Jeremy Merrifield	Killing journalists is always big news. ISIS knew that when they killed several.
251omega	Times have sure changed!  We used to get our news from our Representatives in Congress or  from MSM News, and for relaxation, we'd turn to Comedians for laughs.  NOW, we have to get any news of value from  the later, and both of the former are one big laugh...
zahrans	A bus load of kids killed by the Saudis. Silence.  A somewhat prominent but well connected Saudi journo killed by the Saudis. Everyone loses their minds.

Jillylove 101	KSA actually butchered the guy, like with real bone üçñ saws, and targets children, like Israel does. USA bombs schools and hospitals. There is no reason that passes the sanity test. Making weapons is not a noble occupation.
Harrison Rutledge	And all these trump supporters think trump is fighting the deep state lol...no, he works for them!!! Trump supporters don‚Äôt get it.
Kevin Kranz	MILITARY COMPLEX IS OUT OF HAND BUSH RUN DEEPSTATE USING OUR MONEY TO KILL INNOCENT POEPLE OVER OIL AND GCR THAT IS COMING. SOON AMEN. HELP THESE POEPLE NOT KILL THEM. AMEN
m.youtube.com	thanks Jimmy
bigbabyzubas	Its like "Lord Of War" we know they are going to use the weapons to massacre people.....but we HAVE TO SELL THOSE GUNS!   Thats how you know the MIC controls all parts of the American Government.   When common sense goes out the window in weapons sales.
Julio Sanchez	3,000 Americans died at 9/11 and they didn't care, why would they care for a journalist?

Spiritual Humanist	But this guy was CIA  so he is more important then Yemeni kids.
John Mc	Republicans support war because they're xenophobic and essentially racist. Democrats like Chuck Schumer do it, at least in the Middle East, because it's what Israel wants. Democrats who war monger are almost always Zionists or under their influence.
D N	Trump himself said that he could murder someone in Time Square and he'd still win elections.
George Sears	tim kaine is a sack of shit.
888strummer	Dore blames the U.S. and Saudia Arabia for deaths in Yemen???  There are deaths because of the Yemen civil war and they are having a civil war because the Sunnis and Shiites in Yemen hate each other.  So with or without America there would be death anyway.  We decided to fund and provide logistics for the lesser of 2 evils.  Maybe we should stay out of it, but if we did, there would still be 1,000's of deaths as Yemen is in a civil war; with or without us.  Jimmy Dore purposely doesn't actually tell his viewers who is fighting; he just trashes America and gets his audience sucked into his emotional rants.  Iran is backing the Houthi Shiites and Saudi Arabia is backing the Sunnis; that's what this is all about and we feel Iran is worse than Saudi Arabia
Brian Barbour	I learned something from this incident...Never go anywhere without your bone saw guy.
Lux Munky	Too bad she didn‚Äôt go one step further and call out Jake Tapper for ignoring US military support of SA because the media is bought and paid by the weapons manufacturers.
caligirl	Thank you Jimmy. As and Iranian-American I can't think of a peaceful moment in the Middle East, because of Petrodollar and Saudi-US influence.
Karl Knight	Excellent. Nellie Makay's point on "without an international solidarity movement, we're not standing on firm ground" resonated with me. It saddened me as well. It seems that humans are too tribalistic/nationalistic to ever form an international movement of solidarity. Though, I love how she longs for that. I do too.
Miles Jackson	So they're just admitting out in the open that they sell weapons of war for money, and nobody cares? I'm sure their pawns will justify that while simultaneously acting like we're still spreading democracy.
UnHappy Gilmore	"Don't take it personal, it's just business." As said by many a scum bag.
Oliver Hancock	I sympathize with the terrorists who kamikazed the Pentagon on 9/11. I disagree with their methods. They were reckless with innocent lives who had nothing to do with their plight. Those in the plane they hijacked likely had nothing to do with America's tyranny. I sympathize with them though. No doubt many of the 184 lives taken at the Pentagon on that day would've been funding the killing of children in the middle-east today if they had not been killed on 9/11. Can we really consider every American who died on 9/11 innocent? To accept and fund and elect people who sponsor our own terrorism, but condemn the terrorism of foreigners is extremely hypocritical.
probie brutus	I could listen to Nellie's voice all day
bengt baron	Whos crying over a dude who worked with Osama and is a Muslim Brotherhod top head according to professor Marxist!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRG8lA3v0sg&t=9s

Steven Kirmaier	America has done the worst crimes around world with Military & CIA!
Ken Parker	Once famines use to devastate countries due to natural events. Now it's natural for famines to be used to devastate countries.
David Taggart	CNN puts on Tulsi Gabbard to get Democrats who are thinking of abandoning the party to still keep voting Democrat. She's only one Progressive surrounded by hundreds of Corporate Democrats.  Need a Third Party! No offence Greens.

Aleksandar Joksimovic	Chomski + FDR = Jimmy
LSG	Weird that the U.S. is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, the biggest sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism in the world, while simultaneously beating the war drums against Iran. Coincidentally, these are the exact same policies as Israel.
Gargantuan Z	Bone saw made in USA
Brian Jacobsen	President of the US is not a leader of a country. He a fucking salesman.
Daniel Clint	Assad was never the bad guy. Assad simply refuses to be dictated to by the Unites States and Saudi Arabia.
Orlando Olmo	When Drunpf says we have spent bla blah trillions and got nothing out of it. He means "HE" didn't get anything out of it. That is why he made new weapons deals. Ones where he obviously got a commission.  #doretothetruth #dore2020 #bellstillrings #stillsubscribed #whereisthemillionsubscribersYT?
140 Ex	What? Mike (never seen combat) Pompeo is a war monger? Why do we keep pretending that the POTUS is actually running things? Bankers in the shadows are really pulling the strings of power. It isn‚Äôt about principle, it‚Äôs about who‚Äôs in control.

John Doe	The weapons sales is a small part of it. The larger part, perhaps 95%, is the petrodollar. The Saudis have us by the balls and they know it.
tsnorquist	We've been mercing innocent people for decades. Saudis been mercing innocent people for decades.  Everyone in the world have been mercing innocent people for decades.
Larkinchance	There is no peace movement because the mass surveillance is in place.  People feel that if they protest their back ground will be checked or they will lose their jobs..  Tuition in college is too high for students to risk demonstrating. The next step will be political arrests..

Amy H	Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, GE, etc. and the politicians who protect them and support their business are worse than drug dealers. At least with drug dealers the people they "hurt" chose to be hurt but no one chose to be bombed by our politicians.
Noonelikes Aknowitall	Jimmy you‚Äôre right we have to hold politicians accountable but you can‚Äôt bash Bernie in one breath and praise Ro Khanna in the other when he voted to increase the military budget in this last vote. Ask Khanna why he did that if he‚Äôs so anti war.
Don Quixote	Jimmy, at 6:27...  I don't fall on the left side of the isle, and I don't agree with some things that are said on your program, but I like your discussions and there's stuff like the perpetual wars, and corporate gigantism/oppression that I'd certainly join you on...  You're one of my most watched programs.  Please continue...
BB1349	The Palestine resistance both Fatah and Hamas have supported the Saudi war in Yemen. Sick.
Arturo Esquina	Bernie was the first politician to make me give a fuck.... and then he sold out to Hilary and confirmed the fact that we have no vote! it's all bullshit! grow your own food save water wait for the revolution!!
imsweetleaf	Good to have you back. #AntiWar #NoMoreWar
Brandon Christopher	Jimmy, I love ya and Stef and Ron..BUT..Cover the migrant ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù
Kathleen Lowy	but part of the plan was to get US citizens dependent on weapons sales‚Äîany politician who votes down arms sales or closing military bases will lose their jobs‚Äî-because the military and defense spending is the only halfway decent job in town... this evil has become embedded into everyday American life..... very sad
P. Ness	Great show Jimmy.  I love your anti war attitude. 60% of our fed. tax dollar goes towards murderous invasions. The civilians pay the ultimate price. Our government is morally corrupt.      Tulsi for President!
Seth Sternin	I know this is totally off-topic, but doesn‚Äôt Nellie McKay remind you of Mia Farrow with the voice of Diane Keaton? It‚Äôs like she came right out a mash-up of the movies Hannah and Her Sisters, Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall. Just me?
hermenutic	This report of political decision making  made me recall "Button Button" a Twilight Zone Episode.  https://youtu.be/PLsMgho0GT8  When war is your business peace is your enemy and lockstep conformity is demanded of the citizen. Push the button...
Daisy Skye	If it takes a sociopathic Neoliberal Fascists like Trump to light a fire under everyones ass and expose the war crimes of the Oil & War profiteers and kleptocrats, personally I don't give a shit. Just WAKE THE FUCK UP already, because we're running out of runway.
Magister R'yleth	Hey Jimmy, you know that Russia or China would jump on this opportunity to support an illegal war, right? What are you, a commie spy? Are you even American? Look, bombs may have been dropped on children, but at least they were American bombs. They could've been Russian bombs. If anyone should profit off of the murder of innocents, it should at least be the good ol' US of A.
Ju Bu	This is winning in the real word according to Trump. Charlie sheen was less of a fruit cake when he was winning with a smoke hanging from each nostril.
arthur granopoulos	I think the thing that is most interesting thing about this so called jernelest is his connection to the Iran/Contra affair as you are talking about arms deals
Gregory Wonderwheel	Khashoggi was a CIA asset given a cover job at the CIA backed newspaper the Washington Post. He was considered a CIA asset because he was always loyal to the despotic monarchy crime family of Saud and then detected to the US when the princes who were his patrons lost their standing in the crime family.  TULSI!!!!! Now our best progressive in the House.
Major Major	True, think about it, these godless egotistical leaders have been killing anyone who gets on the way of the almighty dollar. Thanks for courage to call a spade a spade. Trump at least ia honest enough to say it.
RD Patterson	Khashoggi fought with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 80's. It's all theater/ The Prince crossed the line by not getting the ok from the CIA first.
branden burks	Bernie Sanders has been co-opted
Christobal Colombo	Military industrial complex first

Rabbi Jim Foroud Behizadeh	the journalist is alive
Jeremy Elliot	This shit makes me angry. Fuck you, America. I know it's your government and I'm sure some of the best Americans are right here in Jimmy's comments section - but you need to understand that it gets harder and harder to not just think "fuck you, America". You must try to control this shit. Your country is the Evil Empire.
david b	Assad fun fact.... He drives himself to work.
W Meito	Bernie Sanders is the only democrat to not have voted for the bloated military budget.
Scrambled Eggs	We are in a sad state.  Democrats are the same as Republicans
Secular reflecter	Yes, and this nasty, genocidal war is peculiarly ignored by the "left", which prefers to pillory Israel for crimes that amount to spilt milk in comparison.  This is where the hypocrisy of identity politics plays out big time.
Jay Parks	Trump is not a man he is a animal mental patient who desperately needs a hospital bed and stray jacket.
Alaskan PowerLine Adventures Anchorage Alaska	Jimmy..Jimmy..Jimmy. Don't you know the journalist killed was not an American citizen?  We need all the advanced weapons in Saudi Arabia. . In case we need to kill an actual American citizen on foreign oil. ..oops I meant soil.
Conan0Brady	How much money did the Saudis give Trumps daughter?
NothingMaster	If our government has truly been found to have had an active hand in prolonging and exasperating the war in Yemen,  just to be able to sell arms that could invariably lead to the massacre of countless innocent civilians, then it is just as atrocious and morally bankrupt as those that it identifies as terrorists and rogue states.   You can‚Äôt sustain a civilized nation on the backs of hypocrisy and the blood of the innocent; at least not for long.  A nation that loses its trust and respect for its leadership, democratic values, and governmental institutions is a nation in serious trouble.   An incompetent and divisive leadership that places short-term gains over and above our cherished American ideals is an agent of treachery and treason.
Lee & Caroline	For the first time that I'm aware of, mainstream media BBC did a full segment on the war in Yemen and at last told it from the side of the people who are being persecuted. Finally a fair and balanced article that very probably pissed off the corporations. For once... well done BBC
equinos111	Obama did the same fucking thing. This country is fucking done. Morally bankrupt society
Stephen Little	Look a bit deeper and you see that war will not solve anything. There is no point to it today except one The End. Selling weapons and oil is not what it is about. Armeggedon is what that these lunatic cults want so that their messiahs and rebbes will return. They are killing the planet any way they can.
CorModo	Imagine being Pompeo, in the eternal moment of the afterlife, when he's forced to face the souls of the people he has prematurely pushed out of existence, so his greasy persona could fit nice into established order of things... Or you better don't.

Carrie Hatzlhoffer	Whatever, women can drive.
Jan Nem	The Saudis are primitive savages with access to modern technology. But despite all those petrodollars, savagery, indiscriminate attacks on Yemeni civilians... they are still getting their asses handed to them by barefoot yemeni militias. The Yemen war is a goldmine for US & western arms dealers - the Houtis are popping Saudi hardware like fireworks and the Saudis have infinitelly deep pockets. All that production, energy & money for fucking nothing... Nothing is created in the end, just lots of destroyed hardware lying in the desert.

Ronald Bendixen	Thank you¬†Jimmy.
cardigansrule	America is a bomb factory. That's it. Nutshell. Simplest terms. America is a bomb factory.
John Dickinson	4:29 ‚ÄûOnce weapons were manufactured to fight wars. Now wars are manufactured to sell weapons.‚Äú
Ian Sheehy	He backed the beheading of 200 Syrian soldiers as a valid psychological tactic in war. Fuck him. Whenever a story makes it to the mainstream, we have to question it.Btw in 2013, Assad was voted the most popular Arab leader, by CNN Arabic with 67% of the vote. Everyone pls watch Scott Ritters speech on Iraq/Syria/Libya. It explains it totally.
Gore Shade	Tulsi is former military like me, so you notice the extra details she confers in her interview. Not just the sales of weapons, but the targeting intel, but the refueling, and general support. The things she mentions, always excluded from the dumbed down mainstream "reporting", require a lot of other logistics. Selling precision weapons requires, precision training, support, and servicing for the systems. The targeting requires satellites and entire teams of multiple intelligence disciplines (and there are a lot of technical ones used for this). The "other" intel she mentions may actually mean we have "boots on ground" gathering it in Yemen. When the military drops bombs or uses missiles, they don't just show up use their toys and go home, they love to have observers in place on the ground or have follow up flights to review the damage. They use these to make reports which asses the effectiveness of the weapons and methods used, ie product reviews. Tulsi, gave us a few extra details, I only skim the surface of the support needed for the things she mentioned. It doesn't take much for you to consider how many people it takes to provide that support we are giving Saudi Arabia in terms of logistics and manpower or how many people it takes to support them in terms of food and shelter and equipment. We aren't just selling weapons, we are in the war itself.
MaxSantos	Take a look at Jake's words "... beyond that ..." , as to say "because ending US support to SA is out of the table... what else you got?!?!"
Christrian Jameson	SJW and people on the left who are saying all the worlds troubles started with trump should learn some history and the uk‚Äôs involvement in Saudi Arabia goes back generations
EE CC	If the Saudis are willing to do that to a journalist inside a consulate, imagine what they do to Yemen!
Paraguay Mike	Bernie is just another dirtbag politician. There are no good ones. Period.
Kevin L Sims	We Need the Damn Saudi's! We are Dependent on Gas! We can not have a Barrel of oil go up to $200-$300! If gas goes up to $5 a gallon it will collapse our economy then there will mass suicide and you will have to defend your home with an AK to keep the starving people from taking what little bit of food you will be able to afford!
Vincenzo	"God is pro-war," said Rev. Jerry Falwell in 2004 (quoted by Sheldon Wolin  in "Democracy Incorporated"). Unfortunately, he's not burning in hell because hell is here on earth, and it's perpetrated by the first-world's military-industrial complex.
Sandor Daroci	LOL, trump is making mooolah for ya'll...LOL
elizabeth chaparro	Just as a footnote this journalist worked for the deep state, research it please. Not that this justifies his killing.
Joe Paul	All this is b.s. for attacking Iran....since Venezuela went off the the dollar....they may be next....already tried to kill him last month
DarkSideSixOfficial	No shit Sherlock, you realize the CIA was formed outside of the constitution and acts outside of the constitution, has its own illegal court, it's own illegal military arm, with various illegal military bases around the globe? Lol, profit is their motto.
Gnuggets11	Just for the record, chris hayes did cover the Yemeni bus of children being blown up by Lockheed Martin missles sold from the US, on MSNBC (miraculously), and jimmy covered chris covering it lol
James Cameron	Reality is one bitch of a pill to swallow.  The democrats as bad as the republicans?  We as bad as the Saudis? When are we going to come clean and end the facade?  The whole thing sickens me. Literally, makes me ill.  We ARE the terrorists, and we need to stop!

Willis Sears	Saudi Arabia has three embassies in the U.S..  one in Washington D.C.,  New York and Houston tx.  You can see why they would have one in each of these states.  The Saudi hijackers of 911 attacked the U.S. to destroy our financial district and military intelligence community.  The hijackers were protesting the relationship between the US and Saudi's.  They were hoping that America would retaliate against Saudi Arabia but we all know what happened and why now.

Herb Levin	Israel has shot 140+ kids and 7 journalists so far this year an no media.
Alan Draycott	We have the same problem here in the UK Jimmy,all the media including the BBC up in arms about the murder of a journalist but have nothing to say about close to genocide of Yemeni civilians.
Benno Witter	I know that some people are into this ASMR stuff, but I find this whispering woman very annoying.
Ted Kidd	Serena Shim was a journalist.  Khashoggi is/was(?) Muslim Brotherhood arms dealer.
NightStalkerDNS	Trump: "Countries need to start paying us to invade, occupy and destroy their countries". I mean what is this? People expect it for free? Commie socialists I tell you
Patrick McCormack	I'm beginning to think certain "progressives" are guilty of crashing the movement for a 2nd-Bill-of-Rights.
Michael MJL	UK also contributed to creation of PetroDollar (Kashoggi brokered all the big arms for oil dollars deals) right after the Arab Jewish War. See BBC doc on YT Adam Curtis "Bitter Lake" . UK economy and hegemony was going down the drain when Saud was pissed the West backed the Jews and restricted oil production.
Shane Smith	Actually the three biggest terrorist nations are America, Saudi Arabia, and zionist Israel. We can't forget about zionist Israel and how they are about to invade Palestine and possibly Syria. They have dozens of tanks on the boarder ready to invade at a moments notice.
digital tyranny	If you are successful in uniting the working class, it goes much farther than Democrat pundits attacking you, they will kill you. Graham Elwood just did a great piece on this. The only way for these tyrants to retain power is to keep us divided, and they will stop at nothing to achieve this goal. TJDS, love you guys and the work you are doing, thank you for saying what others are afraid to say!
honest peter	Iran and saudi arabia are evil. Destroy them both.
jmt luimem	send this guy to Rome once a week! it's an order .
Martial Villager	Black Agenda Report exposed Bernie as an imperialist pig. It may sound like a bombastic claim, but if u look past the mythical Bernie u find a man who has been compromising with imperialism just to gain a few crumbs. He never wanted power, his Revolution talk was just a gimmick.
Mike Dunn	Glenn Greenwald and Jimmy Dore are the only socialist whack-a-doos I can listen to and it's because of stories like this. If everyone actually cared about this war issue (which is the most important and horrific issue on earth) then we could actually figure out how to see eye to eye on all of the other issues. Which would hopefully result in us peacefully splitting up and going our separate ways.
D. J.	The US is a ONE party regime.
Donald Trump.	Guys the YouTube channel ‚Äúthe progressive voice ‚Äú is smearing jimmy.   You know what to do !
Keishil Prabhudas	the Saudi Arabia fossil fuel needs to finish,  and the cunts of House of Saud will not have money for insensiable thirst for power and weapons.
kenneth osborne	The Saudi's need to be turned to glass for 9/11.
jrKid49	The more I listen to Jimmy Dore the more I agree and like the guy. Even tho he spit at my boy Alex Jones
Pablo Pastor	The BIG DEAL going on with the Saudis for years is the murder of YEMENIS PEOPLE.
fish mael	Overt narcissists are refreshingly honest compared to the old style covert ones.
Joe	Get your 3rd party and take control of your country. Support from Ireland
Snapdragon 9600	If Usa is now run and influenced by big pharmaceutical companies, weapons manufacturers, corrupt financial advisors etc, with a leader that bully's weaker nations with the threat of war and trade tax, how is that different from the Mafia, that runs drugs,loan sharks, protection rackets, trades guns, and threatens to kill those who don't comply, and also have no respect for the rule of law? Weapons manufacturers are also a protection racket. Commander in Chief? Don Trump, the Capo, more like. Not my President.
ibrahim faqai	üëç
Winnie the Shrew	How about getting Arundhati Roy on the show? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET7I9jvP4Ic ("Come September", speech, 2002)
whitelily227	Our government continues to go rogue. Americans don‚Äôt want war. We don‚Äôt want to bomb and kill people in other countries. So why aren‚Äôt the politicians that we have voted in NOT doing what we ask?
Queue Eight	anyone that listens to this orange buffoon is a buffoon......credibility and intellect of a zepo.....
Lisa Warren	For your info Jimmy, last Sunday there was a woman's march to stop war on the Pentagon not funded by Soros. 1200 showed up and Sputniknews was the only 1 reporting on it. Know what's really going on to resist. I won't trust Tulsi or Bernie.
Ilfart 218	They're doing more than just backing this war. They're pushing it we have boots on the ground through the sanitization process of "independent contractors" which is gestapo shorthand for mercenaries america has been funding the brutal suppression of the locals mostly community activists and protestors. Most of this at the hands of non saudi citizens usually israeli and american "special forces" which is just codeword for hired killers. Saudi Arabia is just a cover for the real criminals a puppet state of the masters who are actually pushing this agenda from their tower of tyranny right here in the united states.
Lee Sowden	They have no shame they make a deal with the devil and they are the country that back the terrorist and make out the country's that haven't attacked the west are the bad one and its on because they don't like capalatism
Chris Weber	Not enough outrage about Saudi Arabia! People forget 9/11 attackers were from there
Sean Degidon	It's actually worse: Arms trafficking is the PUBLIC ARGUMENT the Trump Administration is making for enabling Saudi Arabia. Given that America is now energy-independent (thank you, fracking!) the only reason I see is the money CAIR and other Saudi organs throw around Washington.
Lupee Ves II	Don't let the "Fake Progressives" get to you, Jimmy. We are not stupid enough to put too much trust in candidates./policitians. We DO NOT WANT ANOTHER OBAMA. FUCK DAVID PAKCMAN AND SAM SEDER.
Derrick Graham	This is what would happen and anti-war/peace movement started taking shape. Republicans would try to make it also a stand against Socialism and illegal immigration (but mostly Democrats). Tell them to keep it to themselves for the peace movement and they will decry censorship of conservative views. Democrats would try to make it about sexism, racism and abolishing the 2nd Amendment (but mostly Trump). Telling them to let it only be about peace would result it feminist protests of the peace movement's misogyny. Progressives won't work with anybody, even themselves. If they do, they sold out to some systemic oppression or another. Greens don't want to replace foreign oil with domestic. Libertarians aren't know for joining. Without all these groups involved, a peace movement is irrelevant noise. A peace movement could happen, but its pitfalls would have to be addressed by someone more savvy than myself.
Darksnovia	Jimmy Dore for president
ManicStreetPreacher	It stands to reason that if you want to sell weapons you need wars, otherwise everyone would have enough to 'defend themselves. It's just business. And I can recommend Assad Butchers. Their sausages are top-class!
janusz delondre	it's a price worth paying, as long as it isn't any of the 1% paying it, collateral damage means shareholders are getting wealthier, usa usa usa, it's likely that they think themselves good christians, oxymorons
ogo go	the uae guy just kidnaped and killed his own daughter, no one said anything
Public Guy	Tulsi is awesome, would love to see her as VP with Bernie, then prez the following election with maybe warren as her VP.
Voodoo Romeo 87	I will come on your show and answer questions,  great show as always. Thank you all
Robert Roth	Once Trump takes out the Deep State, many things can and will change.  Until he can do that, not much is going to change on the surface.
Bubba Zanetti	Keep telling the TRUTH! keep up the great reporting!
Lawrence Taylor	It came out that the Swiss National Bank has been financing and profiting from the US War Machine and Nuclear Weapns.  Since 2014 they have grown their investment from 450 Million to 2.05 Billion since they are just plowing their gains back into the machine.  You think having 6 media outlets is restrictive?  How about having ONE?   And they are holding the gold plated gas nozzle jammed so far up Trump's Ass that the Rolex has kidney stones.  Good show, you need to keep talking about this, I am just giving my take.  You go team.
Louis David	they don't want it to be said because they don't want us to know.
datarecoil	Its all about MONEY...if you back this COMING War you are guilty of Murder!
Nick Bellantoni	Every war that this country has been involved in since the early 1800,s has been for profit especially the wars fought from world war 1 to the present. Remember what was said in the last election, Clinton said that wars were good for business and trump said that wars are money makers, only the super rich in this country make money from war and only the department of defences and our so called intelligence agencies benefit from war, the real American people gain nothing from wars, all they get is the loss of family members who are killed in these wars and the the the high cost of the funerals for their now dead family members who did not have to fight and die in these wars.
Alexandre B.	"Bernie is a guy". That's why I love Jimmy Dore he's just so down to earth
Ima Carrot	Hillary would have had us in WW III. The CIA hads been trying to get us in WW III & to kill our President.  We are in a CIVIL WAR right now. Anyone who does not vote the GOP ticket is a TRAITOR.
Domenic Galata	I know that a lot of people don‚Äôt want war or military actions to take place,  but nothing can truly happen without it. The major problems are Saudi Arabia and Israel.  Bring them to heel and the Middle East could see peace.  This will take Iran to be brought into the fold, and as far as I see it, they could be coaxed into accepting that they will have to make concessions , but that they could be the  bulk of the ground troops and Iran would gladly take Saudi Arabia and do it quickly . Try to limit the civilian casualties and destroy every palace and Royal family property, and military installations. Israel would see this and be given two months to ratify and rubber stamp a two state solution or have all funding cut off. Israel and Saudi Arabia are the main sources of strife and until they are brought to heel, it won‚Äôt end. A new President could do this,  but the Israeli and Saudi lobby have to be abolished and silenced .
I Want Winners Produxtions	The 1950s called and said that this woman is missing, and we must return her by midnight
FactFinder	He wasn't a journalist, he was a Muslim Brotherhood Operative running the Drugs for Weapons program through Istanbul. Do you think it's weird that there are Pics of him holding a Rocket launcher but not a copy of WaPo? Wake up Jimmy. Research Air America, Muhajadeen, ISIS, CIA, AlQueda, McCain, Clinton, Obama, 9/11, POPPY Fields in Afghanistan, UN Climate Change Hoax, Behghazi. It's all connected and has nothing to do with Trump and only a little or nothing to do with oil.
Mike Fagan	Saudi Arabia would literally have to drop a nuclear warhead on one of Trump's golden palaces for the government to do anything about it.  Even then I don't expect Saudi Arabia to "pay" for it. Israel and SA make United States shareholders filthy rich. Neither can do _any_ wrong.
my view	Now imagine if 22 million people in America were suffering a cholera epidemic brought on by Russia selling billions in weapons to Mexico to bomb and kill your civilians because the dictator Mexico has running America isn't wanted by Americans.
Twostones00	The biggest terrorists are the Zionist led by Netanyahu and then his puppets Trump and the US war Machine then Saudi Arabia in that order.
Cosmic Wakes	Michael Brooks and Sam Seder push the lie that Assad is some fascist and who must be taken out and thereby Seder can continue his contributing slot at MSNBC. Seder and Brooks continue to push identity politics instead of worker unity and solidarity in order to take down capitalism.
Ryan Stephens	I‚Äôm very conservative but love Jimmy Dore. Peace!!!
R Schindeler	The Deep State is trying to use the death of the journalist to destabilize the global economies.  https://youtu.be/gbKbGZ4K0CQ
Jo Hickey	@jimmydoreshow tell him to keep a little grey at the temples, makes him look distinguished and adds more gravitas
StealieSteve	I read Siemens won't be attending the Davos in the desert today in Saudi Arabia because of this journalist murder and Germany will stop selling arms to the Saudi's. This of course will only be a temporary pause and once this dies down its back to business as usual with the Saudi'süëπ
connor nimmo	Why is the establishment backed MSM giving this Khashoggi scandal so much coverage? It puts us at odds with the country that imports 13% of our oil and whom we have a major weapons deal with. No one is talking about how strange this is.
Luther Dean	the USA: WE NEED MORE GUN BOMB MILITARY PROTECT YOU FROM BAD SCARY OTHER and so corporations have the freedom to put poision in our childrens food and water, lock people up in cages for profit, and make lots of money off sickness and death- military industrial complex
J-Man	Well said Jimmy and Miserable Liberal as well as your Guest
Palikaroui	I bet you all any money that if Syria was to bomb a school bus full of children they (Pompeo & Trump) would of bomb Syria straight away, without a second thought. Double standards here for the money. This people will *fuck* their mother for money and I am declaring them like I declared W. Bush, Tony Blair &  Henry Kissinger WAR CRIMINALS (directly or indirectly) makes no difference.
D Personal	JIMMY SUPPORTS DEMOCRATS!  He talks out of both sides of his mouth.  Vote Green OR form another party.

Dereksdyna96	who's doing this redish blonde anyway..
Amadeus	This is why I scoff at Pacifists. No amount of civil disobedience ever stopped Genocide. NONE.
Jessica Wylde	Khashoggi is a long time CIA asset so the US feels betrayed, we don't care about Yemen or journalists...

matteo hellard	didn't trump say we should take the minerals from afghanistan?
yumpladukfoo	Jimmy....we all know this. Who are you talking to? Do you really think there are fringe viewers here?
Kuma San	T.G. 2020!
J Snow	Gabbard/Sanders 2020!!!
Gem Girlla	Thank you Jimmy for continuing to speak out against these nonstop wars for profits.  It was you who educated me about what was really going on in Syria years ago.  On the subject of Bernie, it is as dangerous for people to worship him as is it Trump supporters to should worship Trump.  Standing by principles and issues is what is crucial and won't fail.   Making a politician a demagogue will.  Its time for the all of us to come together and form an antiwar movement.  We can't wait for a politician to do this.  They won't.
Marlyn	US assists Saudi Arabia in the selection of TARGETS in YEMEN including that bus load of children, so USA is also responsible for this tragedy.
History Eraser Button	I have been seeing a bunch of Army commercials. They are ramping up recruitment of the peasants to send them off to kill and die for profit.
Robert Simon	You have to be borderline psychotic to want anything to do with D.C.  today.
liagog	tulsi gabbard will be a great 1st woman president of "merika", lol but i hope she wait's till 2024....  the dems need that time to find their liberalness roots... 8 years of the donald followed by 8 years of tulsi.... Peace and Freedom 2018
Regi Cheney	Selective outrage
donald doyle	You tell the American people that your government is corrupt,  get rid of Trump he doesn't give shit about people being murdered by the Saudi government,  all he thinks of is money, and gold plated tables and furniture, he is a nut case of the worst kind
michael bell	It's one big sick fiddly and all the Stooges are in on it the ZDS GETS THE BANKSTERS TO PRINT PAPER THE HEAD CHOPPERS GIVE THERE OIL FOR IT SO THE FIDDLY GOES ON Britain France Germany are in it all the western governments are in it and lets not forget the head choppers are up Israel so they can do no wrong And the head of the boil Trump just says what the fools all think we are coining and that's all that matters And what makes even Dafter America prints the money the head choppers pay for the wepones
Stan Dalby	Jimmys right , Bernie showed his true colours when he caved in for Hitlery , the whole world knows that Bernie won the Demotwat nominee & he bowed down to hier Hitlery
Nicholas Page	Of course it's all about the money. Fake pro-life Christians like Pat Robertson encourage it by excusing the murder of one person so as not to complicate the murder of thousands more by American-made weapons. Just like the Founders and Jesus would have wanted.
Reality Revolution	money money money despicable
Samuel Untermeyer created Federal Reserve &Israel	Thanks Jimmy for always going further than the first childish level. Btw you and Tucker Carlson are surprisingly close in Middle East topic. The peace front is much larger than it appears. Israel insists to continue wars...
ORAINY1	please read ,ore about the war in Yemen ... its a proxy war with Iran .. they are the one who are responsible for all the chaos in that area .. a lot of evidents shows Iranian involvement in supporting the houthis of Yemen against Saudi Arabia
Tribacious Tee	Shout outs to Jimmy for doing his best to keep us all sane

Ralphy R	The real threat to America is the Democrats and Republicans Congress whatever the fuck you want to call them, and now the nuclear threat with Russia. I hate to sound racist but the white man is the creator and Destroyer of modern times. Dem's and Rep's together

phil greene	so, trumpublican, when it's time to torture you, kill u, cut u up in pieces, bomb or starve u, it's OK when money's involved.
blackearl7891	Come on Jimmy. You know the saying. One is a tragedy, thousands are a statistic
Lilly O	Noone is perfect...the most important thing Trump has done is draining the swamp saving children. But there is a lot more to be done in this corrupt world and let's see what happens after the midterms and...just imagine if Hillary won...scary stuff!
Bin Tipper	So where are all the anti-war rightwingers??
Jack Waslander√≥	MSM here in Europe in overdrive because of this  sa ‚Äújournalist‚Äù...not a word about the murderd Bulgarian journalist who exposed massive corruption in the EUssr.this world is so fucking corrupt.
skeptic365	Haha Jimmy... spot on! Just say it!!! Lmao
Fransisco Morales	Jimmy‚Äôs wtf face is priceless.
Michael Rodney Weddle	Saudi Arabia has Khashoggi but America has Seth Rich!
jodi newell	Side note, I love it when Nelly‚Äôs on! I love her music & her input. Just saying, all good things :)
The Young Turds	We have the weapons. They have the oil. That's a deal ! It's that simple libs !!
Tanya Kasim	Yep, there's more than one bad guy in the world. "Israel" has killed Palestinian journalists, too.
APE MAN	Evil Mafias  Run all governments  History of the world is the evidence
blue atlanta beats	when russia allegedly killed this russian journalist even before the british investigation our german government expelled russian diplomats and wanted sanctions,  but now saudi arabia killed a journalist and germany says we dont know what happend yet don't jump to conclusions, we have to wait till the investigation is over...  and i bet when it's over there won't come any sanctions, we didnt even stop selling our arms even tho our law doesnt allow to sell arms to countries that are in war edit: if you want completely free beats check my channel out :))
Keith Durant	Well either that or he is telling the Saudi's that if they want America to overthrow Iran they will have to offer to carry all the costs like they did for Syria.
Larry Schnake	120,000 missiles - end to end would that fill a football field...two...three?
long hair dont care	America loves Saudi money  Lol That won't change
Marko Kraguljac	Jimmy, if those 7 trillion dollars really went to the Middle East, it wouldnt still be a miserable war zone, without food, water and medicine. Lion's share of that money went right back into US, into contractors pockets and more trickle down bullshit, as usual. War is their loophole to fill private pockets (mostly in US) with taxpayers money, while destroying lives and killing poor people around the world. It's disgusting.
Bill H	Anyone still stuck in the fake left vs right paradigm is truly comatose.
Samuel Freakin' Adams	The thing about Donald Trump is that he always reads the stage directions out loud.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to challenge Saudi Arabia, they buy a lot of weapons from us.‚Äù  It‚Äôs sick but also refreshingly honest.
Brendon Maartens	Saudi Arabia is Washington's main Middle East Oil Complex factory. Management had office staff reshuffled. The "security" for all factories is the Military Industrial Complex / hit squad... so simple.
Al Demir	Bravo Jimmy, selling weapons is not much different than actually doing the killings.
Philippe Peltier	Without Arabia, there is no US empire. This guy knows it...
Dynomite Hackjob	Why let a genocide get in the way of a little payday?
Shan Ri Ha	The Americans stopped being the "Good" guy a long time ago Jimmy and the people of the world really wish Americans would change that because when America wants help in the  future they're going to be met with "I don't think so". Throw in what Americans are allowing their masters Zionist israel to do to Palestine and there's even hatred of the U.S these days.and I must say well deserved. Hey Jimmy America went into the Middle East unprovoked and the fact that the U.S has wasted 7 trillion dollars is your own bloody fault and I don't think you've got a leg to stand on to ask others to pay for it. Those Zionist scumbags are sure rubbing off on you murderous fucking Yanks and none of it is good.  Peace
info addict	That's what Trump said about the butchered journalist: It was stupid and foolish. Meaning, he doesn't care they cut him to pieces as long as they do it smartly and don't get caught. Business baby.
Got George	All politicians and bureaucrats are corrupt as hell. I can think of only two politicians in the whole country that aren‚Äôt absolute pieces of shit.
Chasing Vega	When's the kickoff to the war in Venezuela?  After the midterms here and the presidential election in Brazil?  Boeing and Raytheon getting early christmas bonuses?
Ballsnacks	"They're not upset with what Trump is doing, they're upset at what he is saying". This is exactly right, Jimmy. I've been calling this the "Blah-go" because it's exactly why Blago is in jail and rest of the corrupt assholes are free. Blago was just a DP (you might have to explain that acronym, Jimmy) who married into a politically connected family. They thought he understood when to shut up, and how to conduct "business", so they let him in the "club" and in on all the secrets, then he fucked up and they cut him loose. I'm not pro-Blago, just anti-hypocrite.
Osama Number5	American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. ‚Äî Henry A. Wallace, America‚Äôs 33rd vice president (1941-1945)

oldschoolman 144	Idiocracy, just can't make that stuff up, truth is strager than fiction.
Ragna Eyjad√≥ttir	I disagree that people are upset that he says it .. and not upset he does it. While saying it in such a blunt way certainly is on another level ... US involvement in Jemen has not been something that was accepted at all.  I read well over half a dozen articles here describing US weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and how problematic it is. Does it reach the broader population and its conscience? no .. i fear it does not, but it did not went under the radar - if you re interested in international politics.
