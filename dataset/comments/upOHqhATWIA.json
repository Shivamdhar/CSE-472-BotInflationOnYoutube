Then he walked off busy, playing and I said, I been there, so I know it's there. When I was there I saw God reach into the people's chest and take the old heart out; their old heart was right there beating in His hand, Eze. 36:26; I watch Him give them a new heart, a heart of Jesus.\n     -I said, the old heart is mean, ugly, and selfish, I could just see the curiousness on his face as he considered those he knew like that, including himself. Then I said, but the heart of Jesus, is loving, kind, passionate and really giving, just as I walked off to finish what I was doing, I could see him imagining the people he knew that was just like that. Then he said, moving off somewhere else, playing, how can I get a heart like Jesus? And I said, all you have to do is ask God, and He'll give you a heart like Jesus. Then I lead him to pray, where he, himself asked God to give him a heart like Jesus.\n\xa0\xa0\xa0-You see, God's Will is done when all who will love him, come, agree to release their birth upon corrupt hearts and ask for, and take in, upon all that's life, love and treasure for them, this heart of Jesus, born again.
