Kelly Giannini	At the 6:04 mark, Scott Morrison Fully acknowledges RITUAL ABUSE as a contributor to Child Abuse. This is Monumental and many thanks should go to Fiona Barnett who was instrumental in having her followers ask Scott Morrison, PM of Australia, to include the words, "ritual abuse" in his National Apology Speech to victims, survivors & families of Child Abuse. We did and he did as well. What a huge victory that will change the mental health field in Australia, now allowing Ritual Abuse to be a medically accepted act of child abuse. The US needs to follow suit!!
kieran franey	Stop with the crying you are crying because your mates are caught , no grand speeches action has to be taken and you have to take action and tell every Australian what happened and who did it.
Gia Love	I see so many tears that have been heard.  And need to be seen.
Sean White	‚ÄúRitual sexual abuse‚Äù. Ok let‚Äôs get a task force to root out what is left from the last several decades of predation.
eyeOOsee	FINALLY!!! THANK you! Now let's see those abused individuals have their say in the same venue as you just spoke. Let them NAME NAMES! And stand in their truth!  Let Fionna Barnett speak to you all, let Jay Parker speak to you all, let Cathy O'Brian speak to you all, let's have an ITNJ court session in your parliament.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Q2iVXW3iiIBwbIniWfVZA/videos   Let's have one in EVERY country! THIS MUST AND WILL END!! NO MORE CHILD TRAFFICKING, NO MORE SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE HIDING BEHIND "NATIONAL SECURITY", NO MORE MK ULTRA MIND CONTROL!!...... IT IS GOING TO STOP!!! WE DEMAND IT!! And while this is underway, ADDRESS THE HARM DONE TO CHILDREN FROM "FORCED VACCINES", TOO!!! Talk about CHILD ABUSE! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Freda Rounthwaite	You hypocrite!!! Let's see how many are arrested now. How many? 1, 2,  if any. Instead of the thousands that should be arrested, including people on this video!!!!! PEOPLE in gov't! How is child pornography legal???? I will wait and watch how long it takes you to start arresting people AND prosecuting them. I will probably be long dead before that happens. You didn't listen to Fiona Barnett, did You?? No, you just abused her some more. YOU HYPOCRITE!!! I will apologise to you when I see prisons full of PAEDOPHILES and PAEDOVORES!!!!!!!!  WWG1WGA!!!
louis lynge	Gillard is shitting herself! She is Alpha Lodge!
Cyd Simone	Investigate Kamloops before Phillip and Elizabeth die without answering for it! END ROYAL PRIVILEGES! No human being should be considered above the law. Vatican City too, the Pope is just a MAN, nothing more, fallible and capable of evil...no people shoudl live in such wealth at the expense of "commoners". 2018~Vincero!
Richard New Right	Gallows for the pedos.
Chorus Frog	Are they rounding up the OFFENDERS ?????   An apology is worthless without further action.....
Kathy Burrell	Is it true Prime Minister Morrison attends Hillsong church? Is it not true that this church is accused of participation in human trafficking SRA? Wasn't former Prime Minister Turnball mentioned for helping to expose these atrocities? Hasn't he indeed been accused of being a pedophile? PM Morrison lists the many actions that will be implemented to help the victims, but not once is imprisonment for sex crimes against children, or  execution for ritual murder of children even hinted at. This is a farce meant to defuse the growing movement for justice. Until these evil perpetrators are put away there will be no justice.
Kalina Masarz	Thank You Australia .Were is Kim Beazley ? Very interesting surname
Evelyn Daly	At the beginning, I was incensed at a mere apology, but I was sobbing for joy and justice by the end. Good on you Australia! Thank you for taking the lead. The US shall follow. May God bless Fiona Barnett and may she receive the recompense she is due, as with all survivors.
Titus	How many j.,e.,w,,.s were found to be involved?
berni oakes	Wake up USA it is ten times worse here. Sick evil people. Save the children. Execute the pedos.
Recce Rat	This is connected in a way with President Trump and the Q team, remember underneath is the 5 eyes helping spy on Trump, comms being taken out, and the declass of the info required to show that Auz, Uk, Canada etc were trying to stop Trump! Expect similar from the UK and Canada, whilst they try and negate the declass from coming out! A good start.  WWG1WGA

Baabaara FavaBeans	This is a break through.  The first of it's kind.  SRA will finally begin to be talked about around the world.  I'm glad this came from another country's PM first so that it will be heard.  Amazing that the veil is beginning to really being lifted.  One of the comments was that this PM is guilty too.  I'll have to do some research. He really is covering the topic in depth.  What a beginning.
Laboucane Dennis	Have all the children moved to New Zealand while the Royals are visiting
bigskyaz	Glad to hear that someone is trying to address this problem.
Kathy H	The speech was great, yet many in the audience themselves are the abusers! Let‚Äôs quit just talking and actually DO SOMETHING! Take Fiona Barnett for instance, she suffered abused far beyond ANYTHING imaginable!    Its still going on daily by those we watch on television, movies, churches,schools, politicians.... and the media!  It‚Äôs time to stand up for these children and force change to stop these evil creatures!  Pray for the children!
f g	How can grown men and women do these evil deeds to innocent children? Who are these monsters? These elites think they are so powerful and big but they are cowards, wicked, and debased;  God will expose these stupid and lowly people- He has said "those who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first." I quit church because it is under the world system- God does not need a building made with mans hands, God resides in the temple (soul) of man if he or she who humbles themselves before him. These pedofiles are weak and spineless pieces of refuse
Mic Land	England and America is next.

Damon Tutterow	‚ö°‚ö°
Eva Zigon	"To the whistleblowers we did not believe: Sorry." I sincerely hope this also means that the Australian government's total lack of protection of Julian Assange will now finally change and that they will finally stand up for this - one of their/our bravest and most brilliant citizens as well. It was, after all, Julian who helped reveal the Podesta e-mails to the world. Here's hoping that this apology will be  followed by swift and uncompromising action in cleaning this filth from our society.
plato smith	one of the survivors comments was `i will never get my day in court`, it speaks volumes that the vast majority not only seek, but need the one thing that was not forthcoming in this speech. JUSTICE, they want justice to be served. i fear it will be the one thing they do not get.  no amount of apologies, no amount of money, no amount of commitment to their well being can heal the wounds for they will not stem the ever present tide of abuse that is institutionalised in every country on this earth. they ache, we ache for this huge omission from this speech, JUSTICE. (GOVERNMENT IS AN INSTITUTION AND PAEDOPHILLIA IS RAMPANT THERE TOO). this seems more like a `safety valve` exercise.

WhereWeGo1We GoAll	This is a good start
Auttie B	The world is run by satanic psychotic peadophiles. We the people demand justice for these children. A special unit to jail these ass holes immediately. An apology is not enough, no where near enough. Death penalty now. This is all thanks to President Trump who is chasing down these peados. The rest of the world is merely catching up. How many of your parliament are guilty of this crime? 80% I guess. MR Prime Minister you are just passifying the people, no justice. Fuck your apology, it means nothing
M1st3r_Luna	I'm from the U.S. and it makes me so happy for you lovely people to have your PM acknowledge the horrors of all of these terrible crimes. I pray for you all.
TruthSearchUK	Time to rid the world of evil and follow it up with mass worldwide arrests.  Otherwise it's just dust in the wind.
Oliver Jahnel	Thank YOU Australia, I hope OUR "Representatives" are following YOU!!!
Michelle Burns	Thank you! We have to come together and fight this world wide. Our president Trump is fighting to eliminate this evil and Wickedness. Prayers
Teresa Bromaghim	RSA does NOT stand for Ritual sexual abuse! It is called Ritual SATANIC Abuse! We MUST call it what it IS, not white wash or sanitize it as a mere sexual perversion, but for the WICKED EVIL that encompasses what is going on in this world!!  No, this apology does not address nor expose the horrific reality of what survivors and victims have suffered!!!
Free speech for all	Bringing into the light what's been in the darkness, voiceless because those who should protect failed deliberately.  Victims and survivors God bless you all, help is coming.
A B	Its sad that world's elites and richest people on earth are the ones hes talking about. He is just letting the world know what they do. Open investigations for all and justice for all victims
Missy Caulk	May this be the first of many countries that stand up, recognize and put in accountability for our children. Repentance on behalf of a nation is a very powerful thing.
TimedPiecesTN	While I appreciate the *exposure* Imho, his emotions are a mask for the public..I seriously DOUBT he's sincere. This speech is far too clinical and it's just a "Sorry!" Like, "..yeah, we phucked your kids, phucked up your lives, we acknowledge it and so sorry bout that...oh and thanks for not lynching us..."!  These *CREATURES* know NO compassion, empathy, or love. It was all bred OUT of them long ago. That's how they can do what they do and NOT feel empathy or regret. Psycopaths CanNot be rehabbed.  ‚ù§ üò¢  These poor, innocent victims & survivors ..they suffer still.üò¢

Bruce Olivier	Round these basterds up then you will have the confidence of the people. Start tomorrow starting at the top of the government. No mercy for any of these evil pieces of human garbage.
David Hanson	Trump has been addressing this for quite awhile.   The MSM ignores this. They spend all their time hating on Pres. Trump and no time reporting on the great things he's done particularly addressing this. WWG1WGA Follow Q and take the red pill or stay ignorant.
Madelyn Anderson	Trump has spoken on this, and since day 1 has been going after this Evil in the US, with the Clintons & Others coming to Justice Soon! No other US President has gone after Destroying this evil in America like a Trump has! Way too many in America are Guilty of this Evil..Justice Is Coming for All!
C M	The world needs to see arrests, convictions,  executions,  of those involved in this, including the US,  the Catholic Church,  Great Britain, the world.  EXPOSE IT ALL.
Joenabel Garcia	Greatest apology I've even seen.  Hopefully there's plenty more from other parts of the world.
Truthification Chronicles	Amazing! It appears Australia has awakened. This is a huge red pill!! Words are a great start, but the important part is action that results in justice for these survivors. May God bless the plan by President Trump and the Q Team and may they find good success to end this type of horrible abuse of our world's children!
Claudia K	What about prosecutions?!
Cuppa Pg Tips	This is just the beginning...
kenndel Riconoscuito	What agreat speech. It touched my soul. As a survivor and not being believed..i think this was an amazing apology. God bless.

PottedJam	"a sorry" is NOT ENOUGH!!!  Action!!! not words....
White Raven	There is NO WAY this guy became Prime Minister of Australia without having knowledge of these atrocities. He could point to people seated in the chamber he is delivering this speech from who are guilty. This guy is coming clean and attempting to earn a measure of credit ahead of what he knows is coming. The stories of survivors are bad enough, but the network of organized ritual abusers at the very top of government, industry, and society leaves behind many, many more who didnt survive. No mention of the tens, if not hundreds of thousands who were ritually abused and murdered for the most evil of purposes. These people wont be investigated or punished....they ARE the investigators, and those who control them!
River J Brooks	Sorry? That's it? No prison!!üò°

Tony G	Don't think that the royal family will like you messing with their money making. Can't believe that the royal idiots will go along with this. Hope it's true. About time.
Damien Pol	I've been critical of Scott Morrison but my hat goes off to him.  This was very bold.  Of course, words must be backed by actions to mean anything but this is a very important first step.  I sincerely hope this isn't yet another token gesture for damage control before sweeping it under the rug once again.  This time feels different.

Time to stop and eradicate this cancer of the West and punish and bring down those institutions behind this most evil crime. People, YOU have the power to create a better world. It is YOUR responsibility to do so, not pass the buck to others, weaker and compromised in positions of " authority".  There is NO Jutice higher than Just Us.

Msunbird02	Just curious ... does anyone happen to know if this apology is a world first?
james powell	Apologies!!!!!!!!! I want arrests, and public hangings. Having said that, good on Australia for at least getting thus far. I ask why this is not being covered on The BBC? OK, not really, I know exactly why this is not being covered on The BBC.  The sexual abuse is bad enough, but it is only part of the story, and not even the most important part. One wonders what sort of horrible policies these compromised politicians  have enabled  over the many years this has been going on. Edward Heath gave the UK, The EU, and  deliberately lied while doing so. How many wars have been started? How many people died in these wars? How much tax payers treasure has been utterly wasted, which could have saved the lives of millions? How many injustices have been ignored or perpetrated? The implications of this are enormous X 1000.   For you can be absolutely assured beyond any doubt whatsoever, that The Australian Military Intelligence organisations, as well as all other Military Intelligence organisations knew, and have always known what ALL of these vile criminals have been up to. Now days, and for much longer then is generally known or recognized, MI, know more about the rich and powerful then they even know about themselves. They know this about you and me, as well, except in our cases, they don't give a fuck what we do, or think, because we have absolutely no power whatsoever. And guess what, we never ever have, had any power.  Only the truth can set you Free, knowledge is power. Which is why we know so close to nothing, it is truly terrifying.
James Weld	Torture for peados
lettertube	It is just a start. Justice is required around the globe.
G Marshall	An apology is all good and well but what are you going to do to STOP it completely. You elites in goverment speak words that have been heard before but very little action has been done against those evil doers. You stand there with words are you going to stand for all those children who have to bear a life time of shame and pain. And those children who could not make it through the evil deeds that were thrust against them. It will take more then words to redeem the evil against our precious gifts from GOD.  OUR CHILDREN!
Scott.	For years, every time this was addressed; all you ever heard was condemnation and accusations of ‚Äúsatanic-panic‚Äù and looks of incredulity. We know now, Satanic Ritual Abuse cannot be hidden away. To Quote one gentleman on this topic ‚Äú The One Crime Worse Than Treason‚Äù.

bbfreetube	Severe punishment for these predators or they will continue.  The punishment for bank robberies:Bank robberies usually have much longer, and more severe sentences than a house robbery, because a bank is federally owned, while a house or apartment is owned by an individual.  According to federalcharges.com (Bank Robbery + Laws, Charges & Statute of Limitations - Get Federal Criminal Lawyer Help), the punishments for bank robbery are as follows:  anyone who enters a building used as the whole of a bank or part of it with the intention to forcibly remove and steal money or commit a felony that will affect the bank will have a serious fine and up to 20 years in prison in cases where the robbery puts the lives of others, or if assault is committed, a more serious fine and up to 25 years in prison are possible. This includes threats made, and weapons used, even if they‚Äôre toys those who reveal, conceal, or accept anything taken from the bank can face up to 10 years in prison robberies including the death or abduction of someone could face much, much more serious punishment, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty-  that is for MONEY!  Severe to stop the criminal from robbing banks.  USA....Now, considering what has been done to these innocent children, what would end this crime?  Think it over carefully!
