underspon	LOVE
RyderGuy	This was my first Metallica concert and I remember hearing those first 3 notes and immediately recognizing what it was and literally screaming in excitement (as I did for about the first half of the show)
William Poire	I know their singles from this album were the most popular, but this was always my favorite. I remember just playing this song repeatedly while stargazing. And this was in the days of cassette tapes.   I hope they play it in Tulsa (if Lars is reading this!)
Frisch Regen	all of this was and will be
C21H30O2	that moustache always maked Hetfield sound better

Skippy Farnsworth	Thank you Metallica for letting us fans listen to your great music on YouTube. Some of us live in places where we will have a slim to none chance of ever seeing you guys in concert. I speak for many in saying thank you for sharing with us, your fans of your great music.

Fonzy Brookestone	Song jams!!! The fellas are sounding great! Anyone know what's up with James' picking hand? His guitar seems a bit higher too, maybe that's throwing off his picking? I think his guitar was raised from the REAL low stance due to his neck?
Macrov	I lost it when this started! An amazing show!!!!!!!

William Raymond	Came to the comments to see how much people had picked Lars‚Äô playing apart. Probably a lot as usual.

emiliano Gimenes j balvin	Metalica for ever üòéüî•üî•üî•‚ù§üé∂
Giovanni Coscia	A big wave of rock
Matt Bird	See Lars plays those triplet fills at the beginning awesome. All he would need to do is try just a little harder on One and Moth and he'd be amazing. I find him lacking and cutting corners on some things. It's like bro you're Lars Ulrich believe in yourself and if you fuck up just say "Van Halen" like Dime and Vinnie would say.

Albert Stinnett	See in March at Sprint center
Temmy9	i mean, Its nice to have premieres its just that its a short video but still a great way to hype it up!
Dejoblue	I have started ignoring Metallica's notifications because they are now premiers I cannot watch. It is annoying, overtly commercial, inconvenient, time wasting, bandwidth wasting, and sabotages legitimate notifications.
Lord Kurt	Let's hope Metallica will surprise us by playing Mama Said, Free Speech for the Dumb, The More I See, Ronnie Rising Medley, Beyond Magnetic "complete", Astronomy, Ramones all covers and Motorhead all covers, sometime
maverator	So I click on this but I can't watch it because it's not going to be live for another 91 minutes? I turned off my notifications for a reason, and this basically amounts to an advertisement cluttering up my subscription page. Especially when there are lots of other "premieres" in there too, which I also can't watch. Best case,  I can pick them up in the middle, which is not how I want to be watching these things. So I think this feature is garbage, and I encourage this channel to not do premieres. I am casually subscribed because I'm a big fan and I like to watch these videos occasionally. But I'm not religious about it and this is the kind of thing that pushes me away.
