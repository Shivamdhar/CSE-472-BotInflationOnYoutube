When there’s emphasis on everything, there’s emphasis on nothing. We need the subtle beats and instruments that don’t stand out, and are just barely there. Like if you agree. And if you don’t, feel free to express why. Just make sure you have a viable opinion other than ‘it’s the best! You don’t know what you’re talking about!’. We need more people like Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Backstreet Boys, etc. BRING EM BACK!!!\n\nP.S.\nYes, Justin Bieber DOES have a good voice, and yes he IS talented. It’s only within the last decade that he’s been starting to slip, as is what happens with EVERY OTHER ARTIST IN HISTORY. I honestly don’t know why he started getting so much hate in the first place, but you all need to stop it. Actually LISTEN and ANALYZE what you’re hating, before you start hating it.
