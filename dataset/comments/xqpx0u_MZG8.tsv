Adam Brough	Hartly: "bunch of fucking amateurs". How can he call anyone an amateur?
Don't light your own cigarettes.	So many children who didn’t get the Bad Boys reference. Also, y’all mad a big star isn’t your friend or what? He was congratulating Lewis for winning the championship... lmao
Obito Uchiha	Hartley calling people amatures lol
Foley48	For a guy who just won the world championship he doesnt even sound that happy? Probably sulking about not winning the race.
everyday life	Could've said something better for his 5th title
j4ck	I'm actually going to miss Alonso, he's an absolutely amazing driver with arguably the best race craft on the grid, he'll always be in our F1 hearts.
Santhosh Prabhu	Who else finds Hamilton annoying?
Mr. Sparkly Pants	Man. Fernando sounded very sad
Matteo Moretti	Come si fa a dire a un pilota di rallentare perche fa il miglior tempo dio can è per questo che vanno tutti a vedere la moto gp
Максим Худяков	Why they always say “Copy that”, “I save it”? What does it mean?
ericsbuds	I had a feeling Daniel's car was gonna break down. Wish it hadn't :(
Péter Nagy-Miklós	The background music is unusually good here. Most of the time I find no joy in F1 video background tracks in this channel, to be fair.
wouter haaksma	MAX VERSTAPPEN!!!
KurkkuMopo	You realy take Will smith voice-over to this?  Cring :Dddddd
Phillip Muchiri	Brendon Hartley calling other drivers Amateurs is the funniest thing I've heard today,,  Will Smith clearly did not watch Verstappen's drive,, no wonder the guy he taught how to drive was 4 seconds from being  lapped,,
Me Me	Glory thief that's or will smith is,he still thinks he is the prince of bell end,I mean bell air
The Gamers Channel	Daniel Riccardo did a great job  I'm saying as an Australian

Chang Freddy	Now I hate Will
Patrick Nancanha Seidi	Max going too fast again 😂😂😂
wert freund	What the f*ck happened to Ricciardos Renault engine!?  I want Charly Whiting to investigate on data!  Secondly where is Ocon driving F1 next year it got to be in F1's, Liberty's and Chase Careys natural interest to keep such an excellent driver in the series who outrode his teammate Perez A L L SEASON, although Perez hounded him badly several times without any real consequences!  Is that the message F1 want's to send out to all the Young viewers drive fair and ambicious and get kicked out of the sereies, cause the guy who drove unfair to You => teammate most of the time kept his seat!?  ..really!!!?
ZER0 DR	Just turn it down please Max please

RRoJ	Man Alonso don't deserve to leave F1 like that
Amin Hafdaoui	Fernando was crying...
JM	Liberty Media has such a hard on for celebrities. Europeans don't go that mad for celebs, thats why we don't have half time shows during football matches.
Charles HD	I hope that Vettel win the championchip in the next year
shivam chaudhary	Lol Hartly calling other drivers amateurs theb what's he ?
Vectro666	This is officialy the most anticlimatic championship in the history of F1, with LM trying to be funny at the cost of emotion and pure reaction.  Why the cringy team radio? This isnt a fucking kids show! Grow up LM and give us what we want!
Martin Horvatić	So arrogant from Hartley!
Hauptsache Puls	Every Mercedes official and Hamilton himself did not sound happy like they should in a title winning moment. One bad race stands out more than a title. Just impressive! Ferrari and Red Bull should be aware for next season!
BrettJones27	What the hell is Will Smith doing here.... FFS! A down vote just for the shameless, pointless insertion of a hollywood star when he has nothing to do with the race or hamilton's success. Just utter crap!
Kyle Parkins	You can hear the sorrow in both Alonso and his engineer’s voices when he is told to stop the car.
A or Ta	The race where Lewis almost got lap'd by Verstappen ;)
Nico RosbergFan	I wonder why they didn't pit Fernando
Κωνσταντινος Μωραιτης	Woaaa.Wait a minute...Did Hartley just say what a fucking bunch of amateurs?Hartley?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Jones	i love Best Of Team Radio
The Old Fart	Come guys..you missed some Epic radio  "Ok, that's a decent cushion, so let's match laps times with the cars behind" - "Was that ok?" "Yeah Hamilton lap time 21.8" _ "What was  i doing?" "21.6"   "how does it feel?" - "slow"
nes suno	Ruined by you American Liberty Media clowns with that 1 race old Will Smith recording. PROMOTE TRUE FANS AND FUTURE RACERS not these hollow and shallow VIPs.
M3nt2 R3pr3z3nt	'That's how you supposed to drive', to a man coming in fourth... xD Verstappenn is a beast! MORE! #forzakubica
Flamecrest	"That's how you do it, baby! Just like I taught you!" - Will Smith (never professionally driven a race car) to Lewis Hamilton (5 times F1 World Champion)  Cringy as fuck
JC Whats	I like that American sauce  over the Formula 1, just like everything they take what isn't there's and put that F#ck yeah USA USA USA over it, stupid fresh prince and so on....
H.I 21	Please upload in 4K!!
Kaito	engineers will always says "copy that"

Vadim Kropotin	nice music
Nihar Bendre	Hartley calling the guybin front an "Amateur" 😂 GG
Daniel Matthiesen	Love listening to Hartley getting fired up
deathmetalshredify	I understand having Will Smith as a backup for the sport is advertising it. What he said was incredibly cringy though...
Adam Janik	"slow down max".. Nice to see how f1 turned over last few years. From being fastest on the track to being most effective with tires and fuel. Just put diesel in it those have some nice MPGs.
Unpanda Rouge	Lewis doesn’t heard Will Smith anytime...
Santo72	Alonso P1?? wot
THE NOTORIUS SAL	Hartley is ridicolus
Raiez njr	Daniel can't wait to get out of that Redbull once and for all..

Doodlebug YT	Great job Lewis! Your now considered one of the greats. I like Sebastian, but still... amazing job on being a 5 time world champion! 🏆🏆🏆🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
jianh1989	Dear Liberty, that thing with Will Smith, stop it.
moddok	im so sorry for daniel :(
cocabeer	That Will Smith thing was aweful. "Just like I taught you"? Is this guy nuts? And Lewis drove like shit last Sunday, so it's double messed up.
Jenny Gavin-Wear	Never heard Lewis sounding so tired after a race.
Jack Bauer	GTFO with celebrity pre-recorded messages. No one buys the bullshit that it's live and that they actually love the sport.
Alexander King	Hartley to stay in Toro Rosso please...
Thomas Ning	So does anyone know why alonso had to retire the car?
Aykut	Did Lewis not know it was Will Smith or was he just not thrilled for being P4, why no reply
WiseGuy02	The message from Will Smith was the most cringeworthy thing I've heard over the radio.
Gustavo Santos da Silva	Ahhhh those where some great battles. Michae Schumacher, Mika Hakkinen and Will Smith. Best drivers of a generation.
GloomGaiGar	Hartley going full savage. Meanwhile Gasly starts from P20 & finishes P10.
mini696	Who thought it was a good idea to get Will Smith on the mic?
Roland Lee	Soo... Will Smith taught Lewis how to drive? And he is supposed to finish 4th? wtf... pure cringe...
Sofyan Nanda Fahrurrozi	"P1, purple in every sector" 🤣🤣
kickinbackinOC	Will Smith...Pure shmaltz.  Lewis is a hero to me, maybe the only one I have. But Will Smith is nothing to me...sucked to hear his voice just then. Like Will had a shred to do with anything.
potato911	Alonso and Ricciardo, two of the better drivers that don't deserve what's coming to them.
General Almirante Presidente Aladeen	Hartley saying amateurs that's funny
Mao A	I'm a Will Smith fan but ugh that was embarrassing. It seemed so out of place.
pritam cv12	It would have been really nice if Lewis Hamilton had mentioned Ron Dennis atleast in some part of his speech. He and his father worked tremendously for their dream.  But Ron Dennis deserves atleast a thanks for his company's funding.
george langan	No wonder Riccardo's leaving Red Bull. It won't even be a downgrade if his car manages to actually finish a fucking race
Adam A	Wtf with the will smith message? Why? Soo annoying and embarassing. Does he need air time that badly? Argh, I'm offended
Armchair Racer	Will Smith - 5 times world champion driver coach, apparently

Nicholas David Hutabarat	WILL SMITH *CHEQUERED FLAG*

Sebastien Tuscano	hartleys message lmfao
Imran Nadal_ CR7_Khyber Pakhtunkhwa	some stupid people are copying each other by saying will smith sounded "cringy"! not at all, i loved it! i think they dont undertand afro-american humour!
Robert M	People saying that the Will Smith pre-recorded message telling Lewis he taught him how to drive is acceptable because it's a movie reference are being ridiculous.  What next?  At the end of Will Smith's next movie, we get 30 seconds of random footage of Lewis Hamilton driving?  That's the level of irrelevance we're talking about here.
nismo007	WIll Smith giving driving advice is like him giving marriage advice. OH WAIT!
Antonio Gallagher	Ricciardo, Alonso, Hartley = cursed
DugBingo951	Really calm radio messages.
Oyi 87	Will Smith has no business doing that radio comment...He ruined the moment
Santi BD	missing a radio team: "boah, better than 4th position."
Suresh Kumar	I'm wondering where would Hamilton be without Will Smith..... He taught Hamilton everything...... What a DOUCHEBAG....
Zlatan ibrahimović	At first i thought it was jeff gordon that was talking to lewis because jeff was a special guest at the mercedes garage. I thought to myself while the radio message was played "daamn jeff gordon must be a hardcore lewis hamilton fanboy because he want to sound like a black man so bad" hahaha
beetle juice	Hartley is one annoying cry-baby
Just Simon	Poor Alonso, sad to see him leave the race right at the start..
Hugo Seelen	@2:19 "That was purple in sector 2 and 3"
Carlitox b	2:17 my new favorite driver hahaha thats how a champion thinks

Erik Coronel	Ricciardo 😣
SilverRonald	Which team does this "Will Smith" drive for?
Ivan Plis	Raikkonen was napping all race long, how the fuck did he finished on the podium? Typical Kimi race weekend
james manson	29 comments down to find any mention of the WDC. You guys salty as fuck 😂
Andy Lee	Max's engineer pleading for him to slow down. Classic.
DaylightDigital	Bad Boys?
tarksable	Just because Will Smith is a gun at F1 2011 and the two time champion gives him no reason to say that
David Pyles	Um...Will Smith was the "Worst of Team Radio." So silly and contrived.
yz249	Hamilton: nearly gets lapped Will : NoW tHaTs hOw yOu DrIvE
Ryan Fong	alonso cant give a shit at this point
Insane Racer	It's funny how they tell Ricciardo and Alonso how to go to P0 when they have so much experience doing it. I feel sorry for them both
William Stephens	Who was Max's fellow dutchy on the podium?
GhaV jGRite (jeaHAvee)	I know you don't hear this very often so we are P1 purple and every sector.
SennaRossiFan46	You have to feel sorry for that poor guy Ricciardo
Rude Boi	Liberty F1 fans do not care for celebrities, it is cringey.
Justice Warrior	Ohhhh yes Will Smith really taught Hamilton how to drive... What a joke.. Cringe level is insane!! Why does Will still speak Wakandian when it doesn't make any sense and it's stupid...
Luke Wallace	Hearing Danny like that was gut wrenching. I really do feel for the guy.
PhantomUniform0	Great race, also whats the music in this
AlectriczOfficial	Brendon Hartley is getting furious about amateurs, but he is still one of them. It's his first season... so he.. offended himself? hmm
ramesh anand	Ok Mercedes the YouTube comments have spoken. Keep will smith off team radio.
Subi_fan	That Will Smith part was pure cringe.
Zaac Spencer	What race was will watching?
allawee1991	Looks like Will Smith doesn't know shit about the sport.. That's was one of Hamilton's worst GP!
Adam Advocaat	Well I guess we can all agree that Will Smith isn't a racing driver.  Probably better off just getting jiggy wit it.
Casper Due Hansen	Disappointed with this one... Where was all the Hamilton crying? About losing a second a lap, been given the wrong tyres and what not 😂
Elroy lobo	Hamilton not a worthy Champ.....great wat he has achieved but dude come on your team mate has to slow down  twice in one race.... Instead you driving Give Toto to drive and you claim the points..... F@#£in  joke
Ricardo Bespalhuk	Leave Max alone. He just want have the taste of having a great engine and going purple in all sectors!
thebanhammer1	Will Smith was cringe as hell. Get it through your skull Liberty, nobody wanted it.
ER BE	XDD’
Fr35HPR1NC3	8 DNF for Daniel this year and almost all due to mechanical failure....Get away from that toxic team and get to one who isnt going to sabbotage your chances!! Makes me sick....Redbull always seem to give him the less reliable car in 2018 >:|
Mister Conan	1:15 ,  was Alonso crying??
Hugo Stiglitz	Will Smith is such an annoying cunt
Khin David	I feel for daniel riccardo. The guy just cant catch a break
DJ AidonYG	What happened to Fernando?
Rasta Man	Me : Hi  2:33 Ok
Mansch007	Who's that Smith guy? Never seen him in any competitive racing.
Denis Kudlik	That Will Smith fake radio message is among the top 5 worst things my ears have ever been exposed to.

Martijn Vv	Team radio's are now recorded in a bathroom ??
Simon der Weduwen	Wait should we rewind a bit Alonso:”I did Some donut practice for next year” 😂😂
VANITY80	Jesus Will Smith is so cringeworthy 😷
my name	Why all the censored messages? Fuckin idiots.
Kevin Papenburg	This weekend had everything. Happiness, relief, but also salt, arrogance, cringe, heartbreak, frustration. Really enjoyed it. Did I mention cringe?
pls team	an almost lapped car just got 4th
Pedro Silva	Next year im cheering for Vettel just to hear the message recorded by David Hasselhoff
Benjamin Puljak	hartley calling others amatuers lmao
Psyclone The Seahawk	Brendon Hartley calling people amateurs. Yeeeaaaaah...
MUZZAMMIL BOLTMAN	Apparently Will Smith taught Lewis how to 'coaster' an F1 car till the end
machine bomb	will 'cringe shit' smith..
BWOAH	'That's how you supposed to drive' So you're supposed to finish in P4, 78 seconds off the lead   Interesting
Schadows77	Silly Verstappen ... he should know by now a F1 is not meant to make purple sectors and attacking. It's made so you can look after your tires, look after your engine, look after your gas consumption, all while making sure you're not surprised by those guys running in F1.5 on the same track as you.
Harold2018	Im confused when Dan was out Max was saying on the radio turn down the engine so why is he doing purple sectors on lap 65?
Ali Aljoubory	How come I didn't hear Hamilton's team radio at the end of the race? I just heard Will Smith?!
Manuel alaminos dominguez	Heart breaking listening to Alonso and Ricciardo. They were both sould broken.
Pratyush Kamboj	You didn't often see the engineer swearing
Karpia	0:25 xDDDDDDDDDD
MIAthe305	Lol take it easy Hartley, you’re gone in 3 races so how about you serve yourself a slice of humble pie
Alen Ozim	Hartley is talking about amateurs but he is an amateur lol
Andrew Small	The cheesy American style will smith audio was awful... STFU
Миша Сушков	1:18 SO SAAAADDD((((((
Nikhil Menon	It would have been great to hear someone from Lewis' family congratulate him on the title at the chequered flag. Instead.. will smith! Cringe!
Baran Yavuz	Respect Lewis.
MrSgtScotti	Will Smith needs a off switch.
SuperMechguy	Red Bull messing with Ricc
Savannah M3	Damn. I didn't know Will Smith was a world champion and taught Lewis?!? That's the perfect idea for a documentary about Lewis. Sitting in a class while Will Smith is teaching him how to drive.
Mik Davies	I could not see the point of the 'Will Smith' voice-over, totally unnecessary, totally cringeworthy, typical American, must get involved at all costs, rhetoric!
denmark39	I hate celebrities
Liam Savinainen	1st time alonso doesnt get mad over p-0
Cp Gautam	pretty sure ric is screaming just as loudly as in quali, after the race
kbst84	In 25 years of watching F1 there are only two drivers I would consider myself a real fan of. Senna and for whatever reason...Brendon Hartley. I want him to stay so badly in F1. And I'm not from New Zealand...not even close.
Duckingtanker	Hartley talking a lot about people with confirmed seats next year...
Grin Wakiin	What is P-1 then P0 ?
The Marauder	Why didn't they just pit Alonso and remove the carbon from Ocon's car instead or retiring? Also, Hartley.....really man, you're also a rookie. Just because you got a seat with Toro Rosso, it doesn't make you hot shit on the track as you're mediocre at best.
tommobeast2	Hang on a minute when did Will Smith ever teach Lewis Hamilton to drive
Simracingnoob	What was that echo on some of the radio messages
Max 33	1.ham 2.verstappen 3.alonso 4.ricciardo 5.vettel 6. Leclerc 7.ocon 8.hulkenberg 9.perez 10.gasly 11. Sainz  12.bottas 13.grosjean 14.kimi 15. Mag 16. Hartley 17. Ericsson 18.stroll 19.sirotkin 20. Van Thoughts?
AVP •	Will Smith wasn't even part of the race, the most stupid radio message F1
Lucky Luke	Vettel should hire Will Smith to coach him how to drive.
Sharmik Thakar	C R I N G E  S M I T H
TheFikri136	I know Will Smith spoke in radio. But his name in 3:07 ? .. Honestly, wtf is going on?
michael williams	Ricciardo having terrible luck along with alonso lately cant get passed the 1st lap without someone crashing into him or hitting debris.
Mr Rayquaza boi	What is the background music?
blackAngel	"That's how you supposed to drive!" ~15 seconds from being lapped, xD. But I agree, so maybe next year Vettel gets the Title.  "We don't need it, but it's nice." It is indeed!  Now to more serious stuff: What happened to Alonso? was there still a bit of wing stuck in a crucial place? And Ricciardo? Engine failure?
Cbr 3	sees thumbnail, dislikes
Andika Tansir	Vettel  In 2017 : Mamma mia .... 2018 : Well done.
Teoxx	3:22 to skip Will Smith's message
KleiberFan	Complaining about Will Smith cringe is not a substitute for a meaningful contribution to the comments section
Mauricio Bastazini	Please dont let celebrities who dont understand shit about the sport speak on the radio. Now we gonna have to listen to fucking Will Smith every time we rewatch lewis being 5 times world champion. "thats how you drive" *probably Lewis worst race this season*
Elliott Wardle	That’s how you supposed to drive!.... to p4 and 60 seconds off the lead 😂😂
Joe Molineaux	Lewis is boring af
Βασίλης Δημούσης	Hartley talks about amateurs. What a joke
Lyionis	This race was really similar to the race in 2017. Max wins after great start and is slowed down by the team at the end. Ricciardo, after good race, retire with car problem. Hamilton has problem during almost whole race and wins championship arriving at further place.
Angga Pratama	the HungarianGP curse has been broken!
Pedro Delgado	2 Things: A: Where Is The Radio Of Sainz's Car Issue? B: Is Brendon Hartley Getting Fired From F1 And Moving To Indycar Next Year? I Want Artem Markelov With A Seat In F1.
Kandarp Vyas	Well background music is just dope . Anyone knows it please reply.
Craig Hamilton	5 TIME WORLD CHAMP!!! Congrats my brother!!! Woo!
TheIVY321	Really glad you had the exchange between Lewis and Bono, the Will Smith attempt at comedy was completely out of place.
El Chaval Duro	Will Smith is starting to piss a lot of people off. The older he gets, the nuttier he becomes. Motherfucking nigga says, thats how you drive. If Lewis drove like that the whole season he'd be below even Verstappen in the drivers standing.
capitao rex	Poor Riccardo .-
alessandro lagi	Hartley has to be penalized that it’s not the language that he can use to talk about Giovinazzi!!
Matías Tadeo Rossi	What does p1 and p0 mean in these contexts?
Lucas Gomes,Tamba	WILL SMITH!!!?
Tongankakarot 66	Fuck red bull
Klenex	why is brendon hartley calling giovanazzi amateur so is he
RED Productions	I don’t know why you guys callin will smith cringy.. it’s a bad boys reference.. he a baller regardless he can say what he wants. 🤪
Jens Plöntzke	Ricciardo‘s race engineer was so unenthusiastic about P1 in Qualifying because he knew his car wouldn‘t make the entire distance anyway. So sad though.
Maketsu	Just here to tell that the pre-recorded Will Smith radio message was one of the cringiest thing ever. The post-race interviews come close though. Come on, Liberty. You're trying _way_ too hard.
D R	obviously  RBR test some parts on ric car, same was with webber 2013 when vettel broke all records,  we are not blind and stupid
Carpy Fernandes	Will smith wtf is he thinking
Sergi Monserrat Mascaró	Hartley: "bunch of amateurs"  The irony.
FRFM00	Hey Daniel its hard to win races without having a safety car and fresh tyres eh? yeh get it girl get it get it, fckin loser. you couldn't even beat Wickens
mufc gamer	Hartley very angry atm signs that he knows he been given boot
Timi Akinlonu	Ricciardo sounded like he was gonna cry. Man I can feel the pain he's going through
Kevin Parks	Poor poor Daniel, I would be so fucking mad at my team
Rob Finney	Will Smith pre-recorded message - C'mon Liberty? What the hell? That was about the stupidest thing you could have done.
Rocco Cingolani	Biased championship. 5 races with an irregular solution for Mercedes
I Don't Know	A random question, but what’s a pre-start?
Csaba H.	HAM was great this year but will smith was a joke. a prerecorded crap. "Just how I taught you"....dumbass.
Zoa Khiangte	There’s a conspiracy against Daniel. Eighth DNF of the season. It’s a fucking joke.
pc_da_ one_84	Hartley: ********* bunch of amateurs!    Ricciardo; No u
Wole Oyeyele	Is it me, or the reliability of the RB14's engines are Red Bull's fault? I mean I know they're Renault engines, but Renault and McLaren almost never have the issues that Red Bull is having. The engines of the Renault and McLaren seem pretty damn solid and never blows up like on Ricciardo's car and never behaves in such a weird manner like on Verstappen's car. I think that's no coincidence, and Red Bull push the engines to destruction and want to extract every drop of performance without giving a damn about reliability. That's not how to use an engine. IMO, if they treat the Honda engine the same way, it's going to be just as unreliable.
M Q	wwg1wga
Billy Bollox	YAWN
OdySey PyRo	You don’t simply tell Verstappen to slow down
Ночной Позор	Alonso's breath says everything.
Sir_Flankalot	I honestly feel soooooooo freakin bad for Alonso man... that guy is just in the eye of a storm right now... everything is looking okay and all of a sudden boom... either engine, either another driver..*cough cough* Stroll in USA, or some other thing...  Next year without him will be so strange
AMG	On what Verstappen said- he is a proper racing driver!
tycoon	I hit the front wing from ocOn :D :D fernando's killing me with his accent everytime
Daniel G.	So ocon was able to pit on lap 1 for front wing damage, why wasn’t Alonso allowed?
Shoxy	Last season when Max was having all the issues Ricciardo said "maybe he's too hard on his car" and everyone jumped on Max for it.   Why is nobody saying that maybe Daniel is too hard on his car this year? Because it was taken as the reason when Max was doing all the retiring...
Han Solo	Thank you Liberty Media for putting on Will Smith... Trying to make F1 more 'American"? That Will Smith thing was so disrespectfull to Lewis and also to F1 in general. Why put Will Smith on the radio? Man o man. Why??????? And also what an arrogant and disrespectfull cunt Will Smith is. It is a shame for F1 that this happened. Never do this again!!!!!
Nicolai Kystaubayev	0:32 vs 1:48
all_is_bball	Lap 61 so sad :(
coaster323	ironic how hartley is calling amateurs to other driver
Atje	Will Smith: 'That's NOT how you supposed to drive'!!!!!
Blaise Hope	Driver of the day goes to Will Smith
HojozVideos	Ricciardo's reaction on Sunday sums up mine
TTTMusic	Whats up with the mercedes radio sound? They talking in a tin can?
J W	it's strange: during the race Lewis audio quality seems to be veeery bad - as a non native speaker you I cant barely understand anything. But when he celebrates suddenly it's loud and clear :>)
Burak Uğur Cantekin	Frustration in the sound of Alonso :(
Dean Campbell	That dude complaining about his tyre life the whole race and you said "thats how you drive?" Look Will i know you are now kinda popular in Youtube because of your helicopter jumping, but man... cringe has a limit
F1 fan	Poor danniel and Carlos always bad luck to them
Mohar Ikram	Still weird why Hamilton radios on his tyres are not here.... "These tyres are dead man!"
Jesús Zarate	*Checo noo!!! :C*
Elviūga	Thank god we didn't hear another "Get in there Lewis!"
VIEIRA!	ricciardo situation broke my heart
Steven Cohen	Hamiltons grandfather would have been proud to see him take the championship, as for vettel I heard that he had family problems and it made him spin round 3 times In 3 races, Ricardo dark cloud won't leave him alone, and Alonso I have an idea but rather not comment
Marko Zivanovic	The Will Smith pre-recorded message was pure CRINGE!
mohand prince	Max yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa     Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
Martin Zlatev	Any one that heard a Big Smoke on the radio?
Phet Suwankhajorn	"OHHH MAN" from Ricciardo broke my heart.

/Høwłıtə/ /JackTheEmerald/	"I'll save it" Fuck you RBR
ΛΝDΗΣΣ	if hamilton supposed to drive the whole season like today, he will not be world champion.... will smith blo'on banget
RcNumbers Mr.Crash-a-lot	No-one is even mentioning the fact that stoffel was complaining about people driving with slow pace in front of him? Were talking about the trash mclaren here
Sven Netherlands	Don't do that Will Smith thing anymore. It's fake. They like this kind of fake stuff in the USA. Keep it there (IndyCar, etc) but not in F1.
hornetluca	Who knew that _Will Smith_ taught _Lewis_  to drive
ShenkieJ	Fuck off with the pre recorded celebrity shit Liberty. We want to hear the engineers etc, don't Americanize F1!
Sergio Ferreiro Oroña	1:03 😢😢😢
Lightening McQueen	I never even realised that Will Smith was there and talked on the Mercedes team radio!
Attila Kovács	Cringe Smith

Meka Vijay	Brendon Hartley ..talking about amateurs..😂😂😂
Nina Van Wijk	Fernand deserves so much better too..
Country Music Hall of Famer	Man, there's a bunch of miserable fuckers who watch this sport. People whinging on the qualifying video because of a child dancing in the grandstand, people whinging on this one because of the Will Smith audio, not to mention all the other trivial stuff they've whinged about this year.
Donyx	"That's how you supposed to drive" Am I the only one who has heard "That's how you smoke the drug"?

Ich will be happy if he retire soon so maybe more exciting drivers(Max Verstrtuffen) will go to Merecdes unt give us ppl more fun!!  so if u see this Hamilton please go to Le Mans or Naskar where other boring drivers are.
Dani	That reaction from daniel when he got pole. He was so so happy. And then his engine leaves him. My heart is so broken. His reaction from pole got so many feelings in it..
Snowman11	Nando really sounds sad, and then hearing Danny after that as well
Firemarioflower	Sirotkin was a proper asshole this weekend.....   ignoring blue flags for Vettel as well.....   stupid turd.  Williams must get two new drivers next year.

Ali Taimoor	"Ok P-0 " That breaks my heart to hear Alonso saying it that way. His last year in F1 and he tried his best with a much slower car💔

Kiwi_91	anyone giving Hartley shit for calling them "amateurs" need to be aware hes much older, raced in other categories and is a 2 time WEC champion. So he knows basic race-craft
TheNostr4	hey F1 ,please no Hollywood shit here.PLEASE!!!i like will smith as a Actor in film u know...
Matt Birkett	I know that F1 read these comments, so please note that clearly, NO ONE liked the Will Smith message. Never repeat this tacky sort of thing again, please.
Khristian Gillespie	That was just epic.
242turbo	2:05 That is a broken man. :'(
William Costa Da Silva	The Championship is over, now it's work for 2019 season
Mortlock	Seeing Fernando Alonso's final races ending in DNF's with no fault of his own is really heartbreaking.

Kritz	Hartley needs a break man. Hope he has another chance next year. :(

RaptoR	Respect for Will Smith for teaching Hamilton how to drive lol
AwesomeExpress	Hey Liberty, I know your a bunch of old guys in suits who thought it would be "fresh" to have Will Smith congratulate Lewis over the radio, but if you could stop shoehorning a bunch of cheesy bullshit into F1 we would all appreciate it.   Not only does it fail at attracting a younger audience, but it alienates existing fans. You can attract new fans to F1 by emphasizing what is  already cool about F1 and transitioning to a more accessible viewing model (part of which you have done with the F1 youtube channel overhaul). Those are the only things you need to do, stop all the other pointless changes.
Sabuj Chatterjee	Where is "turn down my engine" from Verstappen's radio ?! .

AngW Alo14	Poor Fernando he could break the record :/
Fannie Nel	Cheaters
Luke Bassett	"a bunch of amateurs" from him!!!!!!

Kojum	dislike for will smith
Carlin	Will Smith is so overrated
Sourav Mishra	I like how Max haters are under a rock now. No I ain't a Max fan but that's what I noticed.

Lutfi J C	eh...hearing that on Lewis's radio, made me cringe the first time and it's still making me cringe. First Brian Tyler and his Fast and the Furious copy/pasta'ings then this crap. Darn! :O
soupe2000	I hoped Verstappen would have some empathy for Ricciardo but he must still be angry against him for taking the pole...
Adam1401	Real sad boy hours for Ricciardo and Alonso ;(
datzitteezy	Cringe Cringe  Cringing  Cringy  Cringe worthy
Stephen Taylor	Hartley went complete savage there-when he starts swearing you know he's angry. Ocon's radio message was quite refreshing and brutally honest.
teamspirit5	I guess a lot of people here haven’t seen Bad Boys 🙄
effisjens	2:15 someone give ricciardo a hug
Kyle	Imagine how many World Titles Will Smith could have won if he didn’t choose to do acting

Bjørnar Iversen	Will smith is a f'ing twat

Carlos César	''yea we dont need it but its nice'' Verstappen legend ahahahahaha omgggg

Mitra Das	Wish Alonso could atleast complete his final 2 races #LegendAlo14
Mohammed Azar	Will Smith is cringe. Please don't bring ignorant Americans who don't give a shit and who likes driving in rectangle to f1.
ScrewCaptain27	Hartley having the man-periods
Roger Mason	I bet Lewis did not agree with Will Smith's comment "that's the way to drive".  Sounded pretty stupid given that Lewis limped around on worn-out tires and was cruising at 70% pace at the end.  I'm sure Lewis did not think "that's the way to drive"
Anas Nurhafidz	Cruising Max 🔥🔥🔥
EarlCursed	You can really hear how Ricciardo was sad. He really needs to go to Renault as fast as he can
sadman hoque	why didn't they bring Hamilton's Dad or something who actually supported him through his racing career? quit it with the celebrity bullshit, Smith didn't do shit (that I know of)
TheKing	Wait, WILL SMITH THOUGH LEWIS??? (i thought they were referring to his dad or something.)
Diogo Braz	Ok so was I the only the who thought Ricciardo's Engineer said "Honey you're P1" after he got pole?

LisztyLiszt	"Just like I taught you." Ugh, someone needs to teach that clown how not to speak like a moron over a radio being listened to by millions. Cringe!
reelkena	What's worse, hearing Will Smith, or Lewis getting handed another undeserved title.
Amir Hakiem	Alonso has no pain for retirement. But still mad if someone crash to him
Wildfire	They shouldn't allow celebrities anywhere near the mics to the driver at any point during a race weekend.   Most of these non-F1 knowing cunts wouldn't know an apex to save their life.
Adrian Wong	YOU ARE THE MAN! - Bono (Lewis' Engineer)
Aditya S	Danny Ric is second Alonso
jens schouten	The whole race, there was a bit of panic in the red bull garage

Reicky Tcharles	Sounds like the drivers are talking inside a bathroom.
Marponsa	the defeat in ricciardo's voice hurts my heart ;;
Abysmal Luck	When Max has a title contending car we can expect a lot more of these "slow it down" comments on the radio 😂 He's just cruising... makes me wonder why they'd even ask him to slow down if it's not harming the engine...
Igor	Honda of the day: Renault
iliovecaRS	Thank you for will Smith for teaching Hamilton how to drive, without the help of our Lord and savior wheel Smith we wouldn't be where we are today 🙌🤲👃

Prithak Shrestha	The disappointment in Ricciardo's voice after having to retire after getting pole was saddening.
MRsebav1 `	P0Alonso P0Ricciardo

GURken	*Lewis finishing 4th 20 sec behind Kimi *Will Smith:* _"That's how you supposed to drive!"_

JBaly	i didn't now will smith is in f1 😂
Thirza	2:18 What an amazing conversation hahaha, shows that he's a pure racer💪🏼
Uğur	Will Smith’s radio comm was cringeworthy. He had nothing significant to say, and he repeated the same thing over and over again for the sake being on the radio. Ten year olds form better sentences.
Tanay Patil	Feels bad for Ricciardo
Ian Huizenga	Will Smith was cringe tbh
Titan FX	TRIPPIN' MAJOR NUTSACC
Unlucky Benny	Poor Danny man. You can just hear all enthusiasm leave his voice.
Ashwin Mascarenhas	Atleast Gionovazzi has a seat for next year. Hartley is bang average. Marko has gone a bit soft,should've been out mid season
