{'raidernation901': "Braxton I was raised a LA Raider fan I was born in 81 I didn't know our history or tradition , I always thought we were the LA Raiders until we went back to Oakland in 95 and for a while it took me along time to call us the Oakland Raiders, but in High school after I did my research I found out our history and tradition started in Oakland so as a grown man in his 30's I know we belong in Oakland, hope we make this happen #foreveroakland", 'Braxton Oertwig': "My name is Braxton Oertwig\xa0of Las Vegas\xa0Nevada,\xa0I\xa0just wanted to say that I have been a life long fan of the OAKLAND RAIDERS; kept on following the raiders when AL Davis decided to move the team to LA because he was not going to be told by the NFL at the time that he could not move his team out of OAKLAND. I to this day i\xa0felt he had made a mistake when he moved to LA but I forgave him when he moved back in 1995 to OAKLAND.\xa0 I believe the truth about the history of the Raiders and RAIDER\xa0NATION \xa0lies in the city of OAKLAND, is it not true that the most note worthy games for the\xa0\xa0Raiders claim to NFL fame was the( HOLY ROLLER GAME, THE GHOST IN THE POST GAME, THE IMMACULATE RECPTION GAME, THE FAMOUS HIDY GAME VS THE JETS) ALL CAME AS THE OAKLAND RAIDERS NOT THE LA RAIDERS BUT THE OAKLAND RAIDERS. As OAKLAND RAIDER NATION FANS we were proud and still are Proud of this heritage the players from these OAKLAND RAIDER SQUADS gave us TO BE THE MOST PROUDEST WIN LOSE TIE UNTIL WE DIE\xa0OAKLAND RAIDER\xa0FANS OUT THERE; because the players from the OAKLAND RAIDERS squads were tough SOB'S that never took crap from the opposition they will always have my respect forever.\xa0 Now with all of that being said, I cannot believe there is a chance the raiders might be moving back to LA and if that does come true I WILL RETIRE MYSELF FROM THE RAIDER NATION\xa0AS A\xa0OAKLAND RAIDER FAN THAT IS WHERE MY HEART LIES WITH THE OAKLAND RAIDERS AND THE OAKLAND RAIDER NATION. I believe the Raiders fans that are in LOS ANGELES SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BEGINING OF WHERE THE RAIDERS CAME FROM AND HELP THE CITY OF OAKLAND COME TO A DEAL TO GET\xa0COLISEUM CITY ON\xa0TRACK\xa0 BECAUSE\xa0OAKLAND IS WHERE\xa0THE RAIDERS BELONG. TO THOSE IN LOS ANGELES THAT CLAIM TO BE RAIDER FANS AND WANT TO STEAL THEM BACK YOU LACK SLIVER AND BLACK AND YOU\xa0SHOULD BECOME RAMS FANS BECAUSE IT\xa0IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU DONT KNOW THE RAIDERS HISTORY AT ALL.\xa0 MR DAVIS UNDERSTAND THIS, SOME THINGS ARE WORTH MORE\xa0AND GO BEYOND \xa0MONEY AND THAT IS THE\xa0 RAIDERS HISTORY WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND. PLEASE TRY TO STAY IN OAKLAND SIR I BELIEVE YOU CAN ITS POSSIBLE."}
