NOT ONLY the first 10, 30 seconds or half of it, but THE WHOLE VIDEO! It will prove that u are interested in the video and not here just for increasing the views. Youtube will paying ONLY for '' faithful '' views, keep it in mind!Also to those who said that watching the first 10 - 30 seconds of the video will counted as view - it's available for Spotify, but it doesn't work on Youtube;\n\n2) Watch the video in HD (720p, at least )! Youtube logic is that users will watch the video in the most comfortable for their eyes quality. We all know how 360/240/144p are sucks, and if we can afford - we are always trying to put it in higher quality. If u can afford - stream in HD! if ur device hasn't HD or ur internet connection is low - then 480p is allowed;\n\n3) DON'T skip, stop or rewind the video;\n\n4) The sound on ur phone should be more then 50%, u can use earphones on it, but the sound should stay more then 50%! U can mute the sound on ur laptop and PC, but be sure that the volume on Youtube is more then 50%;\n\n5) Before rewatching the same video u should DELETE the watching and searching history ( the watching history is THE BROWSING HISTORY and the searching history is COOKIES );\n\n6) LOG OUT after the first watching of the video bc from one acc u can watch the same video ONLY ONCE in hour!\n\nBut if u have a few accounts - then delete the whole history after watching the video, log out from one\n\nacc and log in another one, close a tab and open a new one and then research this MV again for rewatching. Don't forget to leave comments and likes;\n\n7) STREAM MANUALLY! Don't use the playlists and loops when u have a free time for watching the videos on Youtube. Playlists and loops are the main reason of freezing the views for a long time, also not all of views from them will be counted by Youtibe system, only 10 - 30%!\n\nBy using playlists and loops u are just proving that u are LISTENING TO THE SOUND FROM THE VIDEO, but NOT WATCHING IT AT ALL! And Youtube is a VIDEO portal where u should WWATCH THE VIDEOS, not a music portal like Spotify.\n\nRemember that Youtube like to delete '' unfaithful '' views.\n\n8) DON'T USE multiple tabs or incognito mode - they are counted as SPAM and ur views will be deleted for sure!\n\n9) Don't replay the video or refresh the page for rewatching - ur views will be counted as SPAM and will be deleted for sure!\n\n10) DON'T SKIP THE ADS! They are counted as part of the video and if u will skip them - u actually will skip the video and ur views will not counted by Youtube;\n\n10) Don't change the speed of the video!\n\n11) Use different browsers ( Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome and etc ), accounts, internet connections ( Wi - Fi and mobile data ), devices ( PC, TV, phone, laptop ) for streaming of the videos - these things will helping to increase the views!\n\n12) Comment, Like, Share by the video on social media and with friends!\n\n13) AND NOW THERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE: you CAN'T REWATCH the same video again and again without any gaps!!!!!!!! If u will rewatch Not Today on repeat again and again - ur views will be counted as SPAM and\n\ndeleted for sure", 'Sabariah Mahmud': "Im using my mom's acc to watch this.

Vi3w freezing hours after hours and even got deleted (a lot), but you know why they still had that incredible amount of vi3ws even when shits happened like this? That's because their fandoms are huge!! By huge i literally mean HUGE!!.. Increasing the vi3ws is the fandoms first goal (especially the ones that can't support their group with streaming on Korean music sites and/ or buying albums). So with the strong delicate and that much people ready to str3am all day, of course even if many of them didn't know the right way to str3am, nctzen is no doubt still yet reach that level. Many people assumed that this problem only happened with sm artists, no! It happened with every video that increased millions of vi3ws in the first hour, especially with music videos. However, videos with low vi3ws(under 1000 vi3ws) didn't seem to get applied the same rules as the high vi3ws ones, i heard some said that you can watch half the video but youtube could still count yours as one vi3w. Ridiculous i know but with trending mvs nowadays where billions of vi3ws aren't seem hard to get (example: despacito), they will do everything to stop increasing the vi3w.

Honestly my point is all the negative comment about low views and ive been streaming for hours is annoying like 1 person giving a video 1,000 views doesn’t give real achievement to the artist cause truly and honestly not tht many ppl have seen it I generally just look at the likes of the video.

Otherwise, your view will not be counted. The view count will freeze because YT will consider it as spam.\n\nYou can make a playlist. But put it on loop and shuffle. Then add at least two other music videos. Streaming manually is still better though. But when you are busy, you can just use playlists. \n\nThank you so much for reading!

All the members were at their own desks, working hard, for the goals that they dream of (hence why they fall asleep). Irregular office was all the members just partying and being obnoxious with the money they have, sort of like the english version of the song, just being cocky and arrogant with their wealth. At the end, you can see none of this is actually true, as it takes you back to _reality_ of all of them just working in the office like normal workers. \n\neven on the tracklist, they explained that while the first half is "regular"/"reality" the second half of the tracklist is "irregular"/"dream".

You can't expect all 10 members to have the same amount of lines and screen time in a 3min song. Plust if you pay attention this is fair. Yes, Taeyong and Mark had the most screen time and lines (coz obviously it's a hip-hop song and others can't pull of their parts as good as these two can), but Doyoung and Taeil even tho they didn't have much screen time they got lot of lines, they were basically singing the whole chorus. Jaehyun had fair lines and screen time. Haechan had his time to shine as well. If you watch the  English and Korean ver you'll notice that Jungwoo had another part as well, plus he stand out in the mv. And those who didn't have much lines like Johnny, Yuta and WinWin had a lot of screen time. SO overall there's nothing much to complain.

The Eng. Ver. MV focused more on the aesthetics while in this one it really highlights the members and focuses on them. As for the certain scenes being in different parts of the vid, I really like how they placed them because imo the transitions were much smoother (?? not rlly sure if this is the word I\'m looking for lmao) as opposed to the Eng. Ver and I really like that. In the Eng. Ver. everything in the MV seemed to happen v fast which gave it a more powerful (?? not sure if this is the right word to describe again lol) impact and also complimented the whole ~aesthetic~ there. On the other hand, this version was more chill yet it still keeps that powerful impact. I was thinking that maybe I found this ver. different from the other because I\'m used to the other ver. but I played the Eng. Ver. while this MV was playing and what I found out was that this MV does seem more chill?? Like it still has that impact like I said before (lmao I\'m starting to use like a lot sdkljakjfd), but it\'s just more chill (lol I\'m being repetitive). It\'s most likely because it compliments the language (Korean) they\'re singing here. It\'s the same song, but when sung in different languages it gives off different vibes causing differences in the MVs (the "feeling" it gives off and the actual differences). If you compare the Eng. translations of the Korean Ver. to the actual Eng. Ver., the Eng. Ver. boasts the idea of being rich and living that rich life while the Korean Ver also points out the value of who they are as a person and is a tad bit humbler (ex. "Ice out both my wrists now I can barely see the time" vs. "To all the people that dropped me, please stop hitting my line", "Hopped out the coupe, the sky is the roof, my whole team ball. We never lose, hundreds all blue, we do what we do" vs "I fly to the sky, paint paintings, in my mind we never lose. Surpassing the limit, we do what we do.")\n\nOverall, it\'s up to personal preference which MV or Ver. one likes!!!

It's clear that this song with its melody and the beat was primarily intended for NCT's promotion in the US. What I also don't get is why the Seoul division of NCT (which is 127)  is promoting in the US rather than debuting their American division or having NCT U do it.

You don't know the struggle of watching your bias not even getting a single line. Of course we are PISSED and I have reached a LIMIT here. Yes, I like NCT and I wanna support them but the way Johnny is treated CONSTANTLY during their comebacks makes me feel tired and way less excited.

This buildings scene is parallel to Boss). He "flew" from NCT U to NCT 127. So now Jungwoo has arrived completing 1+2+7, will there be more limitless member add up to NCT127? Prolly NO. Because at 3:36, the car they drove thru the tunnel is now outside and in Eng MV at 3:30, they\'ve shown driving the same car out from tunnel. Remember the tunnel that was seem endless in Limitless? They found their way out.
