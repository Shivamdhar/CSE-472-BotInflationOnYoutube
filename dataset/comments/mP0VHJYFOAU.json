In Mr Robot I could not read the dialogue but I understood the main point.

You have to really suspend that disbelief. The man who plays Freddie -- you have to really believe is Freddie. And we didn\'t feel that could really happen with Sacha."*\n\nCasting opinions from the band members themselves carry more weight than anybody else, yes? They\'ve seen Cohen audition as Freddie, we haven\'t.  They personally knew Freddie, we didn\'t.  They know what works for them as Queen.  They are more qualified than anybody here to determine whether actor A, B, or C would be compelling as Freddie.\n\nLet\'s just enjoy the movie in its entirety and argue less about who is playing Freddie.

Whereas, Brian is shown in this really positive and dramatic light, showing how he had the idea for 'We Will Rock You'. Roger is shown as a drama queen but in a really funny way, and both he and Brian's positive relationship with Freddie is made obvious. It's sad because John was said to have had a close friendship with Freddie also, to the point where he did not carry on with Queen after Freddie died, because he felt Queen was not the same without him. I just hope that despite Brian and Roger's supposed fractured relationship with John, and with the pair of them being so involved in the making of this movie, that they can still include John's contribution to the band.

Don't get me wrong, I love this band, but it might not work if all the songs are hamfisted in and abrupt. Also, if this is a musical, there's a major problem.\n\nSinging out-of-plot (Like a lot of the songs in Mamma Mia) can work out with musicals, and it makes sense. They all suddenly sing, everyone can magically dance. I won't comment on the logistics of it all. But there are problems when you mix this with a band. Is the band singing IN the movie half the time or are they singing out of plot? Are we hearing a real performance that they're supposedly putting on, or are we hearing a classic out-of-plot song, and the setting of said song is in a concert hall?\n\nThis sounds dumb, yes, why would they be performing an out-of-plot song if they're a band in a movie? Well there are many ways this can happen.\n\nThink back to The Greatest Showman, Never Enough. It was a generic pop song in a time when two people couldn't date if they were different races. I hope this movie doesn't do anything similar to that, but that's just one example of a mix up. That song, Never Enough, was being performed, but the question is, was it actually pop in the plot? Was the song she was singing just turned into pop for us to enjoy it? If it were pop in that time frame, it would not have worked at all. It was a very strange mix up.\n\nWhat if there's a moment in this movie where they're not at a performance, but just at an event or something, and they start playing a song. Everyone dances, etc etc. Are we meant to believe that's a part of the plot, or it's just another song shoved in? It might just get confusing!

If you like feel good edm music then you might wanna read this... When life gets rough there's always that one thing we as humans can go back to and feel like everything is alright. In my opinion that thing is good music. There have been so many days before when I was younger where everything seemed so overwhelmingly negative... Like there was no light at the end of my tunnel. But then I started listening to my idols, marshmello and zedd included, and somehow it made me feel some sort of way... Almost like a hope entered into my life. At that moment I knew what my dream in life was.\n\n I wanted to make music like my favorite artists. I knew I'd never be able to even afford a keyboard so it stayed a dream, buried deep inside me never to see the light of day. Until now that is. Here I am  few years later and I'm making the music I'd always look for but never could find. This journey in my life has been amazing... And I want to help people feel the same way by listening to the music I create... I wanna be able to make memories for other people. I want people to hear my music and let it change your day for the better! That's why I started making music. 🌌They're not your typical dance tracks. My songs are flooded with emotion and vibes.\n\n They're very spacey and futuristic. They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger, almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy... I'm not trying to boast. I'm just trying to help you all feel good vibes. And in 2018, I think alot more people need that. If you could help me out by checking my songs it would mean so much. I promise you won't regret it. Thank you for being one of my first fans if you choose to listen. 🙏 I'll forever remember the first people who supported me... <3", 'D.T.B': 'http://viral481.com/srv.html?id=5447862&pub=858330 \nWorking at home moms click here', 'Johnny Loves Steel Balls': 'Is that the real Freddie?
