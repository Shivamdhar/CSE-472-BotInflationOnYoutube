EhsanTmusique	I saw this brilliant movie last weekend. In the end of the film while the lights were on, women & men in the cinema were in their tears. When Gaga was getting ready to film the final scene, where she sings "I'll Never Love Again", she got a phone call that her childhood friend (Sonja Durham) was in her last moments of cancer. Gaga left the set and drove to meet Sonja, but she was late by 10 minutes after her friend passed away. Sonja's husband consoled her and asked to return for filming. The singer recalled that Sonja gave me a tragic gift that day and I took it with me to set, and I sang that song for Jackson and for her on that very same day within an hour. Bradley Cooper was supportive about Gaga's loss but Gaga was adamant in finishing the scene. So she stepped on the set and sang I'll Never Love Again. Just in case, who loves this movie and GaGa, then may check my channel and my song, which called "Life" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfTnRjsyvlo  ;-)

Yaro Alyanok	i love you
atira	Here because I've read this song might worth an Oscar. Didn't even knew this song existed. The best thing about this video is seeing Gaga naturally, that is with minimal makeup (if any, I don't know, I'm a guy) and in normal clothes. The song... started out promising, but it didn't quite live up to the promise in the end. It also feels kind of generic, doesn't really show anything special or unique, travelling along safe roads. Is it worth an Oscar? That depends on the other nominees. Even a <*summons Immortan Joe*> mediocre song can win among less than mediocre ones.

Performing at the super bowl 6. A star is born  How can one woman achieve so much in such a short period of time? As an older guy I think it’s safe to say she is clearly one of the biggest and most memorable names of all time.

Tetheas	I was NOT ready for this movie....
Niarka Shamsid-deen	I absolutely love this song. The movie is amazing to.
Zombie Boy	Latín América?
HugGest	I watched Bohemian Rhapsody and this right after. Shockingly, this movie left bigger impact on me. And I am an 80’s kid who grew up listening to Queen and MJ. This will be a classic movie many decades from now. Lastly, I knew Bradley was a good actor but he was unbelievably good in this movie. Like Tom Hanks good.
Din Sousa	rainha 😍👑
Aaliyah Morris	I literally just got back from the movies from watching this and I can honestly say this is one of the best movies to come out this year 💯 this movie is sooo sad & heartfelt 😩❤️ and they both did an amazing job 👏🏽 I hope they really win an Oscar for this

Ana C	QUE FILME
Molly Black	Gaga, I love that sound.
Candie Kane	For some reason I can't reply to those stating Lady Gaga is beautiful without make-up. I agree 100%. However its part of her act when she does the flashy costumes and make-up. I think her talent and passion for music is what I find most beautiful especially after seeing this movie on Sunday. We knew she could sing but also a brilliant performance on the acting side. Love!

Jenny Stiller	Completely and totally one of the most amazing songs I’ve ever heard
Danilo Rost	O may god 💓💓💓💓💓💓
Slackburn Girl	Jesus Mary and Joseph they are SPECTACULAR together. When he kisses her it’s as if everybody should just pass out from the need of it. He comes in and finds her and they save each other from the shallow of it all.. no matter the addiction it’s the love that mattered and that they managed to get there.. the addiction was not something that he wanted it was just a monster that they fought to be able to know each other.  When he touched her boot on the bike ,, my GOD I could actually feel the touch of his hand through the leather ...this man came in ( Bradley Cooper in his real life as this character) and showed the world the true depth of his soul as a person. He didn’t have to do this , and I’m sure it was a wonderful experience yet so hard at the same time. To immerse yourself in that PLACE. She was amazing in that she picked up every little subtle nuance that he wanted to convey and worked it into something so real and true. If you have every dealt with addiction or lost someone to it I so do hope you can find comfort in this story they made together. They deserve an award and nothing but beautiful things said about them for bringing us a film so honest and raw.

antonella stanzani	It's such a moving film. Deeply recomanded. Happy to have seen it again  in original language. It touched my soul. They, with their music, lyrics and songs: Shallow, always remember us this way, is that alright and  in the final show: I'll never love again" entered my body and kept my heart beating. Him such a tender man full of cares for Allay, her, so passionate and devoted to Jack  despite all odds. Bradley turned this rendition of "A Star is born" into a masterpiece. Lady Gaga contribuited to make the film great by giving her human touch in such a crazy foolish world.
Antonio Carlos de Lima	Amei  muito o filme. Lindo demais. Lady Gaga esteve suave e intensa de um jeito que só ela sabe contrastar.

Julio Rodrigues	Without words for this song, she's simply amazing ... Lady Gaga really is the best person that Bradley Cooper could have chosen to play in the movie A Star Is Born, because she was just radiant here in my hometown of Jaguariaíva state of Paraná in Brazil, I went in all sections watching the movie. And Lady Gaga was a great performer, both in performance and in music! I love Lady Gaga Forever.

Юлия Ход	Вы создали что-то грандиозное для меня. Слушаю в 50 раз. Спасибо за эмоции
Bella Coates	*The end of this movie had me crying...*
chuggggggy	Did she still needed to prove people wrong about her talent in music? Man, people don't pay attention. Her album Joanne has country sounding, rock sounding songs. She made a Jazz album with Tony Bennet, won a Grammy for it. Or for her talent in acting? She acted on American Horror Story, two seasons, won an Emmy and a Golden Globe there. All of that I'm adding fyi is if you underappreciate her eccentric LADY GAGA the popstar persona, which is a ton of people couldn't stand her I guess but the vocals and songwriting were always there. Still reading a lot of comments from intolerant old folks realizing she is a great singer until this movie, for fuck's sake...
ariana grande’s mind amazes me	Can someone explain to me what happened at 2:33 i thought that performance was recorded live but you can hear gaga's voice but not her voice moving because shes moving the mic and then she starts singing at 2:34

Nick VOS	Yesterday my little sister died... She had cancer...When I learnt that she died, I couldn't control myself... I didn't know what to do... I tried to relax... And I found out that this song makes me forget everything, forget what's going on around me, this song gives me power... I hope my little sis be in a better place right now... I love you Alison...

Tandidien og gamer	Hello
Paul John Cayabyab	I am moved! Are you?😢😢
Noteman	Call it, “A star is boring.”  Coop not talented enough to act and direct.  Movie was slow and boring.  Forced electricity between the two.  Drunk entire movie.  Great voice.  Hard to look at. Only thing in this movie that’s good is the last song. Forced dead space is not acting.  It’s boring.

Leon Liu	I’m not a Gaga fan, but a filmgoer(I’ve almost watched a film twice a day since I was a little boy). I really admire Gaga for being so passionate about the art she devotes. I was totally amazed by Gaga’s performance in “A Star Is Born.” I think she will definitely be nominated for an Academy Award!   　　Some might say Lady Gaga has changed a lot in this movie. But in fact, she has immersed herself in this minimal, pure style since her last album “Joanne.” If you’ve watched her documentary “Gaga: Five Foot Two,” you would know that in the early years of her career, her radical outfits and performances somewhat were resistance against the unfairness of the media and music industry.  　　She’s an artist, and she’s been trying her best to convey her deepest emotion. That’s an unchangeable truth.
Anton Kristić	Super
Eloise Deschamps	I wasn't much of a fan... but now I'm hooked! That was the most moving and beautiful experience!!!! Thank you xxx
panicked honk	that vocalization is otherworldly. just... wow
Muhammad Ali AL.	Wow… i am so like Lady Gaga like this. She looks a real woman. Her voice so amazing talent…
Sweet Stuff	Ya know that tingle you get down the back of your neck, your back, then your legs when you hear an amazing voice sing an amazing song?  Yeah, that.  This movie is full of those moments.  Thank you to Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga!  Best movie I've seen since American Sniper.
LetsGoToBilka	So cute when Lady Gaga stepping at 2:56 singing her heart out and her reaction when the crowd gives big applause at the ending at 3:36

Sharkey Martin	Lady Gaga is really taking over the world "ONE SEQUIN AT A TIME"  The Fame / The Fame Monster > The very essence of being famous. Pop Superstardom  Born This Way > Self acceptance and knowing your individuality and uniqueness. LGBT icon  ARTPOP > Experimentation and technology, fusing art and pop. Shows her edge over other pop stars.  Cheek to Cheek > Jazz album with Tony Bennett. Vocal ability revealed, gaining her more mature audience.  Joanne > A personal album of hers, dedicated to a family member. Country music vibes.  Superbowl > Heartfelt National Anthem performance & Over the top Halftime show. Undeniably good!  AHS > Acting ability for television. Gained her first acting award.  A Star is Born > Well, the title says it.  Lady Gaga is still underrated up to this day. She has yet to reveal more, so let's all appreciate her talent. She doesn't wanna go with the flow, she has her own wave.

Sabine Doherty	yes sure Gaga really shows herself to be a real musician instead of merely a pop icon; but folks:  #BradleyCooperIsARevelation for real!!!!!  not only did he spend 2 years learning to sing, play both guitar and piano, and direct; he also learned to lower the pitch of his voice by an octave and was a driving force behind getting this masterpiece incarnation a star is born made!  our hats are off to you Bradley!!!  you are a powerhouse!

Or do you need more Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?  [Refrain: Lady Gaga] I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low In the sha-sha-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Ooooo aahaaa ooou (s) Ooo ouo oooo haaaa (s)  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-sha-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now

Leon JO	This scene was so much more powerful in the actual movie.
Jieqiong Wu	Bradly Cooper has such a nice voice！
zero blackcat	MASSIVE respect to both Gaga and especially Bradley Cooper, he took a year and a half worth of vocal lessons for his role in this movie and to make it as optimistic and real as possible, that's just how passionate he is as an artist and as a human. What's even more extraordinary, every song in this movie was recorded live, and it can get more authentic then that. Now what's missing, is a tour for A Star is Born with all its songs. I have this song on repeat and can't get enough.
Julie Howland	Makes me cry every time!

John Fitzpatrick	Lady Gaga is outstanding in this movie as a legit actress. She really shows how talented she is. However, to me, Cooper really killed it at every level. To learn how to play the guitar, how to sing, be involved in writting a lot of the songs for the movie and also directing the movie....epic performance.
Tana Costa	im not crying you are...
Amber Grimm	Gaga, just Gaga. BEAUTIFUL!
Daniel Alexander	she's so talented and pretty lady without that weird make up she always wore before.

eeveeshinyhunter	I love the part when she sings "I'm off the deep end. Watch as I dive in. I never leave the ground." Her voice is so beautiful. She looks completely different without all that make-up. She is a beautiful woman.

Shimmering Drums	Love ❤️ everything about this song, Lady Gaga and Brad do a magnificent job and are a great pair for this song. Both are extremely talented and have great voices. Especially the lady when she hits those high ranges. Great writer in lyrics, and  great actors as well. Haven't seen a good movie in years and was completely emotionally involved from the beginning and understood the story line extremely well. The love story was beautiful, but such a sad ending 😞💔 .
Danna Perez	This song is so beautiful and my favorite song. The movie is so cute, wonderful, and very sad. I'm a huge fan of Lady Gaga since like 2009.

i- Cha	E dimmi ragazza, Sei felice in questo mondo moderno, O vuoi di più? Stai cercando qualcos'altro? Io sto precipitando.. . . . Nei periodi belli cerco di cambiare me stesso, Ma nei brutti periodi io ho paura di me stesso. . . . E dimmi ragazzo, Non ti sei stancato di provare a riempire quel vuoto che hai dentro? Vuoi di più? Non è difficile restare così impassibile? Io sto precipitando.. . . . Sono fuori di testa, guarda come precipito Non toccherò mai il fondo, Mi schianto sulla superficie, dove non possiamo farci male.. ..Siamo Lontani dalla Riva Adesso...

許嚖庭	Tell me somethin', girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah!  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Maria Nimfa Rovira	Since her oscar award rendition of The Sound of Music, Lady Gaga proved she can definitely sing. And yeah after several stints at American Horror Story, she also proved she can act. I like her now than before. And if you noticed, her nose is similar to the original A Star is Born actress Barbra Streisand. She definitely lived to that standard...

Monica Mc Carney	I saw this last nite. Lady Gaga you are so incredibly talented, songwriter, producer, your voice is amazing.  Please don't allow the pitfalls of celebrity life, as in alcohol and other substances affect your talent, your life. I know a little bout music, just as a hobby, playing piano, singing. I'm a Diana Krall fan as I love jazz. How about some more jazz albums and tours please?  Do all that amazing music of Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin and Benny Goodman. As you get older, you will appreciate these more. Hey! You know this music. Don't be steered into overly produced music. Try more raw and acoustic productions. You have the such versatility, I listen a mostly to your unplugged tracks and album with Tony Bennett. 1st and 2 albums too. Your range and power and breath control are superb, your piano accompaniments are amazing.

Luke Gomes	I was never a Lady gaga fan. But this song is the turning point. As I see, most of the people here including me wishing for an Oscar for the Lady. In past, most people didn't receive Oscar even though they deserved it. Hope it won't happen here.  Lady Gaga, drop the makeups and do some more songs like this. Hope this will be a turning point :)

Myworldisoksurviving ButIamkindof	Lady gaga is so beautiful without make up. Wow, she looks amazingly pretty. Love her.
Bibliophile Lady	I know that Bradley is supposed to be the tragic figure in this movie, but did it strike anyone else as tragic that as Ally goes through her journey, she is becoming more and more like Gaga?  I feel like this is literally her authentic story, being told nobody would listen to her unless she disguised her looks and distracted with glitz, makeup, and dancers.
Carla Ramos	Shallow  Tell me somethin', girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah!  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

I know it doesn't end well because I saw the original movie with Judy Garland and James Mason years ago. Never saw the one with Streisand and Kristofferson. This pair look so dynamic together. Every video song is fantastic. I sense a big cry coming.

bumblebee263	Watching and hearing stuff like paparrazi and poker face I was intrigued but couldn’t help but wonder whether all that wonderfully blinding flash was backed by any real substance. I know that for true fans I am late to the realization but for me now there is no doubt: Strip all of the glitter and gloss away, every bit of it, and you are left with a talent that is very easy to see and that is so deep and so rich that when it is all said and done she may be remembered as an icon for the ages. It will be fascinating to see how the arc of her career proceeds.

I know I'm wrong and she has every right not to see me again, but I feel so heart heartbroken. How can I miss someone I never had? Next I have to fight the coward in me and tell my gf. They say everyone is fighting a battle no one knows about? My battle has always been the coward in me. Today I came across this song, has been helping me fight my battles.

Amy__ X	Wow I good major goosebumps at 2:35
federico bosio	È bello sentire che la musica ancora riesce a far vibrare qualcosa di inaspettato, è inaspettata anche un'immagine così diretta da parte di una star, di questi tempi. Credo che questa cantante rimarrà iconica e seguita per molti anni proprio per la sua base umana ed artistica pulita e stabile , artefatta in superficie ma salda nella costruzione. Brava lei e un  bravo a chi ne cura attorno tutte le scelte musicali e di marketing. Streisand docet ! 💎
Cary Layman	I just love her

giorgio	canzoncina mediocre con un testo puerile che piacerà soprattutto ai ragazzi che non capiscono la lingua inglese  altrimenti avrete capito che le canzoni di Valerio Scanu o di Marco Carta o di Gigi D'Alessio (per fare qualche esempio nostrano) sono più poetiche ed hanno molti più spessore e contenuti di questa commercialissima ballad scritta con il  solo intento di scalare le charts internazionali e per mettere in mostra la notevole estensione vocale di Lady Germanotta.
Michał Rakowski	Bradley is perfect voice . Lady is perfect voice and look (without make up). Perfect song ?

gerrit okkema	www.law-universe.com new funtion of the internet ! help me help you !
Jeremiah Osburn	I will preface this with I am not a Lady Gaga fan, before this movie, I am definitely a fan of Bradley Cooper. This is one of the best movies I’ve seen in the past five years. Bradley sang well enough to be believable, and Lady Gaga acted well enough to think she was a typical Hollywood actress. Her singing was outstanding, I did not know the plot coming in, I was brought to tears, & the singing and acting was amazing. I would go see the movie again even though I already know it’s ending, if anything else, just to hear them sing again!
cance7984	I can't get this movie's soundtrack out of my head. It's simply captivating.
jay mon	The feels

Pamela Juárez	Dime algo, chica,  ¿eres feliz en este mundo moderno? ¿O necesitas más? ¿Hay algo más que estés buscando?  Estoy cayendo. En todos los buenos momentos, me descubro ansiando un cambio,  y en los malos momentos, me doy miedo a mí mismo.  Dime algo, chico,  ¿no estás cansado de intentar llenar ese vacío? ¿O necesitas más? ¿No es difícil hacer que siga siendo tan intenso?  Estoy cayendo. En todos los buenos momentos, me descubro ansiando un cambio,  y en los malos momentos, me doy miedo a mí mismo.  Me voy a las profundidades,  mira mientras me zambullo. Nunca tocaré el suelo,  atravesaré la superficie donde no nos puedan hacer daño. Ahora estamos lejos de la superficie (lo trivial, superficial).  En la superficie, superficie. En la superficie, superficie. En la superficie, superficie. Ahora estamos lejos de la superficie.  Me voy a las profundidades,  mira mientras me zambullo. Nunca tocaré el suelo,  atravesaré la superficie donde no nos puedan hacer daño. Ahora estamos lejos de la superficie.  En la superficie, superficie. En la superficie, superficie. En la superficie, superficie. Ahora estamos lejos de la superficie.  Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper

Ryan Rook	I cannot wait to see this movie I have been playing this song on repeat for I don't know how many hours now I love Lady Gaga. She has one of those rare voices that can reach straight through your flesh and penetrates your soul and once it's there it somehow heals you from the inside out. It's the kind of voice that sends shivers down your spine and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up
Dijana K	I LOVE THIS MOVIE GAGA AND BRADLEY SOOOO MUCH ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Mary Stotlar	Got to have this sound track from movie.
Leslie Perez	I couldn't watch La La Land as I hate musicals, but this... THIS is something else. Musical songs are usually lame, this one instead is truly amazing. I hope this film will be decisive for Bradley to finally win an Oscar, as he practiced a lot to become a musician, and as the director and main character of this film. Gaga's performance was beyond my expectations. I don't think she'll win an Oscar as female leading actress, but I am quite sure that she will win an Oscar for Best Song.  Please, make rock great again. I have nothing against pop or trap, I just prefer rock, and Gaga and Bradley sound so well together 😍
lanier1000	Terrible.   She either makes fabulous songs or trash, imho.  This one goes in the round file.

I’m melting ..

Tiffany O'Brien	So I saw this movie the day it came out, after waiting six months for it. I went at 18:30 I fell in love with the story line, was gripped by the love, performances, continued forgiveness and the mental illness aspect.  Now I know everyone has been, is going through this or knows someone who is struggling with this HORRIBLE illness, but I did not see this coming. I am not expecting a pity party but I haven’t had an easy life. Now when going into this movie I thought great love movie etc. I got so attached to the character and the love, when it came to the end I actually could not breathe I ran out of the cinema and cried and didn’t see the ending.  It was so close to my heart i felt sick.  I regret not going back in but I’m so glad that it was raw and not sugar coated. That’s what the world needs to know and talk about.   Hope this helps someone out there, God bless you!

Neizan Algren	siempre me dio asco esta mujer pero acabo de cambiar de opinion, acojonante voz
ZEN DAYA	I love the movie she did, I advise you to go see it is great and it made us realize some real life ... the title is « a star is born » ⭐️ And this music is the best  (Sorry for My english im french) ❤️
peace and blue	Lady Gaga like 'Raquel in La casa da papel' in this movie
Zeynep Yılmaz	Most perfect
Liz Ward	Yay - people in music movies that can sing and play well :-)
Shaun Murray	I'm not often a sucker for fictional movies, I can't say I have truly liked many of them that have come out in the past few years at all. this film is a fantastic exception however! so well acted and some of the scenes are so elevating that it gave me Goosebumps multiple times throughout. the story is so amazingly well done and watching this film was such a great experience yet so utterly get wrenching at the same time (in a good way though). I have never uncontrollably cried in a cinema before (I haven't cried like that in years, but I wasn't quite as bad as my Girlfriend :) ), I'm the type of person that can watch the Notebook totally dry-eyed...…………..such an emotionally stimulating film to watch. I guarantee, it will resinate with you even the day after you watch it. I just love it!!!
kaseranmunian	This is so epic! The movie , the music , the emotions. Love it to bits ❤️❤️❤️
Mantas Kislius	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Ly04qwAt0 Check Lithuania version :)

Rebecca Ruiz	Hello ! My name is Rebecca and If this idea works than I would be honored !!!!! I think another movie should come out about jacks life before he met allí and how he turned to drinking , it should go something like maby the brother remembering him and just telling there child hood story to allí , anywaise if someone has contact with Bradley Cooper let him know I've got some ideas  😁👍🏻✅😜
Seb Heatnation	Sooooooooooooooo beautiful !!!!!!!

alonsovy	Everyone saying "Lady gaga is back" but the real question is.. When she gone?
raynor rodriguez	gaga 😍
Sergio Osuna	This is pure excellence! Both of them at their best.
Tara Wagner	This part of the movie , when you can see every freaking thought and conflicting emotion move across Lady Gaga’s face, and then watch her let it all go and belt out those notes, then pull back from the experience...damn. I cry every time. She epitomizes the struggle of so many women in so many arenas stepping out of their fear to do something scary af. Powerful and moving. Such a deep respect for her and Bradley. They made magic.
Miley Tran	I hate the movie but I love the song
Gustavo  felipe freitas santos	Faria os dois
Nicole Everett	I was so blown away by both Lady Gaga's and Bradley Coppers performance in this beautiful film. The story line, their chemistry and of course the music... all fantastic

Sophie Sadeghi	This is what I learned from this movie: Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta/ gaga not only has a big nose 👃 but also ugliness.
Rommy Awee	Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Lady Gaga:] Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga:] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallo
Evelyn Deyanira Beltran	I have NEVER been a person to cry over a song especially when I don't have anything to cry about. With that said , I listened to this song , on the second time I played it I was in tears. I truly believe this song is bringing us the quality of music our generation is clearly begging for. Just real, raw , uncut music.

Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah!

Ahmad Munzir	I just realised that Bradley cooper is good singer.
Vic Catherine	A masterpiece!
Jake N.	I've never watched a single movie again because there was none that could touch me on a spiritual level. A Star is Born was able to achieve it, so it's been 3 times that I've watched it. It's such a special movie to me. You NEED to watch it. Watching a movie on a big screen is a whole different experience, comparing it to TV or PC.
Nazrie Adam	bradley cooper deserves praises and attention just as much as gaga gets for this film
Angel Grace	I can not wait to see this. It looks so good!

Nina Rici	I watched this film yesterday it so beautiful... I cried at the end like I have never done before. It's truly beautiful ❤
Marita A. Hansen	This film made me cry and I don't usually cry at films, the last one being The Daughter. I probably wouldn't have gone to the film if I knew the ending since it breaks one of my rules with choosing movies, but I'm glad I didn't know, because it's an incredible film, totally worth seeing. Both Bradley and Lady Gaga did a tremendous job, and this song... it is sooo good. I love both of their voices, and who knew Bradley had such a great voice! Now, I want to watch the 70s version. I might even go back and watch this one again too if it's still playing when my daughter gets back from Canada.

IVE595	I hate musical films, whether it’s a true musical or a film about rock stars.....until now!  I have no time for Lady Gaga or her various personas or music.....until now! This film and music have blown me away! Not only have I enjoyed the music but above all else I am so impressed with her acting skills, which I’m sure will be overlooked in praise of the music.

Phoebe Kaye	People who say it’s so nice to hear Gaga’s natural voice with all this emotion obviously only listen to the big hits from the beginning of her career and need to go listen to her most recent album joanne as well as just her entire catalogue in general, one of the most well known yet still underrated artists of our generation

Simona Kapusníková	I love that film! We went on it to cinema from school trip and it was amazing. Everybody were crying. I am going to watch this film again and again, especially now, in autumn. And the songs??! I love it. I am still listening it. My favourite is Shallow. (sorry for my English xd)
belle enigma15	She's absolutely stunning and dare I say that I actually think she did a better job than Barbara Streisand in the 1976 version of the movie. Streisand's voice is powerful but Gaga's has a depth that conveys emotion that actually picks up on the pain and agony behind the lyrics.
Melfis Kennways	It gave me HUGE GOOSEBUMPS while I'm in the theater just a few hours back.......I already felt like crying when she sang the first line of the chorus and I knew IT'S GONNA BE MORE ahead and I was damn right. Touching story and music. Brilliant.

Paulo Victor	I’ve just watched the film, Is it just me or any one else think that Brad was so much more falled in love than her in the movie? I’m not judging her, I just think that Bradley Cooper’s experience is way longer... ;)
Box	Is this really his voice? I had no idea he could sing. I also had no idea Lady Gaga could actually sing and it’s not just auto-tune. I didn’t know what she even looked like without so much make-up. I guess I just don’t really know anything..
cherryketket	1st time I heard this song I was like, "no no, not gona like this one, sorry Brad, don't like your singing voice." Ffw some weeks later, am waking up with this song in my head, got the urge to listen it on repeat! 😭

Nyx	The first moment I found out that Lady Gaga made a movie I knew I had to see it. I saw it today and now I'm in love. That movie made me both cry and laugh. I love the fact that even when many people didn't believe in her, she made a very good job in the movie with Bradley. They were both awesome. I loved how Bradley portrayed his character, and how gorgeus Lady Gaga looked all natural without the blonde hair and all that crazy makeup. Their voices were on point, it was a surprise to hear Bradley's voice. I didn't think that he could sing that good. The soundtrack is beautiful, full of really good songs that I just can't get out of my head. A total masterpiece.

Marcos Rodrigues	Cara ...sério. Ela não é mais e nem menos do qualquer outra . Mas so Gaga teve tamanha coragem de sair da zona de conforto, deixando de ser um produto comercial, pra fazer e viver sua essência musical, a sua verdade artística. Ela é unica. Incomparável. A partir de hoje sou fã da arte, da determinação e da coragem.

1D and bts trash	Loved all the songs but really hated the movie man. It’s such a badly made movie.  It could’ve been so much more. People fell asleep with me in the theater.

Cora Klemmer	After seeing Lady Gaga's performance in the movie, I have greater respect for her as a person and an artist.  She's such an astounding talent!
Judith Callol	Lady gaga Looks so beautiful
TheLastDoraemon	Between 'Telephone' and this.... worlds apart.  I have a feeling that Cooper demanded Gaga to strip her makeup throughout the movie filming to turn Gaga into a character actor: basically forcing her to feel insecure the way Ally does by filming her looks without all that thick foundation and fluff which she herself seem to rely due to her own lack of confidence in her natural looks. Basically 'Ally' is Gaga if she wasnt famous.   And yes, aesthetically she looks so ordinary in the first half of the movie, but...  I find myself helplessly charmed by Gaga as Ally.   Since she' already famous now, I hope she will actually utilize her talent more and produce better music instead of the repetitive parroty trash pop she always did.
Jason Day	Cooper and Gaga nail it with this number. Love this song. Great movie. My review for more:  bit.ly/starborn2018

First of all she dropped makeup and crazy costumes years ago, second of all the makeup and costumes were just a way for her to express herself during that time, she was always talented with and without the makeup that didn’t change just because she took some makeup off! Someone out there feeling the same way lol?

Rasouza Souza	Lyrics  Tell me something, girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there something else you’re searching for?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now

Irina Stan	I Love This Sooong!!!!
Inga Günther	In an interview she said she never be more herself than in this movie.  I was never a Gaga-fan. It`s not my genre and for me she was always to cool, cold and unemotional. And now? She looks like a woman and that's not the  result of less makeup, I think. The reason is she  let her "mask" falling down?! She show real emotions, so deep emotions and they shine bright out of every fiber of her body and it looks like she is being herself in all of this tracks and in this amazing movie. So? Dear Lady Gaga, for the future: You can took so much make-up you want to, but let us see your beautiful soul in your eyes and on your face. Smile and shine bright like a star. :-) That's what you really are.
Tri Nugroho	Nice song

Armelle f	does bradley cooper really sing ?? Sorry if there's some mistakes I'm french.
TokyoTurps	Lady Gaga has stated in interviews for this movie that she was terrified because she had to have no make-up on. She was terrified because she said she is insecure about her looks which is why she wears such whacky make-up to cover it up but seriously, she doesn't need to be insecure about anything. She looks fucking amazing without her makeup. I hope she embraces this more often but its totally understandable if she doesn't seeming as her Lady Gaga persona is known for her whacky fashion sense. Maybe its just me but I think she looks really pretty without make-up and her natural hair colour.
Camilla Stenvik	HO,HO Häftigt!!!!

Andres Jake Carrillo	I love his new look, it's like he was born again, now if I like Lady Gaga for this album and some songs from the previous album Joanna and not for that garbage that was before, you're the best, for me this is your second album joanne studio and you should stop calling lady gaga, that name is only full of glamore and not of satisfaction how you have it right now, you deserve to be recognized as you are and not as the fagots want to be seen, you are the best joanne, the next album I hope it's more instrumental pop and not that crap you used to get before, I love you, keep it up, that if you lose fans to change style on the other hand you win, you do not always have to be the bitch to be better than others, you can be yourself and that's it...

I'm fallin' In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low In the sha-sha-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now  Ooooo aahaaa ooou (s) Ooo ouo oooo haaaa (s)  I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-sha-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now

Débora , JESUS CRISTO TE AMA !	Raso (part. Bradley Cooper)  Me diga uma coisa, garota Você está feliz neste mundo moderno? Ou você precisa de mais? Existe algo mais que você está procurando?  Estou caindo Em todos os bons momentos Eu me vejo almejando uma mudança E nos momentos ruins, eu tenho medo de mim mesmo  Me diga uma coisa, garoto Você não está cansado de tentar preencher esse vazio? Ou você precisa de mais? Não é difícil manter toda essa energia?  Estou caindo Em todos os bons momentos Eu me vejo almejando uma mudança E nos momentos ruins, eu tenho medo de mim mesma  Eu estou fora do limite, assista enquanto mergulho Eu nunca vou tocar o chão Caio através da superfície Onde eles não podem nos machucar Estamos longe do raso agora  No raso, raso No raso, raso No raso, raso Estamos longe do raso agora  Eu estou fora do limite, assista enquanto mergulho Eu nunca vou tocar o chão Caio através da superfície Onde eles não podem nos machucar Estamos longe do raso agora  No raso, raso No raso, raso No raso, raso Estamos longe do raso agora

It was my first time seeing everyone crying at the end of a movie. I talked to people I never seen before just because we were all so emotional while leaving LOL It was so captivating and moving.

Leydi Laura Arango	Te amoooooooo ❤
Athena P.	The movie is overrated imo. It's a tired plot and it's got nothing new to offer in 2018. The best thing about it was Gaga's voice and Bradley Cooper's performance. Gaga's acting, while admirable considering she's not an actress, was not outstanding enough to put this movie in top tier category. It's a nice film to spend your evening with, but Oscar-worthy? No.
Ted Sullivan	When you realize the song made for movies are better then modern music. We may never get the 70's, or 90's rock back, but at least good music is still being produced in some manner.
CryptoJack	i hope they sing it live on tv sometime
Harry	Me encantaaaaaaaa

Lee Gooda	I just hope that when she turns up to collect the Oscar and the Grammy that her performance and songs deserve, that she turns up how she portrays in the movie!!! Her beauty is natural and requires no gimmicks! After this era she'll never need a meat dress or all the make-up again. Be Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta from now on. Lady Gaga has had her time. This female is far better!!
Natasha Semrau	Gaga what can't she do? Act, sing, write, dance and look fabulous!!!!!! Lady Gaga is gorgeous!!!!👄💋👄💋👄💗💖💕💞💝💔💗💟❤💓💋👄💗👅💖💟💕💞💔💝💕

Larry Loew	Yes- Lady Gaga is a natural beauty.  Lady G. does not need makeup.  Lady G. has a unique and striking look.  Hard to understand the reports that Lady G. is uncomfortable with her real appearance.  She is very attractive.  I sincerely hope that Lady G. will see that truth soon.  llo3

余宗衛	Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Jay R	Watching this trailer with neutral eyes, I don't find this video or song special at all. Average song, & average looking actors. In my opinion, all  these gushings I see in the comments are only because these actors are already super famous. Let us all be fair in our judgment

Prof. André	Well, a friend of mine (a scholar and an attorney, by the way) told me these following words and, afterwards, I'm really lookiing forward to watch it!  "The movie is about a Rockstar with some drugs and alcohol problems. After a concert of him, he goes to a pub and he ends up before a lady singer WHO amazed him. At this moment, he realizes that she is a star, and he wants to look after her. The movie story happens in U.S. and the “new star” starts a tour along with her idol. It’s an endearing love story that teaches us the importance of believing in ourselves and in our dreams."  #AStarIsBorn #HighlyRecommended #LadyGagaRocks
Dorian Baccus	Amazing
Raymond Zacchaeus Arias	0:34. Her look reminded me of Scarlett Johannson as the Black Widow.

후후님	Really amazing movie  i was moved in cinema  When listening to foreign songs, Koreans usually do not know the meaning and decide that it is good for the sound or feel of the song. I would encourage such people to find and listen to what is interpreted. When I hear this song...

Prince farquaad	This song is beautiful. I got chills hearing this song for the first time. Truly amazing.
SeeThroughScreen	"Music is essentially any note between twelve octaves. Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It’s the same story told over and over. All that the artist can offer the world is how they see those twelve notes.   And he loved the way you sang them."
Emanuele Sorrentino	I'm Italian, it's a marvelous film and without makeup you're thousands of times more beautiful.  This side of you I think positively hit everyone. Great music, i love it.
Donald Kirby	She is so much prettier without all the makeup.
Vanessa Monroe	Bradley Cooper is amazing, and Lady GaGa is stunning!  💜🎶Wow! He’s an awesome singer, and she’s a fantastic actress!  GaGa is also naturally gorgeous without all the make-up and fake hair. This movie should sweep the Academy Awards! ⭐️🎉🌟
Jillian Rose	This movie broke me
Gretta Hall	I really think lady ga ga is trying 2 hard 2 b something she's not
Yvette Naomi	Okay but can Bradley cooper consider to further his music career because this is awesome
Ted Lambert	I really love how Cooper is mouthing the words to help Gaga (in character, not as if she needs help remembering lines....) "longing for" as she approaches them the first time. Look right at 133 - 135 ish and you'll see it. He's being supportive in what I guess is her first big moment on stage. Haven't seen the movie, but love the tracks.
Jaider Benavides	Magia ❤
Marie Claire	The movie was one of the best I've ever watched, the fact that it's my first time watching a musical in the theaters, and it was one of the best experience, I cried my eyes out watching it ❤❤

Emma Rowlands	I’ve not seen a star is born but I am addicted to this song

sithlordsoup	The awkward moment went Aashiqui 2 came out in 2013, but A Star is Born came out 76 years before that in 1937.  Yeah.
Luc Lordello	LENDA VIVA
jody 107	only back from the movies not a dry eye in the shop
Emily Marie	The best of part of this movie was that I completely forgot it was Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. I believed everything and a whole new respect for Bradley Cooper with the stage owning and singing.
Tony Nguyen	Lady gaga overall the most talented female singer of today... Shes a great singer, a great songwriter, dancer performer, a true musician that plays various instruments, a a good actress, and very intelligent.... Todays female singers a like rihanna, ariana grande, selena, Beyonce,  gomez, etc are a fucking joke compared to Gaga......
Kevin Boudreau	shes prettier with dark hair
Gabriellita	😩😍😍😍😍😍
Angel Matias	Linda Música! ✨💙 De La Reina del Pop 😻👑

Chi T	this song is not bad but I think you fans of lady gaga may be over estimate this song. Go listen to steve perry's new album music is better than this song. I like lady gaga but when this is getting more attention than one of the greatest singers ever, I worry about this generation of listeners. But yes its a pretty good song. Come on people be real.
Pin Gadol	Gaga no need to ever go back to all the crazy costumes. You are a natural beauty.
Jonathan Bourhis	I never liked Lady Gaga and her makeup, I like moderately songs that are certainly very good and quality with talent. But I never knew she was such a beautiful woman. In any case, it's no longer the old Lady that I know, but the fruit of a talented beauty that assumes from what we know and what is more, beautifully beautiful as a singer, actress and woman with an epic song! I do not like this type of film in the cinema but I think it's worth the candle and attracted an atypical audience
sham z	Aashiqi 2 vibes anyone??

Dydy Bdbhouston	I won’t be surprised if Bradley leaves Irina and Gaga leaves Cristiano  and they start dating cuzzzzz that motherfucking chemistry I’m seeing here . It’s called “ True Love”
Alan Hunt	Ever since I saw Stefani sing with Tony Bennett I knew she was something really special, not another popstar who would come and go and end up on that burnt out heap of trash fashion music and yes Stefani is incredibly beautiful, her very best yet and this is only another layer pealed back to a great artist. Is there nothing she can't do. I will buy all of this the minute I can get it, movie, music the lot....  The funny thing is I was never a great Lady Ga Ga fan, but I sure am a fan of Miss Germanotta at this rate she will end up as one of the all time greats, right up there with Tony Bennett and all the Gods of Music.... I bet Def Jam Recordings guitar is really weeping now.... :-).  Stefani please share your heart of music with us again... I can't wait. Tony will be proud and me too if it counts....

Definitely, one of the most beautiful works ever done.

Issy Moy	Literally just left the cinema. I am currently in tears still and the movie finished 10 minutes ago. I went with my sister and my mum. I feel like everyone who was in the same cinema as me should get a refund because I suffer from a disease called ‘I-cry-easily’, and I was sitting in the middle of the theatre crying and blubbering and sniffling, tears pouring down my cheeks I’m sure even Moses would have trouble parting my tears.
JohnCranberry23	Having seen the  movie now I kinda tear up remembering scenes in this amazing video.
Aline Skibunny	Saw the film today.  What an absolute masterpiece.  Hope gets nominated for academy awards for best movie, best actor, best actress direction and music.  Had never been interested in Lady Gaga music but, boy has she won me over.  Beautiful voice and loved her natural good looks without all the makeup.  Bradley Cooper in my opinion did a stellar job of direction, acting and loved he actually did his own singing.  What a talented man.  Would love to see it again if I get the opportunity.

Celeste Villamin	October is mental health awareness month. Addiction is very hard to fight. The message that I got from this movie is Be  kind and have patience with everyone because you never know the demons they are fighting inside.
Tammy Smith	Lady Gaga is gorgeous without makeup! I just saw the movie tonight and I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen, every single second of the film is captivating! It was an emotional ride from beginning to end. I thought no one could beat Barbara Streisand in the role, but Lady Gaga was so real, so relatable, and her voice was amazing and honest. Bradley Cooper, too, just blew me away! He is a genius!
Stephen Wong	2:45
Vibrant Lotus	I haven't stopped crying since I saw the movie....this song comforts me in a sad, sad way. I suffer with alcohol and drug addiction and everything about this movie was raw and precious. Their love story really hit home.

Milo Uribe	My respect for #ladyoscar
Ale Guzman	I loved the movie and this song was amazing !
ALAN BROWN	A lot of fuss about nothing, this is a rehash after all . Lady Gaga is over-rated and this isn't really a great acting performance because she's playing a pop star, something she should  be comfortable doing but seems rather wooden at times!

Katrina's Toy Channel	This song gives me chills!
baldeagle7777777	Don't like the song at all. 👎 I did not recognize lady Gaga without her devils suit on ? Bradley Cooper is out of time with his  lines in the song, to slow and starts singing way to late ? 👎These Hollywood celebrities don't get a free ride with me anymore, buying tickets or anything they are selling....I'm keeping my money !
Zoomy Z	It’s joel from the last of us
Andres Donaire	Me encanta
Sarah DZ	*Perfect..💗*
Rhiannon studios	Is this the real life, is this just fantasy, caught in a landslide no escape from reality, in the shallows the shall-all lows, in the shall la la la la la lows.......

Rob S	Lady Gaga doesn't have the best voice but her voice suits her to a tee, with her getting 100% out of it with each breath; great control, feel, emotion, ending with ultimate execution. She has just reinvented herself, with this time better than ever!

peargrin	This song gives me chills. Every. Single. Time.
Evelīna Marta Grinberga	I just watched it today and it was amazing, I'll be honest, I didn't know how Lady Gaga looks like since I don't pay attention. She could walk right past me and I still wouldn't notice unless she would sing. I couldn't even judge her by her looks because I only knew her voice, not her appearance. Is it bad?
Debora Moraes	Música linda 🎶 🇧🇷
Adi G	Wow she looks amazing just the way she is. Amazing singer and amazing song.
bigvdfan	She’s beautiful 😍😍😍

Дмитрий Горбатов	Потрясающе!
Anna O Riordan	Best movie I’ve ever seen
joselin briceño	Yeah are normal
Marshall Purcell	this is beautiful. I’ve always loved GaGa’s music. She’s been an inspiration for me creating my own music and playing for the LGBT+ community. She was a big help in me accepting my own queer identity and living for what makes me happy. She’s such a beautiful singer, on CD and in person. I hope to one day meet her and thank her for being that inspiration

MakinInProcess	without the mask, super hot <3.
kl bn	Every now and then there is a movie about people reach their potential to become successful and beloved singer.  I have read the happy comments about how great the movie was.  And that's right, this is a great movie, but I feel so bitter: media always make us think that we can be the ones, we recognize ourselves within the characters: desire to have self-esteem, to win against our demons, find truly love and all the people happy about our happiness.  And then you go back to your daily life, you have to find a job which actually you can make for living, you find no true love, nor talent within you.  So in the end you feel like you liked a lie. You are betrayed.
Edel casey	This song gives me so many feels.

Tuny Nguyen	I see myself in this movie it is so related to me. My boyfriend/fiancé is a drug, gambling addict. But he is a talent, romantic, loving and caring man I’ve ever met in my life. Seeing him ruining his life with drugs is tearing my heart. I tried many ways to get him out of it. Our love story was a dream how we met, how we felt in love just like a movie, every words we gave each other could write poems and I was lost and i’m now still lost in that dream, I just never want to wake up.. I hope we can hold each other hands and go through this. I love him so much

Linda Shamoun	I can not stop listening to this song and looking at this beautiful "couple". Gaga and Cooper are phenomenal in this movie.
zariqafsha	The unglamorous look of Gaga is much more beautiful than the glamorous one.. and this is the 2nd Gaga song that I have in my playlist after I’ll Never Love Again.. 😀
Daneel Olivaw	This song is infectious, there is one part of the song at between 1:46 and 1:47 where the song transitions into the chorus for the first time. It feels like there is a natural moment where the line starts, but it is delayed... by just a moment. If feels like an imperfect transition, and it grabs my attention every time; Like Ally only realizes where the song is at that moment, and decides in the moment where she is going to go with it.   like an intentional quarter beat that fits the scene and the story perfectly,  maybe this is an obvious observation, but it’s stuck with me since the movie, and every time I’ve heard the song.  Such a good movie and story, looking forward to seeing it again.
Jim Cameron	i have a bad feeling this 3. remake = no flop/XXL OSCAR movie 2019 + best  actress + directing oscars!

charlotte Jones	2:35
Nigel Sheldon	Cannot answer to Aaliyah macken's comment below or above me.....but I agree. I never even knew what Lady Gaga truely looks like and I kinda immediately loose interest in women in general when theres too much makeup it weirdly kills it for me. This was the first time I even saw what she really looks like. And I gotta say: what an attractive woman. Amazing chemistry between her and Cooper who amazed me even more. That actor is out of this world. I never knew he could sing. Seriously, when I watched that scene where they sang together on stage, this song in this video, what I thougth? I thought 'okay....somebody sang for Bradley, no way he can sing like that. So whos singing for him'? Only later did I realize its actually him. That song is beautiful the way they sing it together.
Nabilah Audah	Both of their voices together feels like a waves smashing a big rock. Contrasting each other yet feels so good when u hear them together.
Barbara Frick	Ein Mega Hammer Film, Lady Gaga und Bradley Cooper sind fantastisch! Und der Song ist der Hammer! Ich liebe ihn!

Kimchen 1976	I never would've thought that the woman is Lady Gaga if they didn't said it.
Zoé Louis	The best movie
lori ann Costello	I keep watching this video. The look of pride on his face when he watches her sing...how she wrinkles her nose, smiling, when they share the mic at the end...the sheer randomness of how they meet, how this great love was nearly a miss....I want to see the movie again, but I dont think, emotionally, I could take it again. Ive been crying over it for a week now, telling myself it’s not real, yet the feelings it evokes are among the most real.
melis ketenci	the movie was impeccable
Bilal Rabbi	Perfect slow song. Can't stop loving it more and more

Pricila Monica	"Shallow" (from "A Star Is Born" soundtrack)  [Bradley Cooper:] Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Lady Gaga:] Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga:] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Te amo gaga!! desde siempre y para siempre.

The world in clips	(A Star Is Born is an amazing movie) . It has tackled important  issues including LGBT community, black community, mental problems and the meaning of beauty. But most importantly the movie is simply an outstanding romantic love story.

Catherine Rosa	Love this song
Eason Du	This song is very, very very good.
Matthew Shea	Never really thought of GaGa as sexy.  The drag queen and unusual looks she typically wore never got me.  Whenever she looked more normal I thought she looked far better, but still not for me.  But, seeing her as a long haired brunette, she actually looks pretty sexy to me.  Probably because she seems more natural than I've ever seen her before.

ButtWait!	let's take this to #1  PLEASE, I am not Gaga fan but it's been years since i saw a song on #1 that actually deserve the 1st Position.
Lee Hwang Tran	Is it me or everytime i see Bradly Cooper i immediately imagine the Hangover guy?
Dennis Wade	I'm sorry, but this whole story has been done before, and better. Nothing new or original here.  I tried to like this song, but it just doesn't do anything for me at all. I predict that this movie will have a brief flash, and will then fade into obscurity. Only one thing stood out to me, and that was something another commenter mentioned: Lady Gaga really does look better without all that makeup.
Lekinho Leke	Brasil love u Gaga  😭😭😭😭😭  My baby
flannel head	Sorry, but leave it to Judy.

Milady L	Thank you for the movie and songs... I love them so much
wellington rodrigues	Te best Voice gaga, one Million a now!
Gary Simonson	The chemistry.   The breakout scene with "Shallow", watching her reach way down inside for the courage to get onstage.   Bradley Cooper just looked so genuinely happy for her.   And I sure enjoyed meeting (so to speak) Stefani Germanotta, who is so way more than I ever imagined.   She just comes off as someone you want to like, for who she is.  I understand the Gaga persona, but girl, you just don't need that at all.
Camel Boy	Best movie of the year! Like if you agree 👍🏼

Or do you need more Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?  [Refrain: Lady Gaga] I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now

Eden Fortnite	<3 I love the new Lady Gaga ^^ (I have a channel Fortnite for French if you want ^^)
Priscila Santos	é de arrepiar 👏👏👏
Vale Viganò	amazing job from both of them. They truly helped each other get to another level, and thats what real art does, makes people get together to climb the "stairway to heaven":)  i had seen some of his movies and  i was both appreciating his skills, and his ability to often act as a support to other film's carachter, especially the female's ones.  That requires good acting capacities, and some humility and considerable sensitivity too. At the same time, now one can see he had so much more to give, and to express.  Acting, directing, writing script and music, and even playing when it is not your job, is indeed remarkable, almost unique in that industry.  I wonder if he wasnt maybe already writing and playing in his private life.. At the same time, he did all this trough, once again, giving space and light to his partner and co-protagonist. She did an amazing job in being fresh and natural, and breathing life to the music....and to me personally her and this song are a great and beautiful surprise, considering i was never able to listen fully to any of her old songs:).(though ill have to listen tp the more recent works) The song, to me, hits either for their intense interpretation, convincing and passionate music, and meaningful lyrics. Which dont deal directly about romantic love, for once, but talk of deep, human, universal feelings, that we all can relate to, but can hardly speak about.  And thats why, being able to share these deep feelings and fears with someone, without fear, or shame, is maybe the most intense form of connection, trust (love?) between two people. But i feel there are other layers of meaning and possibile interpretation to the movie, which im thinking about, in symbolic ways....maybe others got this feeling too? On a personal note, i may be wrong certainly, but have this instinct that the actress and singer here better pays a bit of attention to the co-star. I read he is as much sensitive on set as you can dream of, but a bit more tricky outside of it.;)
Ana Ruiz	OH MY GOD!!

maltygoodness2	For those of you who find this song really familiar and somehow can't put your finger on why: well it's been eating at me for weeks and I finally remembered the original song which "shallow" samples heavily from. This was a massive hit for the great vocalist John Farnham back in the eighties. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDJMgANjLwk

Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow
Scott K	No need to read the comments. Just 1,000 people claiming to think Lady Gaga is pretty without makeup. Even though she wears heavy makeup in every scene of this movie.
Atara W.	Now that, tweens, is talent.  Beyoncé, Rhiana, Ariana take heed. This is talent.  Someone who is genuine, has an amazing fvoice and wow she can act.  Great face without all that crap on her.

Don P	Can anyone tell me why this egotistical bitch needs a movie made about her being discovered as some hidden talent/singer???? She’s Already a successful artist. Is she that self-absorbed that she needs to be the star of some predictable piece of crap like this!?  Meanwhile, there’s thousands if not millions of struggling actors who are probably twice as good if not better then she is yet she has to hog all the spotlight, how fucking insecure can one person be!?! I wish she would just go away for good and save us from having to be subjected to her mediocre talents!!!! Elle King is 10 times a better singer than this stupid twat could ever be!

Miki hanne	Oração poderosa Maria Padilha – chamar alguém, amor Salve Pomba Gira Maria Padilha das sete encruzilhadas! Atrás de mim você (colocar as inicias dele ou dela), vai vir de rastros, apaixonado e manso.  Salve Pomba Gira Maria Padilha Rainha das sete encruzilhadas! Dizendo assim: conheço a tua força e o teu poder, te peço que me atenda o seguinte pedido:  Oração poderosa Maria Padilha-chamar alguém, amor Que (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) não coma e não durma, não beba, não trabalhe, não consiga se divertir, que ele fique triste, deprimido e só pensando em mim, se não estiver ao meu lado.  Que seu corpo queime de paixão por mim. (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) que seu desejo por mim o deixe cego para outras mulheres. Que nenhum outra consiga fazer com que sinta prazer, somente eu terei esse poder.  Que (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) deixe de vez todas as outras mulheres que tiver na rua, e em casa tome ódio e raiva delas e não procure mais nenhuma outra que não seja eu.  Que (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) me procure a todo instante, hoje, agora, desejando estar ao meu lado. E que me tenha em seus pensamentos o tempo todo.  Agora com quem estiver, onde estiver ele (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) irá parar, porque o seu pensamento está em mim, ele irá ficar louco de paixão e ficará com os pensamentos somente em mim.  Neste momento, peço a ti, minha Rainha Maria Padilha das sete encruzilhadas, que faça (colocar as inicias dele ou dela), ficar louco de paixão por mim.  Ele ficará louco de vontade de estar comigo, de me abraçar, me beijar e me amar como nunca amou nenhuma mulher. E ao deitar, ao acordar, tenha sonhos comigo, fazendo assim com que se apaixone cada vez mais por mim.  Peço ajuda a ti, minha Rainha Maria Padilha das sete encruzilhadas, que faça (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) me achar linda, me achar gostosa e achar o meu corpo lindo e fique louco por mim, sinta muitos ciúmes também.  Que (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) sinta prazer somente por ouvir minha voz. Faça ele sentir por mim uma paixão fora do normal, como nunca sentiu por outra e nunca sentirá.  Peço a ti, minha Rainha Maria Padilha das sete encruzilhadas, que me torne uma mulher muito boa de cama, fogosa, atraente, sedutora, sexy.  Me dê o poder de conquistar a todos os homens que eu quiser, e que eu leve (colocar as inicias dele ou dela) à loucura, quando estivermos nos amando, que ele sinta todas as emoções que jamais sentirá com outra(o).  Que nós dois possamos nos amar loucamente, como ele nunca fará com nenhuma outra mulher, que a gente sempre consiga se completar, um ao outro.  Agradeço a você, por estar junto de todos os outros trabalhando a meu favor. Vou divulgar seu nome em troca deste pedido, de trazer (colocar as inicias dele ou dela), muito apaixonado, carinhoso, fiel, romântico e amável comigo.  Obrigado minha Rainha Maria Padilha das sete encruzilhadas, confio em teus poderes e quero que estejas sempre junto de mim, me tornando uma mulher muito linda, jovem, delicada, amada, soberana e querida por todos, como ti. Peço que abra meus caminhos e ajude-me a conseguir tudo que eu quero, principalmente o amor de (colocar as inicias dele ou dela), com urgência e rapidez.  Muito obrigada por tudo. Seja minha guardiã todos os momentos. E me ajude financeiramente também

許嘟嘟	Hello Goddess  I hope you are well.  I am a huge fan from Taiwan and I am a gay man.   Currently the Taiwanese LGBT community are working very hard to legalize gay marriage and Taiwan is having marriage equality referendum on 24/11/2018. However, Taiwan, which is an Eastern country, is a relatively conservative country and  we have always encountered great opposition in the fight for human rights for the LGBT community. The resources of the religious and political parties intend to persecute the progress of the human rights of the LGBT community, and even using smear campaigns. The LGBT community Taiwan are relatively small and we lack the large resources that our opposition possesses. We are encouraging support from all walks of life but especially influential people to stand up and speak for us.  I want to ask if you could record a short video in support and encouragement of our fight for equality and to let more people know, regardless of gender, age, color, religion, etc. or other various reasons, we are all the same in love! !  It is our hope that if Taiwan wins the marriage equality referendum then there is also hope for the rest of Asia.  We love you very much. Xoxoxo from Taiwan.

Ellen Morrissy	Run, do not walk, to the nearest theater and watch this movie.  It has everything.  Tremendous acting on both Bradley and Gaga's part, awesome music and singing, and a truly believable love story.  You have to experience the chemistry between the 2 leads to believe it.  I went in not expecting it to live up to the Streisand version but it totally blew it away.  Truthfully, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  If Bradley doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, then the Oscars are a joke.

Suléman Aslam	Oh boy what a voice. Cooper seriously think about an album 😍

Michael Rawson	Once in a while, but very rarely, something comes along that gets everything absolutely right, to the tiniest detail. Can't speak for the film, as I haven't seen it yet, but I will. However, for now, this song is that molten gold shining moment of utter beauty. Flawless... utterly flawless... breathtaking.
Patr Di	Me lo vedo domani al cinema 😙😙😍
LazyNinja Tv	Who else keeps clicking play again, Lady Gaga you have captured the heart of millions
Gustavo Martins	Second time watching, second time crying.
Kimberly Crittenden	I've seen both the movie and listened to all the songs over and over.  Both of these stars did a wonderful job.  I would go see it again but don't go without your tissues.  I had never seen any of the other movies and I am glad.  I can't get over the fact that all the singing was live and was them actually singing.  I preferred the earlier performances much better though  because they allowed for her to just sing and not add all the extra drama to her shows.
Reynaldo Balmes	Best movie I have seen in a long time. I cried and tried to hold it back and ended up with a sore throat. Still tear up watching this video.   Thank you Lady Gaga for being a part of this Movie. I can’t think of anyone that would have done it better and I wasn’t a big fan of yours before. I am now though. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 🙏
Jack Offer	Like this ......

Karina Espinoza	i can believe this  music . its is remmarcable moment in my live. you are amazing lady
Stephanie Blonshine	I was never a huge fan of "lady Gaga"..yes, I enjoyed her music but I never took her too serious because of all the gimmicks and media publicity..that made her who she was... However, the past few years her music has grown  she has really come a long way I feel that Lady Gaga isn't really who she is anymore...her name kind of was a cover to her soul...she used the name for protection ..so that she could keep others from truly seeing her ... she is very talented.... This is just an opinion....her past music was good...but the last few albums you can really feel her soul....she seems to still be protecting herself but she is slowly ripping away the bandages...and letting us in to see Stephanie.(Stefanie...not sure which name spelling she uses...)   I am a huge fan of Stefanie's..she has an EXTREMELY beautiful voice..her soul is just as beautiful..   Just wondering who you like Number 1 for Gaga Number 2 for Stefanie And why

Antóniocarlos do Rosário	40.286.676 : Diga-me menina..... Você está feliz neste mundo moderno?  Ou você precisa de mais?  Existe algo mais que você está procurando?  Eu estou apaixonada.  CORO: Em todos os bons momentos, eu encontro procurando por  mudanças, e nos meus maus momentos eu me temo.  Diga-me algo menino. Você está cansado de preencher este vazio? Você precisa de mais? Não é difícil mantê-lo tão incondicional?  CORO:  Eu estou sempre fora do fim profundo. Assistir como eu mergulho... Eu nunca vou conhecer o terreno Eu estou longe do raso agora. Quebrar a superfície onde eles não podem nos machucar. Estamos bem longe do raso agora

Moo Moo Puppy	The only part of that song thats kinda iffy is the sha-la-la-la--la-la-la-dows part. This movie was really great, but I need to see it again to get things straight at the end. I'm still having a hard time trying to understand why Jack(son) did what he did. I went back and watched the Barbra version to see what the difference is between the two and I see how specific things in the Gaga version came from. I'll go ahead and watch the Judy Garland verison next. I did like how the most recent version dealt with a very relevant topic.

You're adorable....saw the movie and your voice brought goosebumps all over me!  I never was into you before...except I do like Poker Face song!  Lol. I would love it if you toned it down some and I bet there are millions that would agree. The film was beautiful. You have a natural exotic face....don't cover with all the makeup .. I know I'm older but I know what I like....Judy...phase into a more natural look...Stefani..
Matheus Lucas	MEU AMOOOOOOOR!!! <3

I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Lady Gaga:] Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga:] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Aihik Sur	Bradley Cooper's voice reminds me of Beck
cndvst	2:46 was the first bit I heard of this song in the trailer for the film. It's also my favourite bit in the whole song: just the power behind the end of the song there. Kind of makes it weird to think this song starts out so chilled and relaxed.

By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.Proverbs 16:6 Jesus says in Luke 13:3, "I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. 　 One night a man had a dream. He dreamed  he was walking along the beach with the LORD. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonging to him, and the other to the LORD. When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about it: "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me." The LORD replied: "My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you."

Alan Rogelio	Una verdadera obra de arte. Me encanta que cada vez más personas se den cuenta del talento que tiene Lady Gaga, mucha gente la tachaba de loca y una artista del montón, sin embargo hasta la gente mayor comienza a apreciarla como una verdadera artista. México te ama Gaga, y Bradley ha demostrado que puede cantar espectacular.

D M	For everyone saying the soundtrack should get a grammy, I'm sorry but that's not gonna happen. The deadline for music to be released in order to be considered for a grammy is September 30. Although, Shallow was released 3 days before (coincidence? i think not) the rest of the tracks were released October 5th. Therefore, the soundtrack cannot be considered for a grammy. HOWEVER, Shallow definitely can! FINGERS CROSSED!

hfxmusicman	Just hearing this song today for the first time. I like it. Not a huge GaGa fan, like a few of her songs. After watching this, I think she needs to rethink the blonde hair and stay with her natural look. It suits her. She looks and sounds incredible.

Or do you need more Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?  [Refrain: Lady Gaga] I'm fallin’ In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Ooooo aahaaa ooou (s) Ooo ouo oooo haaaa (s)  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now

Jonzer Style	lady gaga songs to me were like poker face until I stumbled on this one.  really like it.  very classy sound, from the heart delivery, this song is a classic in my book.  one of my favorites!  lady plays the part to get exposure but she is a good old fashion lady when it comes to music at heart.  keep playing from the heart and we will always  love you - never stop!  bradley is great too.  wouldnt be the same with out the male counterpart, really nice.
Brandon	OSCARS ARE FALLING FROM THE SKY OOMMGG ITS AMAZING
hải nguyễn khắc	Grammy and Oscar has a fucking winner :3
IvyLeague	Such an emotional song! I cry when I hear it. Its funny how one song of 3-4 minutes can take you on a journey and convey such human emotion. Regardless of people's opinions, Gaga will be one of the greatest artists of our generation (millennials). I remember Poker face becoming a hit my freshman year of college to her then paparazzi performance at the VMA awards when I was a sophomore (chillingly good). Watch her documentary on Netflix and be inspired to not be a troll on the internet and live a fully expressed authentic life :)

WaterfallGoddess 89	Oscar Worthy Film & Song!!!! Who Agrees??? Let me know
Yusaini Samat	As a cover musician, I've played some of Lady Gaga's songs with my bands for many years but when I watched this great movie last week, it was the FIRST time I actually saw this multi-talented lady without her elaborate wigs, costumes, make-ups, etc...beautiful song, definitely doing a cover duet on this with my singer very soon
Panamera	This is the best part of the movie
Wh4T's Up E-Sport	I'm Thai Fan. She is very Special ❤️

ItsClaresLife	I just watched the movie and now listening to this song makes me cry! 🤧
Angel Vladimir Ramirez	beautifull😢❤
MsJackjack2010	Beautiful song, im in tears.
Kerry B	Love him scruffy, and love her look in this song.. she's beautiful. I never listened to her sing before because of the pop music and crazy outfits and make up. She is an incredible singer and so is he. I' saw the movie and cried my eyes out.  New fan here... I was blown away.
James Weirick	At 1:55 when Lady Gaga covers her eyes with her hands, this video transcends a trailer. That’s amazing and true emotion.
Luke Scott	stefani i love you forever!
kimfaithchurch	Incredible movie!  Bradley Cooper should get Best Actor for this role and Lady Gaga was awesome! Such a good, authentic story.

zain shaikh	Masterpiece❤
Christopher Migliore	This song is a lock for best original song at the Oscars.  No doubt.  The soundtrack has already been critically acclaimed, even by Rolling Stone magazine, which is insane.  The song even charted in the top 40.
paul brandano	I am not a Bradley Copper or Lady GaGa fan but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I am a Led Zeppelin, Al Pacino type of guy but went to go see this movie and while trying to fight back the tears I began wondering why I was so sensitive to this film and  realized Its about all of us. The beauty of beginning to fall in love,  Being in love,  That love begin to be threatened for whatever reason and suddenly things begin and cracks appear and our feet begin hitting the ground again ( love )  We yearn to feel it again and reminisce what we once had and we want the 2 hearts that beat as one to be whole again to the time we lifted each other up and completed one another.  These are some of the many thoughts I felt while watching this. It is the story of all our lives,  Being  a star in the one you love's eyes is much more powerful than being a star through Millions of eyes. If the one you love and cherish and the one that makes you feel complete begins to slip and fall you feel as if everything has come unglued.   My apologies for babbling but these are the many thoughts and emotions I felt watching this movie and then thinking about my own experiences with falling in love.  It was so real life this movie and yes,  I cried and more than once and you know what? For some strange reason I feel as If some untapped love and untapped hurt poured out of me from my experiences in life and if my tears from this movie were transferred to film, I would see the moments that conjured those feelings from my own life that brought me to tears. This movie was real life,  Now, Me being single and alone makes all of the feeling I felt from this movie more beautiful even if they hurt and even if I had to re live some of my life all over again LOVE was all worth it.   - Paul in Massachusetts

Rafael Beckman	Just watched a star is born and it’s so freaking good. Honestly what Gaga can’t do? She’s so talented and the movie itself reminded me of her own story as an artist. Her beginning, people criticizing her looks, her pop success; this role fits her so well. If she gets an (well deserved) Oscar nomination I’m gonna be happy for her and shook at the same time.

Rio Cehajic	Most amazing movie ever!!!! Bradley cooper and Lady Gaga you guys were so incredible and REAL!!!! Definitely going to see that movie again.
Shayak Bose	Till now Bradley Cooper was remembered as the hot and funny guy from "The Hangover". After this movie, he'll be remembered as one of the legends who re-captured the feel and tone of the original movie and without the cheesiness that prevails in the adaptations of "A Star is Born". I'll be sad if he doesn't get a nomination in 2019 Oscars.

ӔLIS	You know what's the bad thing of this song? It's too short
NewtNukem	Ive never been a fan of lady Gaga and all that over the top shock factor design to get peoples attention most pop stars do.   But this film was amazing and really liked this version of lady gaga, down to earth country looking/singing high voiced superstar. An ive never actually seen Lady Gaga without all her makeup and weird costumes but shes actually really good looking in this film. Mainly at the start before she comes that over top pop Princess again Lol.   But defo one my favorite films of this year from just pure acting and film progression. It never goes the cliquesha route of where bradley becomes jealous of all success it stays true to the point that they both have there real problems but still truly believe in each other.
Sevinj Jafarli	Is there only Bradley cooper singing version of this song ?

Midknte	Amazing.
Moogie B	I agree she looks like an angel without makeup and her natural hair. Sweet girl.  Keep running from the Hollywood demons kids. Yikes. Call out to Jesus. They fear him and will leave if you command them to in his name.

Matt Brooke	I think I love this song so much coz bradley coopers voice is almost something new to me, or its not the voice/accent my brain predicts for the genre I dunno... its just so damn refreshing!! At the same time its moving and emotional and deep. Really spoke to my love of vocal performance which suprised me considering last I saw brad was The Hangover movies. Well done bradley cooper, and thankyou. Lady gaga punched straight to my heart from the first note but no suprises there!! All round an awesome piece of art imo.

Fernando pessoa	I love eu amei
otakurocks	People only realizing gaga's talent now are so basic and predictable. If couldn't realize it before and it was necessary for gaga to smear it on your face, then you're the problem, it doesn't matter what crazy shit gaga has done, behind the meat dress, the talent was always there. Your lack of capability to understand how talent works, is the problem.
Vanie Bee	Tell me somethin', girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah! I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now
Matt Ramos	I'll probably be attacked but whatever. This song and movie are both overrated. The only selling point of the song is when lady gaga really goes for it toward the end. While the selling point of the movie is by far gaga's number in the club.
Laura Poffenberger	I've watched this 200 times
David Altena	probably watch this like 50 times and it still make me tear up

John Rana	I was thinking it might be her own true to life story.. on the first jam, they knew thet like each other and they became together.. after they broke up, and lady gaga, continue singing and became famous and the guy’s career suddenly gone.. i think this is a very good movie.. i cant wait for it...

Dibil Idiot	lady flopga
Ghost Meister	ooooaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
The Darndest Things	It’s weird because IIRC Lady Gaga then Stephanie Germanotta was an extra in The Sopranos. She was maybe high school age. So she had to become a megastar singer to be taken seriously as an actress. Life takes us on some strange and unexpected routes. You Just never know what’s gonna happen. Hang on tight, y’all.
GetCashMob856	This song is beautiful. I cried 5x listening to it and in the theatres as well, this movies deserves an Oscar in many categories.

Lara F.	I watched the movie in the cinema yesterday and had tears in my eyes. Before the movie, Lady Gaga was known only to me as a woman with crazy hairstyles and outfits. I have never seen such a beautiful woman without make up and with natural hair color. Lady Gaga's voice is just the absoulte insanity and I could watch the movie again and again. Lady Gaga is so good at acting but Bradley Cooper was great too! Too bad that the movie ends so sad. One of the best films of 2018! Congratulations Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper I would like to see more movies of you two. Please stay so natural Lady Gaga that suits you best. You have produced such amazingly beautiful songs together. Thanks for this great achievement ❤️❤️❤️

I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah!  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Anthony Dsilva	Please upload all music videos of this film
Norman lol	Omg😍😍😍😍
Mykel Pickens	I was never a Gaga fan but something about this movie resonates with me. Maybe it’s the country rock vibe, the music in it is amazing, Even the crappy pop that Gaga’s character is “forced” into. Overall this movie speaks some life lessons. I’m just glad I was born with minimal musical talent, otherwise I would have ended up a Jackson Maine.
trina margarett nonato	Bradley Coopeeeer 😍😍😍😍

il meglio del cinema	With Hereditary best movie of the year
Jorge Márquez	This movie, in a way, can be seen as a critique to Lady Gaga's carreer. Before being Lady Gaga (the character), she played piano and sang songs that showed the crowd how talented she was. Then, she became a plastic artist and started losing her essence, singing lyrics with no meaning and becoming someone totally different to who she was.
Freya Davidson	This movie is so moving😰😭 I love lady Gaga!❤️🧡
Walisson Martins	Beautiful music 💓

randomanimelover	WHY?! This movie made me cry do much! Especially the ending. The way they act together is wonderful!
Greek Greasy	This song really represents a woman coming into her own and how it's a bittersweet love story about two people with their own demons, as seen in the shots of Ally and Jackson getting close, but also falling apart. the song gives us a stripped down look at fame and the toll it can take on a person and those they love. such an emotional and amazing song. thank you gaga and cooper

FEEZE FAVI	When I finish listening to Shallow, I go and see the trailer of A Star is Born to relive that emotion that I felt when I heard that small part of the song. I don't stop listening to this song and I can't stop singing the chorus!!!!!
Alfredo Jimenez	She is really one of the best voices ive ever heard in music, she deserves to be in the top ten singers of all times, and she looks so beautiful without all the make up.
Jenna Hart	Just beautiful in her own unique way which makes us special and unique.  She’s  a doll. 💕❤️👍🏻
Martina Javorská	Okey, I've really tought that Gaga was great in American Horror Stories: Hotel, but this is amazing 😮
Carlos Lopez Ramirez	I love it
Anindya Gessyela	Dengerin lagunya hafalin sambil nunggu filmnya keluar di indonesia 😍
Mark Stahl	This version may be too similar to the 1976 version and Bradley Cooper looks more disheveled with certainly none of the   smoldering sexiness vibe that Kris Kristofferson gave off in 1976, drunk or not. Kris was in shape. Bradley cooper just looks  middle aged with a beer belly.
V N	This is the exact storyline like Ashiqui2
Rafael Gonzalez Gutierrez	I just watched the movie and i can only say that it's amazing and sad at the same time. Oscar material for me
Narci Garci rui	Buena actuación de Bradley, la música me gustó, poder en algunas. Vocal de Gaga buenísima.

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

We are all longing for more richness, more beauty, more honesty in life, and this movie seems so real, so raw, and so human!

CcelordeChristopher Chin	Sounds a little like A Million Reasons by Lady Gaga like if you agree

fei23k	so many singers trying to act or get into a movie business... but I gotta say...I never see gaga act before, but man she's hella impressive!! not only she acts great but it's like a story of herself... like how for people like me, not a fan of gaga before, never know she can sing like this... never know how she looks like when she has no makeup... but it's all changed from this movie...the moment she gets screwed up by her manager to be the pop star it's just like how she came out with the poker face style... and she's back this simple pure gaga with a movie of another gaga... what a cycle of life and amazing movie there!!!!
Marina Abella	I was dumbfounded by Bradley Cooper that he sing so well.

david ducovny	First half of the movie is awesome,and  one of the best country rock music ever ,Second half is GARBAGE  and  Depressing,the trailer is made out of first part mainly,the worst part of this movie is when LADDY GAGA TURNS INTO A DANCE STAR  instead of keep making duos with bradley. Bradley Cooper takes the easy way out in the end , HE 's a coward

Irini k	Love from Greece 💟 is my favourite song💟
Juanka Abg	The movie😍
Lisa Marciano	Seriously such an amazing song and two amazing performers.  You haters should just stop.  There is so much passion in this song. The movie itself was great. It dealt with issues currently at hand, but have always been around, the disease of alcoholism and drug abuse.  And love, at the core, was the message.  Love cant conquer a disease and that’s not the message.  The message is sometimes we lose people to a disease and we have no control.  How do we change that?  No idea.  And again haters just stop. Stop hating.  Please
Asia Chmiel	❤️

greg22bg	Holly hell, I do damn love this Gaga...not the other one!! It's amazingly fabulous listening to her singing like that! Keep this way!!
Lordhart Paul	For those who don't know it's a remake of an Indian movie "ASHIQUE 2" which is completely based on songs and has won numerous awards. Bradley cooper will struggle finding his fame back as he was a popular singer and soon become a victim of depression and eventually dies. But he helps Lady Gaga build her career in music industry as she possesses talent is not the actual reason he fell in love with her on his first sight. So the bottom line is it's full of emotions, heart touching songs and is definitely going to win OSCARS.
banderalo100	i loved this song is beatiful

sam nzm	Tell me somethin', girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah!  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

I've already watched the movie twice. I'll watch it for a 3rd time this weekend. I loved every bit. Such chemistry, the respect I saw towards each cast member... Superb performances by all of you. Bradley is an exceptional director. I hope you will be able to work with him again <3  I am so glad that I live in this era and have the chance to see you bloom in this way. You are only 32... I bow to you Gaga \m/

silentype 20	Lady gaga is so gorgeous without those props and exaggerated make ups. I love her in this . 😘😘
Kara Mellott	I cannot get this movie out of my mind! Not only is the film and its music amazing, but I was so happy to see two artists I’m already such a big fan of come together in such a magnificent way. Witnessing Bradley become a singer and Lady become an actress was really something to see. They each took a major risk with this project and it paid off in a big way. I couldn’t be more happy for them!
Karma	This chick can sing!!!! Her and Sia seem to be leading the way at the moment...
M P	Oh man, I teared up and got goosebumps from this....truly beautiful. I've been a fan of Gaga for years, I'm glad more people are realizing how talented she actually is.

Useless-Day	We all cry at the end of the movie.
pikolina	I think I have to go back to the theatre and see it again. and again. and the a couple more times. Can't really understand why everyone is surprised Lady Gaga is such a good actress. What really surprised me was how Bradley Cooper transformed from a suburban dad to a greater-than-life rockstar. I would most definitely pay to see him in concert!

María Paz Palacios	There’s something so special about her
Adonis Niro	This is so powerful. I just found myself tearing up 🖤🖤🖤
Thomas Cunningham	This is one of my favorite songs of my life. When Brad sung it was like listening to that inner Alpha speak to the child in the soul of a man. Then when Lady Gaga hit that line " Aren't you tired tryna fill that void ........or do you need more? .....Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore ......I'm falling " that sound like the woman speaking to that inner man saying Yes I know you're a Protector but I know all you want is peace from the wars. Something in your soul as a man should of dropped when they both hit the Shallow notes together. Notice he let her shine FIRST then came in as the protector to safely land each note letting her know he has her back both musically & in life. This movie can teach you so much. Powerful
estepahanie cervantes	He is perfect .
Bạc Sỉu	Tell me something boy :))))
Jerrod P	This song and particular scene in the movie was shocking.  You truly believe she is a young singer finding her voice on stage.  She can act.

Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah! I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Her face has a big changes 2008-2018 10 years, when Gaga started her debut album The Fame with her single Just Dance, Poker Face, LoveGame, and Paparazzi, during that time I dont like her beauty, but I really like Gaga looks during Joanne Era to Star Is Born, hopefully Gaga will closer near to God, fame is not important

RedZeshinX	Hard to believe this is Lady Gaga.  Moving away from her over-the-top spectacle Madonna-emulating pop to this mature, inspired, defiantly human and womanly persona is such a 180 my head is still spinning.  In my eyes this transforms her from being merely another ephemeral bells-and-whistles stage performer to a genuine artist, crafting music that MEANS something carved straight from her soul.

David Pietarila	I get that Lady Gaga is Lady Gaga and her music and style are her own, and she has every right to be HER.  But this shows that has it in her to appeal to WHOLE other generation that grew up on classic rock.  The work she did with Tony Bennett, and now this... there is a vast, barley tapped audience out there dying to hear HER with a little less “show”.
Anaïs Nayet	Wow i love it

Andreas Tillmann	Es ist ein sehr sehr schöne Lied. Einfach nur super und genial. Ich wusste nicht das Bradley Cooper so eine tolle Stimme hat. Es passt richtig gut in dieses Lied. Vor allem die tolle Stimme von Lady Gaga passt auch sehr gut in dieses Lied. Leider habe ich den Film noch nicht gesehen. Aber ich freue mich sehr darauf den Film im Kino zu sehen.   It is very much a very nice song. Just really and brilliantly. I did not know Bradley Cooper thus a great voice has. It fits really well in this song. Above all the great voice of lady Gaga also fits very well in this song. Unfortunately, I have not seen the film yet. But I am glad very much to see on it the film in the cinema.

Antonio Carlos Franck Alves	I speak from Brazil ... I'm thrilled here with all the bristling body hairs (And look how the version of Barbra Streisand & Kris Kristofferson lives in my heart, eyes and ears to this day ...) Wonderful Gaga & Cooper, what a talent! Cheering for all the "Oscars", who are sure to come. A fan's affectionate kisses !!!
Nogirl .whatsoever	I haven't watched the movie yet and I haven't heard this song. It was in a "mix" playlist and I was just working and listening to this in the background and thought "wow, this girl has so much emotions" and then I opened Chrome and saw it was Lady Gaga! And then I reminded myself of what she said in Tyler Oakley's video and the feels hit me again and I cry! And I have no idea what the movie is about!  How does she bring so much emotions? Well done Lady Gaga!
Sharon Mickey	love the movie!! xxoxoxoxoxoxox
Mags Covers	Watching this after having seen the film changes the whole experience ;-;
ksir	My wife and I saw the movie two nights ago.  We're still talking about it and I've listened to the soundtrack over and over.  If Lady Gaga does not win the Oscar this year, I will swear off the show forever.

Tyler Kenny	Bradley coopers voice is powerful
Антон Федорыцев	Ребята, инфа 100%!!!!! Гагу играет Безруков в роли Высоцкого!!!! То есть Безруков одновременно пребывает Высоцким, считая себя на гастролях в Узбекистане и при этом играет Гагу, которая будучи бабой, по законам жанра обязана давать этому папаше в течение всего фильма. Это новые технологии в тандеме с работой гримеров и пластических хирургов сумели достичь таких поразительных эффектов. До премьеры никому ни слова!

Izabel Goncalves Leal	Tell me something, girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there something else you’re searching for?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now

Rinzler :.	Its a dam shame how the industry can just fu%! things up. In my opinion his alcoholism wasn’t that bad, he was still a productive, reputable artist. I believe he was drinking again because he was depressed about losing his hearing. He didn't tell anybody it was getting worse, even though they knew about his condition. I also believe that he didn't agree with the pop machine and selling your soul to the devil (manager). Jack knew she was special and highlighted her music in his concerts, eventually making her be famous herself on her own with him, showing her the path. She was good for him, they were good for each-other. Unfortunately we live in a narcissistic society where it's even hard to be or stay in love with someone, even if there your soulmate because of the evils out there. Evils taking advantage seeing only money and you seeing the positive things you can do with your life, and how happy your are to pursue your dream of being happy making money doing what you love. Survival of the fittest but how can one survive, if everyone is busy screwing each other.  This movie is an instant classic, and so is the soundtrack and some of it's songs. Thanks Brad, stay focused man, cause like you said in one of your interviews, it can only go down from here, but I don't think so bro, just keep kicking ass and rocking baby.

Phương Thảo Nguyễn	No more words. PERFECT!!
Kimberly Polley	I’ve never heard or seen GaGa so raw...I have always been a fan her music but this is talent beyond measure! Now I really hate when she’s compared to Madonna! Madonna has a self seeking talent,Gaga has a god given one,& boy you can sure see the difference! See ya Madonna!! Your useless talent has now been figured out by millions who now see what real talent is..Having a cocky mouth and disrespect for others isn’t “IN” anymore🤨

The Round 3 Downer	i cried to this movie.
Stephanie Lyons	My brother took his life in a similar way almost a year ago... Needless to say, I had to literally leave the theater to bawl. I didn't expect it because I am usually pretty strong, and can avoid internalizing these things. Brad's character was so relate-able and like-able, that I felt like I fell into that pit of depression with him, willing him to climb his way out. Suicide snatched him up, in that short, fleeting, moment when nobody was watching - that's also the way it happens in real life. The people you love dearly leave you in a blink. People need to talk more about preventing suicide. #StopSuicide

Alanys Lin	Amazing...a parte 2:28 do vídeo amo (i love)
DYKWINNING	*spoilers*      If only jack was able to explain how much Ally becoming commercial hurt him. She started making junk generic music that's when he went off the deep end with drinking and drugs. He wanted her for the true authentic version of her, someone different than all the phonies in the industry. It teaches not to romanticize anyone, understand we all have different wants and have major faults
Travis Williams	Love it
Lily of the Valley	02:27 - 02:44 How Gaga yawns

kendyl shaughnessy	She’s so pretty like actually wtf
David Guy	Seeing how Ally was so scarid to come on stage at first you could see and hear the nervousness in her voice because she was unsure of herself...GAGA did a fabulous job showing that which helped the audience connect with her character,root for her and cheer orr her accomplishments and have their hearts ripped out in the end right along with her.So many singers think they can also act in this case GAGA can to me this performance us Oscar worthy omg tge final scene where she is singing thru tears had the audience in tears...Bravo.

Keyser Sozie	Review. Time. I was compelled to see this movie because I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliot, and Lady Gaga. Everyone was great, but I'm floored by how infinitely talented Lady Gaga is... I thought this was just a singer doing a movie,,, I have to say she was outstanding.     I'll admit when she first appeared on the scene, I thought her act was all flash and gimmicks. But it's not. Shes the real McCoy!! Her voice is incredible,  the range. And when she sings the light in her burns brighter then the Sun!!😎    Shes completely gorgeous,,, with out make up,, she has a perfect little body, (I'm partial to petite women, my Ex wife is 5'2"), she has an incredible personality from what I've scene....    How could you not fall in love with her.????     Please see the movie. You won't be disappointed!!

Akash Goodoree	Great film. Some extremely well thought out music and story directio. It was very impressove. I hope this raw emotion carries a momentum. If something good ca come out of Hollyweirds fall some connection to our collective experiennce of living in a very strange world. I didnt thinnk this film would hit home there was some truth in this film. A rarity . Well done.
Purple Rain	I Love me some GAGA, but i can't help but point out, that She has really fucked up her face!! Idk if its Botox or something else, but its starting to not look cute!! she should stop that right know, and if possible reverse the effect and get,  her natural features back! she looks swollen and losing facial expression!
Iva Gosnjak	I love this song and this movie... i cried sooo much bout it... i wanna cry right now... i love you Lady Gaga i love your work and your songs... one day i WILL be an actress not because i "wanna be famous" because i wanna tell something to people and i love evrithing about music,acting,art... and i say to all the "crazy" people that are reading this:always be yourself, never give up of that that you are!!!!! And stop saying "I wish..." start saying "I WILL..."

Marsi P	The song has been in my suggestions for two days and I kept skipping as I've never been a Gaga fan. Finally decided to click on  out of curiosity and fell in love with the song from the first minute! Figuring out it's from a movie, watched the trailer and later the same day I was at the cinema, buying a ticket to see it. I've never been so excited to see a movie and so quick to go to the cinema! Lady Gaga, if you are reading this, know that you look amazingly beautiful without make up and all the crazy clothes. What you have is far more than a talent and a natural beauty! The brown and the ginger hair colour suits your face and eyes so well and gosh! What a voice you have! ♥ This song is on repeat for the past 4 days and I just can't get enough of it! ♥

Max Allen	How much do you want to bet that this is  going to win best original song from the Oscars
Emily Simcoe	It's 2AM and I just got home from the movie. I can't help but feel inspired by Bradley Cooper. But beyond being inspired I feel a bit hopeless because ppl like Bradley Cooper are one in thousands and I don't think I'm one of those ppl. That perfect combination of talent and dedicated perseverance. I mean who else can learn how to sing (in an accent!!), play the guitar, become a director, screenwriter, and song writer in the course of a film? There's a saying in Chinese popularized by a film about how short life is asking, "how many tens of years are in a lifetime" and I came home thinking, how can Bradley Cooper in his few tens of years accomplish so much in his lifetime? I'm blown away by the film and the sheer talent that brought this film to life.

Виктория Дарсигова	Я просто в шоке, насколько смысл этой песни перекликается со всем, происходящим в фильме. "мне не достичь дна" - это не только погружение в события, но и алкоголизм, где ему никогда не достичь дна бутылки. С английского "feet the ground" - еще значит "коснуться земли" , или "приземлиться". И когда главный герой повесился, было жутко, ведь Элли практически предсказала такой исход: он никогда не коснётся ногами земли. Низкий поклон за такие саундтреки. Never love again, правда, заметно, что писался для Бейонсе.

Doretcys Garcia	Tell me somethin', girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? I'm falling In all the good times I find myself Longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now Oh, oh, oh, oh Whoah! I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Chett Smith	I've always loved lady gaga but seeing her without any makeup she is absolutely beautiful. I can't say enough good things about her and what about Bradley Cooper thank you sir for putting together this movie and showing Lady Gaga in a different light and also showing us just how truly talented you are as a singer and an artist
Joaquin Lopez Rascon	Wow no puedo Creerlo 😍😍
Joyciane Firmo	Viciada nessa música ❤
Lorena Mendes	Como tem gente que não gostou da música? SOCORROOOO
Adriloves 03	I just realized bradley is taken heartbroken they would be such a great couple💔
Shelly Holley	We just got home from going to see A Star is Born. This role would have had to wait for you, Lady Gaga. I’ve always thought you were so brave....the way you you’ve always put yourself out there, inspiring confidence in your fans. But this role....you put yourself out there more raw and exposed than ever.  And you’ve never been more beautiful. I’m so, so proud for you. No one else could have taken the “Ally” role. It was yours before it was written. And Bradley Cooper....That long hair, the beard and those piercing blue eyes...how he fell for Ally....How he pushed her to find her voice and the beauty within herself.  You two carry the original story over into new decade and create a legendary remake that will not be soon forgotten. I can’t say enough how much I enjoyed the movie...laughing, crying and holding my breath with you all the way through. Thank you both.

Mohamad Fadly Ali	https://youtu.be/CSfceldH-tw
Jay Billz	Cooper did an awesome job directing this movie. He did so many things right. If u need to know more about alcoholism, or just plain wanna see Gaga light up the screen, this movie is for you. What's funny is that I knew Dice was gonna be in this film, but totally forgot while watching. He was hardly recognizable as Ally's father, and I loved the relationship between those two. I also liked that Cooper brought in all those stand-up comics into the mix (Chappelle, Dice, Eddie Griffin, Luenell) and even Chappelle's daughter, Sanaa. For a third remake of A Star Is Born, it's definitely a crowd pleaser both musically and emotionally. I was unprepared for how much I enjoyed this rendition
Cefe Hyatt	I absolutely loved this movie..the acting,  the story & the songs!!!! Everyone is wonderful in it from Bradley Cooper to Lady Gaga to Elliot,Dave Chapelle, Andrew Dice Clay & Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real. Can't wait to buy the soundtrack. Go see this movie..it's fantastic & will help a lot of people! Thank you for this movie!

Jay Dauria	This movie actually blew my mind.. It was such a perfect and beautiful story, and really shows how we people are so unique and raw when you really dig deep into your soul to see what makes you, YOU.
Matheus G. S.	This video shows that Bradley Cooper can be a great singer and that Lady Gaga can be a great actress. We should never label people for what they mostly do or appear to be, because the human being is often unpredictable and full of surprises. The movie is wonderful, by the way!
KimandSteph	Such an amazing movie!! Amazing work Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga!! <3 Obsessing over this soundtrack!!
Alexander Veliz	👏👏👏👏👏👏

Ato Kwamina	0:00 - 3:36
khakuda	Was fortunate enough to see them both live after a small industry screening last week.  Terrific film and filmed in 6 weeks which is unreal.  They are both extraordinarily talented.  For Cooper to have written, directed, acted and sang in a film he made happen is unbelievable.  For a first time directorial effort it is unreal how well he did this.  She was always great, but seems to just get better and better in acting, singing, writing, performing.  I would not be surprised to see this get tons of awards.  It deserves them.  The two of them are insanely multi-talented.  Only criticism was that it was a bit long in the second half, but otherwise, this blew me away.  After the screening, the number of fans seeking her autograph outside was unreal.  She has a massive base of fans and I understand why.  Both seem like genuinely really nice people.  Bradley and I graduated from the same college and he spoke to students about the film.  One female undergrad asked him if he could wish Happy Birthday to her mom and he jumped right off the stage without hesitation and sent her a video selfie birthday wish.  Totally cool.

H MAN	Her manager was a prick
Lóis Nascimento	AAAH ❤
Ivan Androsov	Disappointed. Wonderful, sparking and deep dramatic story was chew up by mediocrity of Gaga acting ability in 2018 version . Very fine singer Gaga and very dull actress... probably the Botox in her face did't allowed her to express any emotion, even the carefully positioned "tear" in one eye before the take did not help a bit . 1954 version with Garland is still the best of them all.
Schy Mark	Natural beauty Sexy
Simone	Obsess , i need to go see the movie
Alex Gorell	Who knew Bradley Cooper can sing?  Edit. Lady Gaga needs to use less makeup. She looks amazing. I never actually knew what she looked liked naturally.
2019 Caroline Bracewell	I loved the movie and I love this song!!!!!!!!!!

Grace Wenaas	Does it remind anyone else of bad romance at 2:30ish?
allegory	Wonderful film, just saw it and I'm going back to see it again with another friend next week. Lady Gaga's acting is a revelation. What a great actress she has proven to be! And she and Bradley Cooper light up the screen with love, music and tragedy like no one else.

Labelle Brune	On a du mal à reconnaître la Lady Gaga. 😐 Elle est bien mieux sans tous ses artifices (perruque, maquillage, habits et chaussures à la con...) 😑
paula r	I would watch this if Bradley Cooper wasn't in it. After his performance in that stupid movie " the snipper"  which portrays middle eastern as savages and all his interviews perpetuating that stereotype and brainwash of us American, he simply stopped existing as an actor for me. I don't like ignorant people like him that are uninformed about the world and just spread misinformation.

Freezeky Nugraha	I KNOW IT THAT BRADLEY COOPER CAN SING (HAS GREAT VOICE) LIKE ROBERT DOWNEY JR!!!!!    lady gaga so pretty btw. Damn! So good to see this
Tracy McCloud	Saw film last night. Gaga did a great job...especially for not being an actor "first", so to speak. Comparing it to the 1937, 1954 or 1976 versions is pointless...apples and oranges. Props to Cooper for even aspiring to stack up next to previous versions. My personal favorite is the 1976 Kristofferson/Streisand version, despite loving Judy Garland's performance in the 1954 film. Anyway, this one is worth a peak and Gaga's pipes speak for themselves.
S.L	I thought “Wow! What a beautiful song this is!” before seeing the movie. Now, after seeing it, listening to this actually hurts too f*cking much.

Stephen Do	The first time i saw a trailer on facebook, i was in the shower... facebook auto played the trailer... when lady gaga sang: im off the deep end, watches as i dive in.... i shrink... i said, this is so good... i felt sad at the end Jack commited suicide but so in love with Bradley voice... 18 monthes of vocal training like he said...   This song of Lady Gaga touch the deep end of me... world and life sometime are unfair and not always perfect... the song gives me a door to the place i can escape.. when i feel tired of dealing to things in life  ⭐️in the movie, Alley with red hair (lady gaga loookss so so good and pretty) visit Jack in rehabilitation center, he cried that messed up her image in the Grammy. That scene to me make me feel so so real,  a real soft touch, empahize me. Alley touch his face and forgave him, that is real love . The movie sent a message: Forgiveness is the last stage of love
i love jenna joseph	heeeeey STREAM TRENCH BY TWENTY ONE PILOTS bye
Ella panda	Tell me something, girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there something else you're searching for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing For change And in the bad times, I fear myself  Tell me something, boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing For change And in the bad times, I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  Oh, ohh Oh, ohh Ohhhh  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now
J Lyse	This movie is going to win an Oscar for sure, hands down. Bradly Couper has become a hero to my eyes he is a GENIUS. Lady Gaga is an incredible songwriter and comedian more than an actress i would say. Oh and by the way this is Lady Gaga's second rise up to the stars. Thumb up if y'all agree.
Vivley	LOVE YOU GAGA

Rynosoar	Just got back from this movie and this has had me in shock at how great it truly was! The songs were written with such heart, I felt everything these characters were going through. Their relationship, their ups and downs and most importantly where they were at mentally. Absolutely stunning movie and definitely worth an award, multiple even 😄 Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, hell even the rest of the cast, take a bow 😁
Fayanna Rena	This song sucks
Jessica Moraes	Como disse, ainda bem que a Beyonce engravidou.

serri tenshi	Lady Gaga's best performance and Bradley Cooper's hidden talent is now out in the world. Perfect duet. The movie is worth-watching. I cried many times over but good cry. Lovely, Lovely movie with all the soundtrack💞😊👍
Gabriela Arroyo	God daaaaaaamn is she even real? 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rod	First she showed she could write pop tunes that capture the zeitgeist. Then she proved she could belt out a ballad with a voice that could make mountains tremble. Now we're discovering she's a world class actor who can dig deep and live within moments of raw truth. Let me just say it: Right now, at this moment in time, Stefani Germanotta aka Lady Gaga is the most talented artist on the planet.
Gim Bolwari	She's beautiful and talented I love her the way she is in this movie
candice hsu	I literally cry in this part of movie, I feel like we're all free, Ally and me
Mister Whitty	Always a siren to awake the red vote just in time for November. That's right.
Amy Chavarria	I don’t know about y’all but when Gaga goes ahhhh ahhhh like that the lesbian comes out of me. 😭😭😭💖 We love a queen!
Rut Suryany	Goosebumps all over my body once Lady Gaga sings the high note. Damn. I love her since i’m still in Junior High School until now. 10years passed so fast
Chris Miller	is this song supposed to mean something in that movie??? I like her better when she sings about "Dont be a Drag.. Just be a Queen!" now that is as epic as it gets!! but she has proven she is a great actor - she's always acted like she's got talent and has fooled people for years now!!
Wayne Palmar	honestly...wow!
Ringo Sensei	God this never fails to give me goosebumps. 💕
S. I.	This is so truly beautiful.

Ivan Poldrugač	I get chills every time i heard this song 😍😍😍
Sergei Antonov	Песня сделана на заказ профессионалами. Поэтому её сложно не полюбить. Слов практически нет, но те фразы которые присутствуют, созвучны многим. В сочетании с приятной гармонией, которая, в свою очередь правильно подобрана и созвучна со словами, песня "проглатывается" с удовольствием, вызывая эффект "вдумчивой грусти". Минимализм аранжировки создаёт благоприятный фон, который сам по себе приятен на слух и позволяет сконцентрироваться на голосах солистов. Мужская партия превосходно отражает многолетнюю боль и разочарование с надеждой на кусочек настоящего счастья, которое согреет сердце после долгих скитаний. Женская партия вполне созвучна мужской. Очень грамотно прописана та часть песни, где происходит резкий контраст в динамике, и солистка пронзает воздух своим криком, который пробуждает стремление бороться за то, что каждый из нас заслуживает - любить и быть любимым вдали от боли и страха. С профессиональной точки зрения, создаётся впечатление, что Гага борется сама с собой, пытаясь петь чисто, но временами возвращаясь в своё амплуа и свою авторскую манеру исполнения песен. На мой взгляд, Адель была бы более подходящей в качестве солистки, но по скольку Гага та кто играет в фильме, то и песня исполнена ею же.  Конечный результат: качественный продукт, который сделан правильно и профессионально, и производящий сильное эмоциональное впечатление. Удачно сделанный видеоряд удваевает удовольствие и побуждает посмотреть фильм к которому она написана.
Joshua Smith	Her shock value is to look normal now. Lol
Fede Uy	SLAY ME MOTHER
sonia	She's such a talented beautiful woman. And he's so talented as well. And the fact that he can sing makes him that much hotter
MCU Potterhead	My teacher is obsessed with this movie
abdou azizi	As jasmine masters once said " im giiiigged.  Im giiiiiigged the phuck up"
justinl458	Not to say this film is bad, I loved it but you people that are new to this, it's a 3rd remake. It's not original. I believe it was first made in '54 and '78. Its made directors careers and actors/singers careers. Hopefully Bradley and Lady get slingshotted into the history books. This film better get its nominations and awards. 10/10.

Dale Whitehead	We recently lost a best friend too soon she was 26 less than a week later we went and watched this movie because that's what friends do when they lose one. We come together to get through the pain, we went to the cinemas. I am a massive lady gaga fan and I've been waiting for that moment for 2 years to see her on the big screen. We didn't know what we walked into it was an rollercoaster of a watch, our emotions was up and down we was in adoration of the whole movie. The love between ally and Jackson felt so real and then the ending happened. Our friend did the very same she died in that way we was crying uncontrollably I have never felt that way. It was when gaga sang IWNLA and sang the words goodbye we ran out the cinemas sobbing we never expected that any of that would of happened we did cry for a minute and stood in the hall way to watch the last 3minutes I was shaking with fear for some reason. Gaga you will win a Oscar I have no doubt about that! ❤

Jessie Lindsay	if i could like this a thousand times, i would.
JessTube	PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE (MY OPINION)    Am I the only one that had mixed feelings about the movie? I love Gaga and had REALLY high expectations. In my honest opinion (no disrespect here), the music was really good! The first half of the movie was great and then I felt like it lost its momentum. Bradley was amazing, but I struggled with Gaga's character and her acting. I felt like she was Ally during some moments, and then I saw a bit of Gaga...like the lines were blurred. I wanted Ally to be so different, but then I felt like Gaga wasn't really acting, instead, she was being herself. I wish that Ally didn't color her hair and turn into just another pop star. Also, I don't wanna spoil the ending for those of you who haven't seen the movie, BUT couldn't the ending have been different? I mean this is the fourth remake, and I personally would have liked a different outcome just to change things up. I don't know...I struggled with Jack's "sacrifice" in the end and found it disturbing. He really was pushed over the limits by just talking to Ally's manager? The decision he made in the end was for Ally - to not ruin and hurt her and her career - but that's exactly what he did (he hurt her, not her career). Idk...what did you guys think of the movie?
Fábio Neno	Very addictive song, can't stop paying it ✌🏼😊
Pillow Fighter	i saw the movie ... but i don't get the chorus lyrics: "In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low" why do they repeat this 3x and then say we aren't there...
Mary Rose San Luis	I'm actually gonna see this movie tomorrow with my older brother and his girlfriend. It's gonna be my first time seeing this movie, I love Lady Gaga.

SoCal Drifter	As much as I love comic book movies, scifi and action films I have to admit I'm a sucker for movies that suck me in emotionally. Great movies tend to do that but this one is special. The relationships are raw and real so unlike many movies. The music, characters, story and performances suck you in unlike any movie has for me in like forever. More importantly it touches a nerve because you can relate..... my brother died last year because of addictions he had most of his life and the relationship between Jackson and his older brother hit me like a club. It's amazing what people can do when its propelled by undeniable passion.

talkinjack1	I saw this move today and I cried my eyes out, I thought I was going to have to leave the theatre and regroup. I never followed Lady Gaga's music but omg she is a dynamic vocalist. I have a new found respect for her voice. Shallow is my #1 favorite song. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job as well. If you haven't seen the movie, please go and see it, you won't be disappointed.
NTHN	is Bradley Cooper really singing
Vivi Natalia	Lady Gaga before can be crazy and still beautiful , I adore her too much
Joy Williams	this cinematic excellence set my soul on 🔥...the music is spectacular and the chemistry is undeniable
Nicole Henninger	Gaga went all out for this performance. I was surprised to see that she virtually had no inhibitions in this film. They truly don't make pictures like this anymore.
N G	Best song pick for the Oscars
Tracy Smith	I saw the movie on Saturday, it's Monday and I'm still thinking about it, even dreamt about it.
Future Hunter	Esto es arte! Aunque sea Shakilover (seguidor de Shakira) obvio reconozco que esta hermosa canción es 100000000 veces mejor que Clandestino.
Maga Beasley	OMG! Bradley Cooper sings amazingly! Super sexy and talented, and Lady Gaga is out of this world. Love them both!
wiskers 808	When i saw this yesterday i got goosebumps nonstop
Jenna Brady	I just watched the movie and I’ll never recover💔😭
Karen Lm	I wondered how they created the concert scenes.  Turns out they showed up at real concert venues (I think one was Willie Nelson....could be wrong though), told the crowd what was happening, and went on and played for real live.  This was not CGI, trick camera angles or paid actors.  Probably what made this so authentic.
David Asociado independiente	Muy lindo todo.
pkincy	And she is much better looking as herself than this Alice Cooper like character she prefers to appear as.  And her voice is wonderful particularly if you don't have to watch the costumed character performing.

Mayara Mota	I love to see Gaga this way
madmardagain	She is a true star that for sure she not a bad actor either.. I have only watched the video here but when she first started singing in the video above she looked scared to be up there on stage under the spotlights ..I get the feeling she was a songwriter or something like that in the movie but never performed on stage and she pulled it off beautifully great job acting  and by what everyone is saying about the movie    "SHE IS A TRUE SUPERSTAR THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO FOR THE REST OF US NOBODYS TO ENJOY"      Thanks again  STEFANI
Sarah Lord	Well Bradley sings country that is a little bit disappointing

jose castañeda	Wow gaga se ve tan distinta y hermosa
Lian Bates	This is such a beautiful song and movie
Kasey Mae	God, she’s so absolutely beautiful and no make up or crazy shit is needed to make her the center of attention. I get that was her hook when she first came out but now we get to see the real Lady Gaga and she’s hitting it in the big leagues now. I’d put her up there with some of the best voices I’ve ever heard, but I admit it was hard to ever hear that sometimes through all the insanity though I can’t deny her talent has always been there. I’m just glad to see her embracing just herself and letting that shine through because she’s shining brighter than ever! Always respected her talent but converted full on Gaga fan here ✌🏻
Andrew zonek	I bet it will be the best movie I will see in my life and not to mention its soundtrack <3

Or do you need more Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?  [Refrain: Lady Gaga] I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Ooooo aahaaa ooou (s) Ooo ouo oooo haaaa (s)  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now

libraoxwoman	Wow,!   Tears.....cannot wait to see the movie.
Robert Kresko	Never a Gaga fan. She won me over in this movie. Her voice is unreal. I wish she did more like this. As a man don't you want to hate how diverse and talented Bradley Cooper is (and obviously not serious about that)???  He could be one of the most gifted actors of our time. Research what he did to get ready for this role. If this song (or movie) doesn't evoke emotion for you, feelings probably elude you altogether.
Ivanka2024 for POTUS	they have good chemistry
sylwia_super_star	Can't wait to see this movie again and again and again... love it ❤❤❤
Θανάσης	Finally lady Gaga normal
cramer425	How can anyone dislike this song?  ???????
sandra sandra	Méconnaissable lady gaga
Jawad Ahmed	Lady Gaga is not conservative to issues such as 'makeup'. Rather, she taught the world newer ways to makeup, more like influencing them with her own fashion sense. Can we not define costume as part of 'makeup' too ? If anything that departs from the natural, most of the people defines that as makeup. So then, humankind is naturally naked and therefore a costume is there  to 'make-up'.  Lady Gaga is really pretty with her makeup variations too.
SR 10	I AM BEGGING MY MOM TO WATCH IT SO WE ARE WATCHING IT NEXT WEEK SO IM AM SO FRIGGIN EXCITED

Ruatfela Pachuau	what a voice from two people amazing
Matt Roman	It was definitely a modern-day masterpiece.  It really resonates with people on a gut level, in large part because of the turbulent and uncertain time we live in.  It's nice to lose yourself in a compelling movie with all of the chaos blowing around.
IMetLadyGaga2015 *	Oh Gaga, you never fail to please. Your natural look is just as stunning as your full, blown out, drag queen style!! 👑🥂  Your acting is just as impressive as your singing. I love you so much. 💖Meeting you in 2015 was as much of an honour as it was a pleasure. If you had told me 3 years ago that you would be starring as a lead actress in a Hollywoodd Blockbuster movie... I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED YOU! It's incredible to see that you are showing the world more and more of your blessed talents. ✨

Haris Belkebir	He suicides in the end
Nita Wolvington'miller	This woman has no morals if I remember correctly Barbra Streisand was the first one! And her voice is incomparable! To all you singers or wannabe singers perhaps you should learn a little bit about Opera and there is a lady and her husband who developed the system to teach you so that we can't hear you breathing which you're not supposed to never supposed to hear a person take a breath or anything I believe she was born in 1889 clarabelle's lions very famous one time you know before TV in the radio and there was a technique her and her husband came up with! I should know this because I was her last student so are you kids out there whoever you think you are that you think you're that good why don't you take a little Gander at what she came up with should most fabulous music teacher on the planet! Not to mention the fact that you owe had to have manners and you didn't display yourself disgustingly you don't have to do that to get attention

Ankur Kumar	First time i had listened this song in Trailor , I thought , it is Chris Martin singing in the movie , I am really impressed Bradley Cooper has such good voice. I am already fan of Lady Gaga. She is very beautiful and has beautiful voice.
Brian Twiss	Between seeing this film last night and now, the next morning, I bet I've listened to this song at least four times.  Also, I can’t help but chuckle at 2:50. “I’ll never meet the ground”- cuts to Sam Elliot’s character thoroughly meeting the ground

Lady Gaga is amazing and so beautiful ❤️ the fact that she wanted to act before she started singing and never got a gig acting will show everyone who didn’t want her as their actress to sit the fuck down cause they all missed out on a big star ❤️❤️
Robinl1278	THIS....I saw the movie twice over the weekend and, both times, I literally felt my heart was going to burst during this scene.
MM Castro	Ladygaga has received worldwide attention in a cross-sectional style. And her current beauty is more beautiful.
Maris Weirdo	Yesterday I saw the movie & it was Beautiful & this is my favorite Movie & Song
Lawd Hammercy.	Gorgeous little tune and harmonies and also, somehow, booming vocals. Have to remind myself this isn't a Lady Gaga song and that it's a country Rock duet for movie characters.
Super Strange Planet	Since I was a kid I have loved her...😍

Goof Le Ski	Yesterday I watched the movie. I've never really liked any lady gaga song before, because i've felt no feelings, no emotions.. i don't knew what to do with that.  Yesterday everything changed hahaha  OMG SHE HAS SUCH A POWERFUL VOICE WITH MAAAAANY EMOTIONS! SHE IS SOO F***** BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT MAKE UP AND ALL THIS CRAZY OUTFITS! Sure, if she like to wear such things it's absolutly okay. But I think, she is adorrable just beeing herself! Yeah, now I think I'm a huge fan of the "a star is born"- album 😍 Btw, we should talk about Bradley Cooper... !
jim carpenter	lady gaga is the superstar you expect to never be around or talk to because she seems so unreachable, but then she puts off her make up and you see Stefani Germanotta and she just looks like someone you've been knowing for a long time. maybe your neighbor or the girl at cashier at the next local supermarket or wherever. it´s a beautiful portrayal of how at the end were all the same.
Dini Kombat	Lady gaga looks beautiful with natural makeup

李昕	[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper] Tell me somethin' girl / 女孩 告訴我吧  Are you happy in this modern world? / 在這個世界裡 妳真的快樂嗎? Or do you need more? / 還是妳仍有所嚮往? Is there somethin' else you’re searchin' for? / 妳還在尋找著什麼嗎?  I'm falling / 我深愛妳而無法自拔 In all the good times I find myself longin' for change / 有時我想要嘗試做些改變 And in the bad times I fear myself / 但有時 我心中充滿恐懼  [Verse 2: Lady Gaga] Tell me something boy / 男孩 告訴我吧 Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? / 成天填補內心的缺口 你不累嗎?  Or do you need more? / 還是你仍有所憧憬?

I'm falling / 我深愛你而無法自拔 In all the good times I find myself longin' for change / 有時我想要嘗試做些改變 And in the bad times I fear myself / 但有時 我心中充滿恐懼  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in / 當我縱身一躍 急速墜入水中  I'll never meet the ground / 我便潛入那深不見底的海 Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us / 一旦穿越了水面 便無人能再阻撓 We're far from the shallow now / 我們終於一起沉入了情海  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the shallow / 曾經的我們在淺水徘徊 (x3) We're far from the shallow now / 如今我們終於一起沉入情海  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Woah Woah  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in / 當我縱身一躍 急速墜入水中  I'll never meet the ground / 我便潛入那深不見底的海 Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us / 一旦穿越了水面 便無人能再阻撓 We're far from the shallow now / 我們終於一起沉入了情海  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the shallow / 曾經的我們在淺水徘徊 (x3)  We're far from the shallow now / 如今我們終於一起沉入情海

rcortez2018	By the way, TWO THUMBS WAY UP for the movie...Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga was PERFECT. With that said, is it a coincidence that Lady Gaga's character first name is "Ally"?  My favorite movie of all time is "The Notebook". After watching this Friday night, I am currently reconsidering...

stepholo	I didnt realise what a super talent she was until I watched the doco about her on Netflix
Guilherme Henrique	I love her career as an actress
Sirama	0:54 That man behind Gaga looking at her with so much hope and happiness when she walks out is such a great actor. With that simple eye look and slight movements he completely communicated how each of us feels when we see a person we care for, fulfill theirs happiness. It is those moments where one doesn't feel jealousy for another's happiness but feel sincere joy in someone else's talent that we see humanity at it's purest.   Gaga and Bradley's chemistry through acting and music shows how amazing their friendship will be and I see a lifetime of partnership with them.
Spencer Thompson	This is amazing and so perfect well done lady gaga and Bradley Cooper Oscar all the way
Kai Ming Leung	Goddamn the vocalization starting at https://youtu.be/bo_efYhYU2A?t=147 is the kind of sound that people spend thousands of $$$ on audio equipment to hear.

holly wiley	Lady Gaga u seem different..cleaned up.. did u accept Jesus Christ?? Before u seemed torn and u would throw Illuminati signs.. I’ve prayed for u, u just wanted to do your music and b left alone and not b owned by anyone..U know anyone can do Romans 10:9 and b born again a whole new person..God forgives all sins except one and the one is  blaspheming the Holy Spirit.. Satan is a liar...

[Refrain: Lady Gaga] I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Ooooo aahaaa ooou (s) Ooo ouo oooo haaaa (s)  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We're far from the shallow now

Rock Titan	Definitely a natural beauty.
Bryan Gomez	The picture was gorgeous, the signing was gorgeous, everything was gorgeous.
SuperSausageDog	Lady Gaga is so beautiful with minimal make up and brunette hair. I think it makes you like her more showing her natural side. What a fantastic actress!! And Bradley Cooper is hot hot hot with his long hair and beard. To play a drunk is one of the hardest things as an actor. When they had their first kiss it gave be goosebumps as it felt so real! Can’t stop listening to this song. Just love it when they harmonise together. Amazing xxx
nymet2454	I can't wait to see Bradley sing this song at the 2019 Oscar telecast.

Laura Palmer	Lady is so beautiful here. Love it
Winnie Ting	While watching this video, I could feel the strong emotion from both of them thus make me cry without reason ..
Erin E. Fortin	The movie sucked... Which is to say it stirred every emotion within my bones; I was totally unprepared for the beauty, elegance, love and passion portrayed between Cooper and Gaga - I was pleasantly swept away into their world on the big screen and I am incredibly happy to have had the opportunity to see poetry in motion before my eyes. In short, this is the best movie I have seen this year and I hope the Academy equally shows its appreciation several times over.
Дана Беккулиева	Это супер Классна Заxватывает

Scott Cassin	I’m a 50ish guy who had never knowingly heard a note of LG’s music before seeing this film... her music wasn’t even on my radar. I’ve gotta say, after seeing the film I’d place her in very high company in terms of overall star power. I don’t mean the worlds absolute best singer or actor but rather the special radiance that glows around a very few performers such as Springsteen, Madonna, Bono, Michael Jackson et al. I feel this lady brings that same level of energy to her art... it’s simply a higher level, a different energy, that these types of elite performers radiate.
Case Redmond	Anyone else wish that song kept going?
saltywalt x	If i see the trailer for this movie in theaters again,Im gonna loose it

Jules Grooten	the movie was a 10/10 their acting and singing was out of the roof!!! The ending was really sad and depressing tbh, without spoiling much it just goes to show how this society and industry is capable of ruining everything in life.

Alexandros Siamopoulos	Lyrics at 1:45 and their rhythm remind me Shinedown's Diamond Eyes, at the point where they sing: "I'm on the frontline, don't worry i'll be fine, the story is just beginning..." It is just a note and it is something it came to me just as i saw it, i am not shitting on the song or anything.  Song is nice, gaga's voice is top notch and movie seems to be extremely good!

othrockzmysockz	This film absolutely destroyed me - and I cannot handle how talented these two are. I mean we knew Bradley Cooper was an incredible actor....then he starts singing and it's like wtf how can this be possible. Then Lady Gaga omfg, everyone is well aware of her superhuman singing abilities but her acting in this movie was sensational.....all the awards please!!!
LoneWolfMonster	Watch it in theatres, Gaga's singing and vocals will definitely give you the chills!! Had lots of goose bumps while watching the movie! A Must-Watch!!❤
achilles	The Queen of POP is back to slay!!!👑👑👑
DJ	beautiful like tum hi ho
ASOSOSOA x	I watched this movie yesterday. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The  music touched my heart. Also the way it's filmed is amazing. The whole story is so beautiful and at the same time heartbreaking. My father drinks alcohol everyday too and I wish he'd choose to do therapy by himself but he doesn't want to. He says he's okay but he knows he isn't.  Lady Gaga has been a great influence to me and I really loved her acting also the fact that all of the performances were live blow my mind. She's truly a great musician and an even bigger inspiration.
RF 666	im in love with this
LIZZYRULES	I can't imagine how crazy and hard Gaga's life has to be, and then she just keeps killing it and gives us fans something untouchably gold like this. I'm so obsessed with this movie. It's perfect. Thank you Bradley, thank you Lady

cag cag	Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Lady Gaga:] Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga:] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

Julie Schafer	The music from this movie was surprising very good.  I did not think this movie could ever even half way do justice to the one in 1976 but it was very good.  Loved the music!  Hope it does as well with the Academy Awards as the one from 1976.  It is close to being as good but I will still take the earlier version.  It seemed more passionate.

Mary Keating	I will NOT watch this movie in a theater because I know that I will cry my eyes out. On another note, the chemistry between BC and SG (via the trailer) is palpable and moves my soul. I need to watch this movie at home where I can get red eyes and a runny nose in private. And by the way, SC is absolutely stunning without the warpaint.

R Kraus	In a way this has given her the country, singer songwriter identity she craved in Joanne but didn’t quite meet the mark due to her theatrical performer background and sound.

M. Booth	Bradley died.
Lorin Drake	Incredible haunting and beautiful song. Full body goosebumps! 😍👏
Kjasmin Morales	I had so many chills when she sang 😭
Angie Moreno	It’s just me or Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper would be a great couple in real life ? ❤️
Wallace Wells	Though the film blew my mind, there are so many missed storylines on Ally's part of the journey. 1. She completely lost track of herself. The cheap pop songs, the argument with her manager, her new look... 2. Her father heartbreakingly searched for excuses that his daughter wasn't famous and he's only proud of her because of her new fame. All of that would have deserved a deeper storytelling in the  film which takes a very long time to build one story.
Sammie Westover	This song gives me chills. I love both of their voices. And with these clips with it. Wow.
Kevin McLaren	can't wait... a classic of a legend movie (1976) reprised for the modern era. Never a fan of Lay Gaga... but from what clips I've seen. Just wow.

Mains Blanches	Kind of feels like a mega episode of "The Voice" or "America's got Talent"!!...of course, she's a very good singer (we all know that already), and a good actrice (now we know), but it just seems like it's just to easy to set her up in such a context!!...playing a poor girl from the ghettos would be a more convincing role for her to play!!...

Sally Voodvil	😭😭😭
Jacob Taylor	Lady Gaga - “I want to do a movie about MY life and what I had to go through to get ME into fame, and I want Bradley cooper to upscale the quality of men I can actually pull” ... she isn’t a war hero, or any kind of hero who broke people free from the iron grip of governmental control. Just another tool reciting the propaganda they tell her to repeat. This doesn’t deserve to be a movie.

Renáta Pluhařová	I saw it yesterday and I was crying and claping with my hands in the end. I can say that this movie is the best music drama I've ever seen.
Œil de Givre	I think that after this movie, Lady Gaga has nothing to prove when it comes to her vocal performances. I went to see A Star Is Born last night and was dazzled to the end. Nobody can pretend that she doesn't have the voice of a real godess.
Lhiz dela Paz	She's more pretty without make up 😘😘😘

Dj Branch	It's amazing how you can hear the nervousness in her characters voice when she starts singing, but then by the time it kicks in again, that nervousness is gone and its just her brilliant voice.
Carlota FP	Omg.... First La la land.... Then this... My head is blowing up. Gaga, wanna see you in the Oscar's and in the Granny's..... You and Bradley are so freaking talented..... Your voices are amazing.... It's been a long time since I heard this type of music in movies or musicals...That film is going be historie😭❤️

Blastoff2moon	Generic and bland , Gaga makes better music than this .I thought this movie would give country music some attention . But it's just like all other epidemic of Hollywood remakes .

Kim Boer	this movie broke my heart
Lizzy Hsieh	I think I finally get to really understand this great star for the first time. She feels so real, like an ordinary person, yet so beautiful at the same time, and I couldn't stop my tears...
Mario Martinčević	Such amazing song!
the big skub	Y'all do realize that when an actor looks natural in a movie, there's still makeup involved right? Like y'all really think makeup comes in a certain look and form? Lol
B Elise	Why is everyone so obsessed with this movie? I was seeing a different movie in the theatre and I kid you not FOUR DIFFERENT trailers for this film were shown!! It just solidified the fact that I do not want to see this movie lol. Annoying scream-singing and nothing else does NOT make for a good trailer sorry. Bye
GVSolo	This scene of the movie was magical. It totally blew me away.
Michael SS	This is the most beautiful song i swear ❤️
Cristian Cavazzoni	A typical Italian woman whitout make up......intense , real , where all our flaws and quality are visible. She's great.
Илья Жеребцов	never thought i'll see Gaga without makeup i'm not surprised. she's very beautiful woman
Red Salmon	Watched it today! Ladies to my left and right were constantly wiping their eyes while sniffling.  Awesome movie from start to finish.  There isn’t a family out there that struggles with alcoholism. I’m sure it will move anyone who sees this film.
Phillip Brewster	I don't care how much I got paid as an actor I could not make out with a trans... I'll be skipping this movie
This Is Fifty With Lil	Superb, magical.

RAch711baby	I just saw this tonight I’m so speechless both performances are amazing
logan thompson	I'm weak. 😩
Laila Kabongi	Who's cutting onions
Mark Stimson	I have never liked Lady Gaga.  Most of her music and videos are so vulgar and repulsive that I refuse to be soiled by their content even though Million Reasons is one of my all time favorites.  In this movie and this role that I sense reflects some of her true story,  I can see coming from her real human emotion and experience.  She is unbelievably talented and beautiful.  If this is the real Lady Gaga, then I am a fan.  I hope her future music is down to earth like what is portrayed here.
Dulce Esperanza Roa	♥ #repeat one
Imbra Kim	I don't like the trailer but the comments have intrigued me. If it's a heartfelt realistic story about the hardships of loving an alcoholic, I'll go see it.
yellow potato	I saw the movie yesterday,  it was the premiere here on my country.  I loved it.
Afsheen Rashid	That ha uh ah oh part where Lady Gaga does that power belt at like 2:27 ish sounds so familiar, I just can't put my finger on where I've heard it. It's stunning.

ab bc	Isnt this ‘aashique 2 ‘ an indian movie .. hollywood copying bollywood ... hmmm

Gemini Damien	This is too beautiful.
Ronald Garcia	I feel like we're gonna see Gaga a lot during awards season. Great movie! Probably a mix of a shit ton of emotions throughout the whole movie! Definitely worth sitting down for 2 hrs.
jolene larrabee	I love their chemistry together 💗
Lynda Clark	Wow Amazing... Can't wait to see the movie.
kenchun24	Meh...it was alright. Panos Cosmatos' "Mandy" still my fave movie of 2018. This is an archetypal story in it's 4th remake, a drunk and a dreamer meet cute then go through the highs & lows of balancing relationship/substance abuse/stardom. Gaga was fine playing herself basically, Cooper was good, songs were great, hope to see Cooper direct more, that was the true star of this movie, his direction.
Abby Hunt	Just watched it. Omg, what a roller coaster. I can’t stop thinking about it! Expect Oscar noms for Cooper and Gaga
DudeManWow	is anyone gonna mention the obvious chemistry. looks convincing.
Skinny Legend	MOM
The Protagonist	I'm in love with this song.

Gutalac Ni Bai	Goddess ❤️
squishy min.yoongi	Oof
louloutre	I see some people talking about Oscars... are you serious? I understand you are Gaga fans and that you are all excited because it's her first movie, but this is a just another teen movie : "- oh I like to sing - so you should follow your dreams - no I can't, I'm not good enough - yes you are and you gonna be a big star because I love you "  It's the kind of cheesy story we have seen millions of times, including in "Burlesque". Come on, get real. It's a cute movie, that's it.
Audrey Norman	I have fallen into the deep end!
Split Banana	It's been a long time since I just curled up listening to a song and felt it. I'll eat my socks if this song doesn't get the Oscar.

Love from Romania 💗
Meha Anam	I’m listening again and again ☺️
The_Smallville_Mailbox	Lady Gaga looks stunning without makeup!!! Bradley actually got a Make up wipe and cleaned it off her face

Lovely Flower	I love the music
Robbie Brown	Gaga is on her way to win an Oscar! 🏆

Bluzeeedsel pinto	WHAT DOES BEING 6'4 AND 225 HAVE TO DO WITH CRYING?    ------>> Because someone has longer bones and more girth they are emotionally stronger? That's bullshit. Some of the toughest humans i've ever met are small and scrawny. Reeeediculous!

Piet K	Just here because of football commercials
Independent Truth Seeker	Great song and hope the movie matches !!
Scott Wallace	I wanted to comment on the powerful performance of the two leads and the powerful message of the song. Then I made the mistake of reading the responses to some of the comments. And my faith in humanity, already pretty low, dipped even lower. The need to attack others. I don’t get it. I’m glad I don’t get it. Those who do so to elevate their opinion of themselves are what’s wrong with our culture. When you feel the urge to make fun of someone or call them a name, imagine that you just met them at a dinner party and they’re just a smiling human being in front of you, hoping to exchange a kind greeting. If, after doing this visualization exercise you still want to make fun of them? That’s sociopathic behavior. Fight against your sociopathic tendencies.
Matthew Watkins	Beautiful movie.
Dylan Stanley	I hate watching love stories like this because then I wish they were a couple in real life

gabriel rivera	Her voice by itself can touch your soul without instruments.
Eric Gori	The oscars are a fucking joke. All these rich liberal hollywood actors and actresses living in their FANTASYLAND. Who cares if they win an oscar😕
Jade Pender	I’m so excited for this movie I feel like the dude in the background behind Lady Gaga who’s like yaas girl get on that stage! The industry has done this to me. Where I was good but they didn’t like my look. So I hid my talent. Never again. Find another way. Sometimes the world just need authentic raw pure talent & @ladygaga did that! Such a strong beautiful voice. Bradley Cooper thank you!! Let’s go get this Oscar! We need more inspiring life changing movies like this! Don’t let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game 😍🙌 #astarisborn #ladygaga #bradleycooper  #genius  #oscars

VISION0STUDIO	not use to see  Stefani with black hair, this movie should be a solid one with awards winning Cooper directing it, awesome
Jack Cox	I saw the film last night. I had low expectations going in. I knew Lady Gaga was a supreme talent. I was blown away by how amazing Bradley Cooper's direction was and how great a singer he was. This song is an instant classic and will be one that I can expect to hear in many a karaoke bar. That's not a negative by the way. It's a huge positive. This is such a good song and it's been a while since I've heard one like this.
mio akiyama	My friend and I were both quiet at last part of the movie, and I'm trying so hard not to cry. Then I said, "let's go" and she started sobbing. We had to sit there for couple of minutes till she's calmed down.
Prof Xavier	So beautiful!

Hopefully after the FOURTH time I ll be able to let this movie go for a wh.... week. BRAVO.  P.S: Give that woman the Oscars.

Michael Hastie	She really has a great voice.  This is the first time I have listen to her sing.  Every time I've seen her on TV, or in the papers she is always dressed in stupid looking attire so I thought she was just another music gimmick, boy was I SO WRONG!  Looking at these videos on the movie "A Star is Born" has made me a fan of her singing voice.  The other movie "A Star is Born" with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is the ONLY movie I have ever gone to see in the cinema two days in row.  That movie made me feel so good, and at the time I wished I could have fallen in love with someone like Barbara Streisand's character.  I no longer go to cinemas anymore, with all these idiots using their mobile phones.  I will just have to wait until this version with Lady Gaga comes out on DVD.  Because of thes idiots with mobiles phones, I haven't been to the cinema in four years, and never will again.

Alla Asatryan	[Bradley Cooper] Tell me something girl… Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there something else you’re searching for?  [Verse 2: Bradley Cooper] I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Verse 3: Lady Gaga] Tell me something boy… Aren’t you tired trying fill that void Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore  [Verse 4: Lady Gaga] I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now [Post –Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now   In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now
Makale Fitzgerald	Such a beautiful movie. I have always been a fan of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, but my appreciation for their work is through the roof. This was the best movie I have seen all year. So many emotions, it really hit the spot.
LISA STAR	YES!
Sophia Thai	AHHHH I SERIOUSLY GET GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME I HEAR 2:34
Asmokys	Fucking good movie, i cried 3 times because of the songs, 1 because of the end.
porkchoppeaches	Its amazing how the industry can go gaga over a movie essentially highlighting the dreams of America's lower middle class, while doing everything in their power to Destroy that group of people.
Aafreen Zeenat	I never thought that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga these two names together can ever be used in one sentence. And I am surprised that these two are the most refreshing thing I have seen lately as far as movies are concerned.   How is it possible that her beauty can be so refreshing ... Why use so much makeup when you have such a beautiful face and rightful heart. She is mesmerizing.
perth45	great track...
Hannah Beck	Love it😍
Athi Athi	I love you lady gaga
Dan	DISLIKE! This is nothing like Venom! Some rather reputable reviews recommended taking my family out of the screening for Venom and watching this  instead, so against their wishes, that is what I did, although my family appeared to not enjoy this as much as the latest Marvel blockbuster, they are now all keen to watch American Sniper for the first time, especially little Jocko (He's 7yrs old but can draw a gun as fast as any cowboy).
Victoria J	This song goes for an Oscar!!!

Ryan Zimbabwe	my heart goes shalalalala shalalla in the morning
Darin I	Saw the movie last night.  Amazing!  At the end of the movie, as the credits starting to roll, the audience sat in almost complete silence.  The only sound I could hear was from people sniffling, blowing their noses, and wiping their eyes.  Always a good sign of a great movie!

andre ka	lady gaga aparte se estar llena de operaciones esteticas  esta loca y es fea
TrySanity	This movie ripped my soul in pieces. Loving an alcoholic is one of the hardest things a person can go through. Especially when that person is a young woman with little self-esteem. We (a group of us who all loved alcoholics at one point), stayed in the theatre 15 minutes after it ended, in uncontrollable tears. No one could have written the story of my emotional life better than this. I was able to release some trapped PTSD emotions. However, reliving it last night was close to a 2 hour nightmare. I hope you win every possible award for your performances and writing. I hope this movie awakens people to the importance of believing in yourself and staying healthy without habits turning into far worse than Friday night fun. ❤️
weza carvalho	Lady Gaga is soo beautiful ❤️🙌🏾
Faris Azhar	Rocket Raccoon has good voice tho
Mark Conway	This... song.
Twice Queen	So pretty
David Rosa	Yesterday I had the fortune of being able to see it in preview and I must say that, without being especially fan of Lady Gaga, it makes a tremendous role is a wonderful movie, which critics will attack without a doubt but that has a message that arrives and that makes that after watching it, this song will keep remembering you. Congratulations
Ms Synchronicity	This is the Lady gaga i'd love to see more of.......Superb vocals, and wow what a tune, absolutely beautiful
Greti	I dont know why but it makes me cry. Sublime.
DoubleDeckerAnton	It's a great song...!!! A future classic...!!! Go on Gaga...!!! 🎙🎶🗣🎸🥁🙋‍♀️😀👍
yoni baroni	After a hundred incarnations of reinvention. After years Lady Gaga has become irrelevant and is no longer interesting. Lady Gaga proves that she is capable of reinventing herself. I think it's really Lady Gaga's year now. After more than a decade of the big break again Lady Gaga became the big star. This time in a different and higher quality and more appreciated.
jessica fagundes	Eu amoooooo isso!!
The Matt McGee Agency	Love that a ton of comedians are in this movie. Eddie Griffin, Dave Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay, loved it

Tiago semedo	2:50 OMG , so cute 💚😳😘
martin koloc	Very very very BEAUTIFUL 😁👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
TAwna Morris	The way he looks at her when she's singing and scared to death. That smile on his face that says " Look what this amazing woman can do, LOOK!" it so full of pride for her.  GAH! That's  the way my husband (who has Asperger's ) looks at me when I'm presenting my business /Product.
sindexter	Gaga should stick to her crappy circus act and stay away from movies
asay	oh, come on. how chliche. lets get away with our motorbike, singing pseudo country songs on the guitar, break free, find big love and then we cry and after that come back together!!!! this is so boring omg. hope for you the movie is better and what about the botox in lady gagas lips? fuck! thats ugly

Ryan Hargreaves	What is disgusting is how long we’ve had to wait for this. I’ve been searching for this for a month and it’s only just been released to the uk + why? Youtube your scum. + any conservatives who disagree, you + your children will be sterilised in the new wave of humanity
max2082	This was a wonderful movie. Solid cast most of time it was like being at a concert. A pretty good story of the struggles of fame and addiction. If you love Lady Gaga this will be an absolute treat for you.
Soie LuvsMonstaX&B.A.P&2NE1	such a masterpiece, Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper did that so overwhelmed by the movie, A Star is Born is is so good
Jaimee Josephs	Wow...just wow! My new favourite song.

Sébastien V D MR	J adore 🤘😍👍
Cristian Barillas	Holy shit.
Ela Dawn	Love these songs! covered "Is that alright" my absolute favorite!
Jamie Horselman	I DONT GET THE DIS LIKES .... WANKERS
Mark Armage	It's clear,  teaching Bradley Cooper how to sing worth way much more than teaching Lady Gaga how to act. The movie was acceptable,  it can't be good due to lack of attention to the editing,  a poor job rewriting lines,  and sloppy directing from Cooper at the ending. Basically giving Gaga a solo performance that isn't much more than a concert final number.
Brianna Camacho Pietri	It hurts
chandler tribbiani	is rocket actually singing this song?
Juliana Souza	😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
JP Baiao	There's something strange with the transition from min 2.27 to 2.28 , seems the sound was cut to something tot. different

maria1975203	Amo esa mujer...
Express Mart	Flop
Daniel Santana	Just watched the movie, it was amazing. This will definitely be nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars 2019 and can't wait for their performance at the show, also Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper deserves to be nominated, Bradley for both acting and directing. And Best Movie of course.

The MustangFan13	And who said Lady Gaga can't act?
grafton07	I'm so grateful for Lady Gaga showing and being granted the opportunity  to show her amazing talents. She's su h an inspiration for me as a woman, a fibromyalgia warrior, a woman, and to Bradley for his amazing talent, lived him since "Silver Linings Playbook " and so many amazing performances including this one, as a fellow Hoya! ( Georgetown University alum). Thank you both, you keep me and many going!,

MO HA	愛にあふれていて、涙でてきました。素敵です。
Martino Ausencio	Preciosísima canción
Tim Ashley	Full disclosure: I've never been a big Lady Gaga fan. At all. I'm not exactly her target demographic. And music aside, I still disagree with much of her underlying espoused philosophy.  That all said, I was impressed and even moved by this performance. When stripped of all the studio post-processing of much of her existing body of work, she actually has a pretty amazing voice. It was a delight to hear her "open up" in this full-throated vocal demonstration. I'm hoping she takes this cue and releases more in this style.
Shane Carter	They will win a lot of Oscars! And they better play this song at the show!
Jenny	Hallelujah, finally the whole song!!
Johanna Andrade	Ecuador loves you ❣ ❤ ❤

Kpop Fans	Gaga
Just Tester_99	I predicted all this and more in less than a week after discovering this lady Gaga persona here on YouTube even though she had been out for almost a year (late to the party). She's still raw - due to the fact that she left school early and didn't get a more formal college education in the Arts - but still a few steps above most if not all of her contemporaries. Best continued wishes.
NøGrip	Gaga looks so beautiful without all the stuff she use to wear o.o...
Heather S	You are so beautiful like this, Lady. I love your voice and talent. You are a star that has done what most others havent. Studied and experience just about every style of music to become a versatile and creative artist and well rounded person. I admire that from one musician to another. Cant wait to see this movie. Thanks for sharing your talent with the world and for honing in, learning and constantly developing your talent.
john tipton	Why was Bradley hiding this voice, he’s amazing! They both are!

I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself   Tell me something, boy Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void?  Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself   I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now ❤️🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶

blume Ufb	best version of mrs. gaga i‘ve ever heard! 😊👌🏼 i like the ‚new‘ you!
Strode #4278	Good thing GaGa has a bunch of fans who would buy her spit off the floor. She's one of the most overrated acts these days imo. Watching her trying to look shy and nervous is nowhere near believable but she will probably win an Oscar because overrated is the thing in Hollywood these days and it'll be kinda fun to see Streisand trying to look happy for her.
Maria Alex Blanka	Great
Emilio Suarez	Vengo por parte de LA DIVAZA

I’m not even a fan, I never was interested but after seeing her looking natural and beautiful and real here it gave me a whole different perspective. Her crazy getups is what always kept me away. I might actually want to watch this movie.

delfin7461	I am so happy she's done something like this.. people will really see her talent. She's a great musician and songwriter and a pretty decent actress.

Can't wait to see this film.

xvictorialx	Not gonna lie it's weird seeing Bradley Cooper in a movie without Jennifer Lawrence  EDIT: I'm honestly not sure why people are getting upset with this comment...I like lady gaga and the movie looks like its going to be really good regardless of if Jennifer is in it or not I'm aware Jennifer can't sing like lady gaga and that gaga was probably a better casting choice for this movie. All I said is that it's going to be weird because since 2012 Jennifer and Bradley have been making amazing movies together. I'm sure this movie will also win an oscar. Can people stop getting worked up over my comment now 👌

Hunter Huntington	That Racoon can sing.
DYAUS	The song is okay, nothing AMAZING, like most people on here are saying. I was actually expecting something more from these two. It's not bad, just not great. Just okay. Much better written songs from bands a lot of people don't know of, or listen to. Like Kaleo, etc.

Twiggy the lizard	Man, this touched how fucked up relationships and life are. I mean, were all good people, but the emotions and life issues and mistakes we make suck. When he punched the guy, I suppose the old guy fucked Lady Gaga because he forced her to somehow. Or she felt she had to do it.

J'ai beaucoup aimé le choix et le jeu des acteurs, d'une grande sobriété, la qualité des dialogues, la beauté de cette histoire d'amour, l'hymne à l'authenticité. Que d'émotions nous donnent Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga et tous les autres acteurs ! A voir en version originale, évidemment. Les voix chantées s'accordent parfaitement. Merci et félicitations à toute l'équipe du film.

Max Reed	Achieving multiple eargasms from 2:28
Old Person	Took all that makeup and production to create Gaga now she can walk out and slay in minimal makeup and just that incredible deep tonal voice. Had she started this way, she would have faded into the wallpaper. In context this is just brilliant. She willed herself to Superstardom. Cudos to Gaga. It's like Madonna with talent. And boy can that sexy young man sing...who knew?
LudZie EE	i think this song is n4 on trending in my country just cuse i watched it a milion times
Whatever Dude	I'm not crying,it's just the dust of nostalgia entered my eyes
Louis Lopes	Rocket? you can sing.. You can sing with Peter btw
JMike S	My head, chest or both is going to explode now...this video + Having so many favorite any thing's together at once, then to be so perfect together is almost too much. Powerful enough the guitar piece took me only about 30 minutes (I'm not stingy if anyone wants it).  I already loved these two enough (ok, too much) before this movie existed. I'm obsessed with Gaga as a musician, but she's a freaking adorable human being. Pile on top how great Bradley Cooper is in the same ways Gaga is, cares so much about doing things right. So, music, guitar playing, Gaga's beautiful face and voice, guitar playing, concert stuff, Bradley's beautiful face and voice...oops, what?..uhhh, yeah, country music, and the man Chris Kyle. God Bless Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for who they are, and for putting their hearts into everything they do, and all of you.
South Georgia's Drummer and Grill Master	Meh !
Hope Emph	a wonderful song by Lady Gaga!

Together Mutiny	There are real musicians all over this world. Most of them don't have the advertising budget to stand out in the crowd! The longer they hold on to their dreams the closer their lives begin to resemble a nightmare! This is what happens when years of hard work don't pay off! I am happy someone gets to live the dream! Beautiful song (kudos to it's composer).

̇ HKarcsi	I think his an actor. BUT NO.!!!
imogenium	we needed something this pure <3
Alexandre P-N	This song and the last song from the movie I already saw in premiere made me cry for 3 reasons. Lady Gaga is beautiful and was known as someone hiding herself on the scene, and B. Cooper gave people hope there is talent in anyone, him especially after this movie, which will, let’s be honest, win him & her some Oscars. Last reason but not least, the movie in the end made everyone cry in the cinema and I’m not a sensitive person. Well done to both of you.
Guadalupe Barraza	Es la primera vez que encuentro atractivo a Bradley. Gaga más que una persona, ella es la escencia de la música.

BlueSide 1802	I've been waiting for this for so long. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
David Wilson	I don't care what people say whether they like Bradley Cooper's voice or not but I'm telling you from what I'm hearing Brad has some fantastic pipes on him. There are people who can do years of voice training and still not sound anywhere near as good as Bradley and so I am left under the impression that if Bradley chose to audition for America's Got Talent he would go a long way he may not win but he would give it a good shot.
moonchild	OMG YES LITTLE MONSTERS STREAM THIS SONG. LETS BRING BACK LITTLE MONSTERS REIGN LIKE WE USED TO.

Sonali Salaria	I just hope it doesn’t have the story of Indian movie Aashiqui2. A famous singer making a star out of a girl singing in bar . Fighting his alcohol addiction. Falling in love with her . Becoming jealous and violent when she becomes a bigger star then he ever was. Emotionally breaking down. And then suicide. Leaving her alone forever.... but yeah why not coz Aashiqui 2 was also a ‘a star is born’ remake.
Leandro de andrade	Caralho ... Que letra linda ... Ansioso pelo filme . Dupla sensacional.

Alexandra Rain	I don’t think I’ve ever felt such emotion from a song before, until this one. The moment she hit her higher notes, I cried with her. Lady Gaga puts her heart and soul into her music and it shows so clearly. This song is beautiful, the best one I’ve heard this year. They sounds amazing together.
X Ray	Lady Gaga acting so natural. See the end of video. Incredible
張J	OMG love this song Soooooo much!  Can't wait for the movie! My friends keep telling me to listen to this song and good thing I listened to them. It's blowing my mind! 😍😍😍😍  So glad that Lady Gaga took the role, she seems perfect for it! (and we get to hear her amazing vocals) if she ever comes to Asia for another concert I'm definitely going to go! My friends are so happy that she got better 😇😇 we all feel so happy for her.  Love from Asia ~

Justin Donahue	Wow! This is a beautiful duet. The song builds slowly with Bradley kicking off. I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely his voice sounds, and Gaga continues to build harmonic tension as she continues with the second verse. Entering the chorus, Gaga’s first high Alto belt gives me goosebumps and brings tears to my eyes. Excellent song! I can’t wait to see the movie and to buy the album.

Hotdog Channel	Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper - Shallow (A Star Is Born) (Official Lyrics)  (Bradley Cooper) Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  (Lady Gaga) Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  (Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper) In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  (Lady Gaga) Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  (Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper) In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now

sravan kumar	I fuckin don't understand why people are just dieing to watch love things all the time??!!!!    They always make us think like love is the only thing in the world...It's good if they talk about father and mother love.  We get life only once we can see plenty of other things in the world not only a girl or boy.  Whenever I try to hear an American song it always about love shit.

Thumbs up if you think that there is no female artist more versatile than Lady Gaga...
So Ni	Her first time acting and his first time singing...this is so special. I look forward to melting into the experience of this film. The depth and chemistry is unreal...or made it IS real. I ship it. 🙂

Fisioterapia Peculiar com Luciano Silva	Aquele momento que a letra da música vira um espelho, vc se reflete nele e vê vc por inteiro, tudo a ver com vc, aí vc sai correndo tentando se esconder do seu reflexo mas a melodia, o dedilhado do violão faz tudo ficar calmo e aí vc para pra ouvir pq já se sente seguro, e no fim percebe que está tudo bem e vc só quer ouvir, ouvir e ouvir repetidas vezes, pq vc está se sentindo real.  Ameiiiiii😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Steph.fontanez	Gives me chills💗🎵
Killerqueen666	It's stunning.  Great performances by both!  I totally expected it from Gaga, but Bradley Cooper could've had himself a country music career if he wanted.  He sings better than a lot of "top 40 artists".  I'm a little bummed because I know this movie is going to be nominated for Oscars, and it will probably be up against Bohemian Rhapsody!!

A Mary	From google: The definition of shallow is something that is not deep or someone who is concerned only about silly or inconsequential things. An example of shallow is a hole that is only an inch deep. An example of shallow is a person who only cares about someone's looks and how much money they have.

Авторская песня	1https://www.chitalnya.ru/work/1485506/ Я бы спел для вас хит, Только вот не могу - Тонзиллит и бронхит, Колет в бок и стреляет в ногу. 2 Я бы Леди Гагу изобразил – Перепел-переплюнул… Если б я цаплей был, Я бы песней вас цапнул и клюнул. 3 Заклевал бы ваш мозг, Может быть, и до сердца дошёл… Если б я был, как Босх, Рисовал бы хиты, не бежал за грошом. 4 Что мой хит – вам его не понять. Не разглажен, не причесан, не выбрит. Слишком круглый, чтоб его можно было обнять, Слишком крупный, чтоб вписать его  в габарит. 5 Я бы спел для вас хит, Только вот не могу - Тонзиллит и бронхит, Колет в бок и стреляет в ногу. 6 Я бы Леди Гагу изобразил – Перепел-переплюнул… Если б я цаплей был, Я бы песней вас цапнул и клюнул.

Chris G	Yet another single/project of LG’s that is massively overhyped yet fails to deliver and is mediocre, at best, like MOST of her work post-Redone. This whole campaign and Gaga narrative that is forced upon the GP, is premeditated and very calculating by she and her team and her friend Rupert Murdoch who owns most of the press. She NEVER receives bad publicity. Even when she works with sexual predators, glorifys drug use and eating disorders, is literally puked on by another female and called “art”, flashes her vagina, and has been caught in REPEATED lies over the years and yet she rarely EVER receives bad press. She is extremely protected by the powers that be in the industry.

XFendi Prada	I knew this was going to suck before I clicked it and I was right up until halfway through the song Lady Gaga lets out a belch of vocal chords like no other. Lady Gaga is talented and I respect her for not including a mumble rapper in her songs. I love the guitar and drums mixed with the powerful range of her voice! Reminds me of Halestorm
So Young Moon	Oh my gosh, the feels from this are insane. i literally teared up watching/listening to this......you can literally see her transitions on stage from fear, uneasey, slowly more assure, and then finally letting it all bare when she hits those gorgeous eye notes!! And you can see him egging her on, supporting her so much without saying a word, and then joining her to end the song BEAUTIFULLY!! And then watching their various emotional love scenes, up and downs, man....... It has been a very very long time since I've wanted to see a movie this badly..... Also, I really want them to record an album together!! haha They sound so wonderful together 😍😍😍

Andie MacDonald	Bradley Cooper] Tell me something, girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there something else you’re searching for? I’m falling In all the good times, I find myself longing For change And in the bad times, I fear myself  [Lady Gaga] Tell me something, boy Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore? I’m falling In all the good times, I find myself longing For change  And in the bad times, I fear myself I’m off the deep end Watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  [Both] In the sha-ha-sha-hallow In sha-la-sha-la-shallow In the sha-ha-sha-hallow We’re far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga] Oh, ha-ah-ah-ah Haaa-ah-ah-ah, haaawaah, ha-ah-ah-aaahI’m off the deep end Watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface Where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  [Both] In the sha-ha-sha-hallow In sha-la-sha-la-shallow In the sha-ha-sha-hallow We’re far from the shallow now

Archanfel80	I barely recognised Brad.
Tess Williams	I wasn't a huge fan of Lady Gaga . I always thought her music was good but it got over shadow with all the crazy, goofy , off the wall outfits and shoes she would wear . Everybody was to worried about what she did or didn't have on . But this movie I feel is going to show us the real Lady Gaga . She's not all glammed up like the Hollywood puppet she used to be. She is just a plain everyday looking girl in this movie and she looks beautiful her voice sounds great and this movie is going to be Oscar nominated for sure. I'm glad Lady Gaga is back and she's giving us some real music💯🎶🎶🎤🎤😀😀😎😎

Jhe Soette	❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Irkajavasdream	Just $%^$, no words this song is so good. I listened it to it twice in a row with my headphones and I am in tears just because of how beautiful they both sound, and especially together at 2:09!!! His voice is gorgeous. They have such an intense connection and they filmed and MADE a romantic film, so their lovers irl must have really had to push themselves at times to keep trusting their person didn't fall for their character's lover in this whirlwind on-screen romance. I've seen every interview so I know they get along so well and they are both so hot! Christian sat right behind Gaga at Celine in Paris, after taking her to her seat in front, next to what ended up being Karl Lagerfeld and Stephen Gan once the dust settled. I think it's so hot that he has no problem giving Gaga anything she needs and taking a back seat... until later that night...!! Yes! I am so into them as a couple.  I don't know what Bradley's woman looks like but that may be for the best this movie and Gaga and her men have me turned up enough! I need to find a boyfriend and fast. OH so I later looked up his girlfriend and soon realized why she is secure enough in her own beauty. Damn she is a tall exotic gorgeous sultry sexy model from Russia!! She does other things too I think I read acting and writing but I didn't look too long. I have now heard this song 5 times and def initely the best part is them together at 2:09 that part shala la la lal os. His voice is so insane.

Alison MacDonald	Get the fucking fuck out. I have been living in a cave and I must see this movie. Gaga always amazed me with her "In yo face" schtick but I really think she was doing 2 things with that. Her costumes were like disguises to let her be someone else and therefore it wasn't "her" that would be critiqued AND she gave bazillions of people he freedom and (more than) permission to just be themselves a screw whatever others think or say. Soooooo many props to this amazing woman.

LuvTadnDixie	2:34 -- 2:48 Look at Jackson Maine looking at Ally, so proud of his girl knocking em dead on stage.  It's actually Bradley Cooper looking at Gaga and feeling so happy he cast her in his film and so proud she's kickin' ass in his movie with her amazing vocals!  That's the look of a director who is very pleased.

S. O.	Everyone knows Gaga has a fine voice, but Cooper's rich, soulful singing here is a delightful surprise. The song is oddly structured. Every part of it is good but they're put together in a way that doesn't really make emotional sense to me.  But I'll wait till I see the movie on Tuesday to judge anything about it.

What will come from her in years and decades ahead will be legend...for millennia. Peace Everyone.

BlackWillow	1:46-2:07 is my favorite part as well as 2:35-2:47! I get so emotional at this part because her vocals are the most powerful and heartfelt.

A magnificent, wonderful, beautiful, amazing song that I’d love to listen to to chill out.

dan johnson	This is so far off my usual genre of music I listen to but you just have to appreciate it. Brad's voice is killer and Gaga's voice is as beautiful as she is. Everything makes this video, the chemistry, her vulnerability and even the audience. This is epic.

Lyricana Rokarin	Kind of surprised Lady Gaga let her real face be seen so much.  She normally works pretty hard to maintain her "persona".  Almost like she's afraid of people knowing she's just a regular girl underneath all the magic, glam and weirdness.  Edit:  To be clear, I like seeing her just be her.

ByManel25	se me ponen os pelos de punta me encanta esta canción buaaa
67DrWatson	I'm confused. You have someone with zero vocal talent starring in a film centred around someone with outstanding vocal talent?!  She really should stick to wearing those ridiculous outfits on the red carpet and leave the singing to the experts. The songs on the soundtrack will be basic just so that her voice can be fiddled with in the studio because they know she can't reach the soprano heights that Streisand did in the original. Her so-called 'fans' need to stop lying and admit that her voice is mediocre at best and she can neither act nor sing. Bradley Cooper has a better voice and that isn't even his craft.
Richard J Zambrana Toro	So deep.💔😫😭😍

Stephen Raitt	[Bradley Cooper:] Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Lady Gaga:] Tell me something boy Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I'm falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga:] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in I'll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us We're far from the shallow now  [Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We're far from the shallow now
Yannis Protopapas	Lady Gaga, simply America's greatest voice of the last 20 years! She is an incredible person, gifted with the talent of singing, composing and performing. Thank God that we people can have this blessing alive and giving her best of herself to the rest of us, also.
lale.	Deep song...really deep. I like that. Good Job, B.C & L.G!
GA CON CON	Gonna shout it from the mountaintops (A star is born) It's a time for pullin' out the stops (A star is born)  Honey, hit us with a Hallelu The kid came shinin' through Girl, sing the song Come blow your horn A star is born  He's a hero who can please the crowd (A star is born) Come on everybody, shout out loud (A star is born)  Just remember in the darkest hour Within your heart's the power For making you a hero too  So don't lose hope when you're forlorn Just keep your eyes upon the skies Every night a star is, right in sight is Burning bright, a star is born  Like a beacon in the cold dark night A star is born Told ya everything would turn out right A star is born Just when everything was all at sea The boy made history The bottom line, he sure can shine  His rising sign is Capricorn He knew how to He had a clue Telling you a star is born  Here's a hero who can please a crowd (A star is born) Come on everybody, shout out loud (A star is born) Just remember in the darkest hour Within your heart's the power For making you a hero too  So don't lose hope when you're forlorn Just keep your eyes upon the skies Every night a star is, right in sight a star is Burning bright, a star is born

carol p	All credits go to both Bradley and Gaga for the rebirth of a new story of the Star is Born. I'm really thrilled to be here listening to this. I was lucky enough to be here at 428 views and every hour or so I come to listen to this amazing song and every hour or so I see the view count rising so quickly. I have continued to be amazed to watch the views. 3,776,237 views since it's release. Well done to all the little baby monsters, the fans of both Gaga's and Bradley's.   I will see this, own this and watch it often. Brad, well done with the Directing, and voice coaching, it paid off, you sound so professional and both your voice and Gaga's blend beautifully. I'm so proud of you both, the cast and crew, production on a whole. I can't wait to see this film.  I'm in awe of you both. Gaga, you're beautiful in and out, don't ever forget it girl. Brad, keep doing what you do best, and now add 'singing & Directing to your repertoire. well done. Aussie Fan.

Fabrício D. Walker	Chances given to you  Hi honey, or maybe I should just say hello If you're here to apologize, know there's nothing else to do Nothing is going to work It's all over long ago, and you're here because you realized that what you had, you'll never have again Lift up your face to the heavens, watch the stars Count them, notice how numerous they are Understand that the number of times I cried for us Understand that the number of times I fought for us Understand that the number of times I've tried to make you smile These numbers These numbers are larger than the number of stars you just told  While I cried and lowered my head, every time, I was giving you chances to perceive Even so, you preferred things for the moment, things that do not last a day Enjoy, look at the stars and count them  You can try twice the number of stars, but you'll never reach me. Because now for you, I'm no longer on Earth, I'm in the stars Remembering all the times that I only wanted our good, but baby I do not want this love with anyone any more But I'm not alone, I'm with the stars. Counting them and reminding me of all the times All the times All the times  Some stars have fallen, but their chances are still the same Like me here, nothing in a million Nothing will work Now turn your face to Earth, it's your place, stay there, you've always been 'down to earth' Better look where you walk I'll stay here, counting the stars.

LaDonna Louise	I talked to my son about this movie.  he said it's just a  media grab for money.  I said no honey, this has been made FIVE times now.  and every single one had a major impact in every generation.   He said I had no idea this was made many times.  I think Gaga is amazing in this, and I can't wait to see it.  it is a deep heartfelt tale about love, success, failure, talent and the depth of life.  i can't wait. in the original wen the husband comes in drunk to the awards ceremony for his wife, and he hits a man, but he actually misses and hits his wife who he really loves, and she recovers and showers him with love..... well... it's a great movie.  it really is.

Gavin Reddig	I bet they start off happy. Then a conflict arises. Then they go back to being happy
Brendan Schaub	She's a fucking weirdo. Go do some real research you fools. She's a celebrity elitist. Didn't you see that little performance she pulled off ? Took her about an hour to walk to her car which was 2 meters in front of her. Her ex body guard said she threatened to eat him. She';s a drugged out black magic dabbling piece of shit who makes money off of children that aren't old enough to realize. Lady Gaga is nothing more than an elitist piece of shit who dabbles in weird weird weirdddddd stuff. You know nothing and you're so ignorant you wouldn't even bother to go look up what i'm talking about, until you do you can live in your dream world. They're all cunts.

Bobby Flores	Did anybody else get shivers?
David Pacheco	Loved it! I think that "Song of the Year" at Oscar time will go to one of the songs from the movie. Hopefully she'll win an Oscar even if it was for music but the way they're talking she might have a chance at "Best Actress". So happy for her. I'm not a "Little Monster" but a fan.
El Encantador	Yaass Kween!! You kill it !😍😍
Brendon Johnston	Chills....and I don't even listen to country music.
Dalyssa Sali15	THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!! 💙🎶😭 I'm anxious to watch!
Monica De La Rosa	Her voice is terrible. I'm the only one not kissing her ass here. Bradley Cooper would overpower her shitty voice if she wasn't yelling in the mic. I can't believe they went from Judy Garland and Barbara Streisand to Lady Caca.

ardvarksfromhell	4th film of a star is born when will Hollywood stop making remakes
TheTruthiest	I get that this is Lady Gaga's channel and she's the professional singer here, but I feel Bradley Cooper really deserves more props here for his singing on this song. Gaga's reaction at 0:36 is how I was when I was hearing this for the first time.
• Tainá •	😍😍😍😍

Marcelo Matiello	It's so nice to see Lady Gaga in her human form. You know what I mean? She presents herself in that over the top strange bizarre form that I always see on her vidos and shows. And it's nice to see her in a clean ,normal look for a change. She should keep that  up.

AJisnumerouno	His voice is horrible lol, wtf are you people on. Hers is great though.
MP Fann	[[EDIT]] I was wrong, been listening to this song on loop for two hours and I love it. DAMN, GaGa PUNCHES that mic with her voice. She’s everything and all.   Man, I have been EAGERLY looking forward to this soundtrack, but Yikes - this song is all over the place. There’s something about the mixing, the transitions, and the vocals that hits my ears wrong. It’s a lot better than I could’ve done, though.   Plus, the underlying noise of the audience is an unnecessary distraction and takes away from the song; it sounds dubbed. Now, if they did what Streisand insisted on and recorded everything live, then I understand the background noise.

Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  [Refrain: Lady Gaga] I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times, I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now

Yo opino que	Yo no escucho a Lady Gaga, la conozco porque fue popular por diversas causas, de hecho he visto más el trabajo actoral de Bradley Cooper, jamás que ellos dos terminaran trabajando juntos.

[Refrain: Lady Gaga] I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times, I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-ha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We’re far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low In the sha-ha-ha-la-la-la-low In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low We’re far from the shallow now

Zach Martin	Please people come to Islam and don't listen to this music it's bad for your soul. These "music" videos are a distraction from the Path of Allah (God) because satan wants to distract us all our life's and falling into immorality while Allah (God) wants the best for us so Allah can give us a Eternal Paradise A.K.A Heaven. That's why Allah gives us the Quran to guide us to the straight path so we can live a good life and be  good people 😄.  Please become a Muslim before the Day Of Judgement occurs and there will be no coming back and that day is getting closer and closer every day because we're living in the end times. If you disagree with me that's fine I respect your opinion  May Allah guide you to Islam and know I'm just a warner

Lil Mayo	Here's the ending:  Bradley cooper was madly in love with Lady Gaga but then, he found out she   was actual a guy.   He found out when he turned the lights on after she kept insisting for them to be off during sex.  He then was in a badly accident after drunk driving due to depression and PTSD from the whole Lady Gaga situation.   It was only then when some mad scientist found and recovered cooper. Which then he had to do the one and only thing to save his life!  Which was to reassemble his body into another one with different body parts. Luckily cooper was alive and recovering,   He is now known as "Rocket" from Gaurdians Of The Galaxy.

caleidoscopio	I didnt like Lady Gaga at all when she started. It was all about performance and not about music. Im so happy she decided to change and stay with her passion and be herself, she is enough talented to do weird things to get attention. Maybe she doesnt get that much fame as she used in the first years but now she is admired for everyone as a really artist for her music. I hope her the best!

Marvin Fischer	Okay. First I thought that the song is way worse than I hoped, but you have to take your time. Just, don't listen to Shallow by the way. Lay down, put your Earphones on, drink a glass wine and do nothing else than listening to this song. Take your moment and listen to the instruments and to the voices.

And who knew Bradley Cooper could sing?! WHAT THE  FUCK?! Kudos to them both on a beautiful song. I smell Oscar nominations!

mlzanercik	(JESUS; THE ALMIGHTY!!!):  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness  he doth judge  and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written,  that no man knew,  but he himself. And he was clothed with  a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.  (Revelation 19:11-13).  _________________________________________________ Behold, he cometh with clouds;  and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth  shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  I am Alpha and Omega,  the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is,  and which was,  and which is to come, the Almighty.  (Revelation 1:7-8).  ________________________________________________ (JESUS):  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and,  behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys  of hell  and of death.  (Revelation 1:18).

francesco spatola	TRADUZIONE ITALIANO  Dimmi una cosa, ragazza  Sei felice in questo mondo moderno?  O hai bisogno di più?  C'è qualcos'altro che stai cercando?  Sto precipitando  In tutti i bei momenti mi ritrovo a desiderare il cambiamento  E nei brutti momenti ho paura di me stesso  Dimmi qualcosa di ragazzo  Non sei stanco cercando di riempire quel vuoto  O hai bisogno di più?  Non è difficile resistere così tenacemente  Sto precipitando  In tutti i bei momenti mi ritrovo a desiderare il cambiamento  E nei brutti momenti ho paura di me stesso  Sono fuori di testa, guardo mentre mi tuffo  Non incontrerò mai il terreno  Crolla attraverso la superficie, dove non possono farci del male  Siamo lontani dal superficiale adesso  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Siamo lontani dal superficiale adesso  Wooaaaah  Woaaaaaaaaaaah  Sono fuori di testa, guardo mentre mi tuffo  Non incontrerò mai il terreno  Crolla attraverso la superficie, dove non possono farci del male  Siamo lontani dal superficiale adesso  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Nel superficiale, superficiale  Siamo lontani dal superficiale adesso

Adam Pinkerton	Wow, never knew Rick Grimes had such a great voice!
Jennifer Oliveira	Sempre achei a Gaga especial, um símbolo da música popular, uma mulher empoderada com alguns "não me toque", normal pela posição. A primeira vez que vi o trailer, a reconheci antes dela subir no palco e soltar a voz, me arrepiei quando isso aconteceu. Vê-la tão humana encheu meus olhos. Fiquei viciada no trailer e hoje vi o anúncio do longa nos telões de Pinheiros em São Paulo e fiquei tão maravilhada! As pessoas precisam saber o q essa mulher pode fazer e o quão talentosa ela é.

Amy Higgins	I got the opportunity to go to the official press screening of this film before it’s out on general release in early October and I can honestly say that it is HANDS DOWN one of the best films I have ever seen. Both Bradley and lady Gaga were amazing and their chemistry was one of the most believable chemistry in any film I’ve seen. If you get the chance to see this film WATCH IT! I can’t stop thinking about it since I’ve seen it and I can’t wait to go watch it again once it gets released. All the songs are amazing too! Ugh so good!!

Jaelen Sandoval	Lady Gaga was such a good actress in A Star is Born, I was crying in the theater like an idiot lmao. She’s been through a lot in her career, and seeing her as vulnerable as ever in this film because she could relate to her character so much literally had me so shook. Everyone should watch this, whether it’s for Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga, or because you like the concept and plot of the movie. It’s simply amazing!

Tramaine Terrance	Hello, Humans. In the words of the great Michael Jordan- "I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."  ~Michael Jordan   TERRANCE OUT

Leopold Valdez	Hey earth...🌌 Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to make music. Not to become famous. But to spread the best vibes I know of to the world. Why? Cuz I never really had a good life, I lived in a garage for years, all my clothes were from a thrift stores/hand me downs.... And thru all that, the only thing that got me through it was music and hope... The hope that one day it could change. I was and still am desperate for good vibes and change. And to me music is the best way to spread vibes, that's why I started making it. So that if anyone is down or is living a unvibe life, I could hopefully spread some amazing vibes to the, I just wanna help anyone who's life is bad an feels like there's no hope .. cuz I know what that feels like , and it was certain music that got me thru it and made my world change. I wanna be that for someone. Have a beautiful day 🙏🌌

Cuando pasaba horas con ansiedad de hacer todo, de mostrar y complacer a los demás, recuerdo cuando Gaga dijo que se permitía fallar, equivocarse ... Y ahí descubrí perdía parte de mi, que tenía que soltar cadenas. Esta mujer sabe que es ser feliz, a pesar de todo.. Ella ahora es libre y así lo transmite.

Além de cantar, compor, dançar, atuar e tocar instrumentos musicais, Gaga é um ser humano incrível que sempre se posicionou a favor das minorias e dos direitos da comunidade LGBTI.   Que orgulho de você, mulher!   Espero ansiosamente para te ver nos cinemas. ❤️

Deidra Key	I just love how well she plays this scared little girl new to the stage which is completely opposite of who she is now

Eduardo Avila	Es tan hermosa !!!
M Nb	She's the best I love her so much
RED	I've been a fan of her since Paparazzi and not going to lie I feel both happy and sad right now. I love that she's soo established and the public is finally accepting her talent. It just makes me feel sad that when she was doing the crazy outfits and videos she was just seen as a weirdo yet she always had that talent... It's so upsetting. People pick and chose what they like and that's messed up. Either way can't wait for this movie, go GAGA!!

Mark 8:36-38 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? 37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 38 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

Beverly	Was never a fan of Lady Gaga's style of music but knew she had a voice on her. Can't wait for the soundtrack on this one ...
Chuck Hollis	I have always appreciated Lady Gaga, but never would have considered myself a fan.  Pleasant stuff to listen to, but ... not my thing.  I'm a performing musician, so I'm permitted to have my preferences.  This song (and movie) has re-arranged the equation for me, and likely a lot of other people like me.  Here, she is a natural talent: no makeup, costumes, etc.  No 20 member synth band behind her.  No light show.  Just her (and some artful production values) just vaulted her to my inner pantheon.    I would pay good money to go see something like this. Just like I would with Adele, etc.  Google is kind enough to show me shows around Dec 30 in Vegas.  I'd love to know what she has in mind, just sayin'.  If it's the "new Gaga" count me in.  I now very much forward look forward to what she does next.  Sign me up.

Alan Yeap	Muito orgulhoso de acompanhar desde o início a jornada dessa grande artista que Lady Gaga é. A visão e construção de cada álbum,   a contextualização com os temas da atualidade, as referências a sua própria carreira. Uma artista visionária que já sabia para onde iria (no videoclipe paparazzi já premeditou  sua nova ascensão em musicais), estudou a arte da fama, tendo a capacidade vocal pra qualquer estilo musical, de jazz a eletro, e um senso estético impecável e provocativo. Apenas orgulhoso de tê-la como ídolo. Além de tudo, um exemplo como ser humano que admiro: encoraja a empatia, bondade e verdade. LADY FUCKING GAGA! ⭐

Peeker 1979	I love Lady Gaga. I love the way she gives herself 100% into a song she sings. This song stirs my emotions. I love the fact that Bradley Cooper contributes so perfectly into the song as well. I cannot wait until I see this movie. I was a big fan of the 1976 version of the film. From what I see so far, this movie will be just as great as that one. Maybe even better.

Cindy Chang	[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper] Tell me somethin' girl Are you happy in this modern world? Or do you need more? Is there somethin' else you’re searchin' for?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longin' for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Verse 2: Lady Gaga] Tell me something boy Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void? Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  [Bridge: Lady Gaga] Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  [Chorus: Lady Gaga] I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  [Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper] In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now

craig thomas scott	Strange? I couldn't watch using link. Yet some how managed to using earlier link via apple? Daughter uses two hands to blow kiss and of course I catch them. She then tells me I am meant to catch the kiss and not her. So she instructs me to step further away and do it properly. This time I do catch her blow kiss with afew steps added backwards. She almost blows me away. I tell her I think it safer to just give her a kiss on the cheek. But no, I have to blow her a kiss. I stand on my mark and with as much air force as I can muster I try as I might to blow a kiss that could knock her off her feet as she dose me.

Ra Mórffon	Caralhoooo fode mesmo ... dlc de música
Jon Doeringer	Her earlier costumes and makeup turned me off. The Tony Bennett ad got me curious. I realized she can actually sing. And just watching this clip, I can see she knows how to act, too. I believed every moment of her face.  And that face - am I finally getting used to it? She looks so much better without makeup! Looks like I'll be seeing version 3 of 'Star'. The movie with a rough 3rd act. Cooper looked very natural too, as a musician.

Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?  I’m falling In all the good times I find myself longing for change And in the bad times I fear myself  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  Wooaaaah Woaaaaaaaaaaah  I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never meet the ground Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now  In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now

Jebbie	*Great song! We already knew Gaga could sing the phone book & sound amazing but who knew Brad Cooper could sing¡?¡ This'll be the 3rd remake of "A Star Is Born". The original film was in 1937 w/ Janet Gaynor & Frederic March. 2nd 1954 w/ Judy Garland & James Mason. 3rd 1976 w/ Barbra Streisand & Kris Kristofferson. I generally don't like remakes but I'm actually looking forward to seeing this one.*

Muchos tiempo despues de pasado su mejor momento en su carrera recien pude darme cuenta lo grandiosa que es como cantante esta mujer. Hoy veo sus shows en vivo y videos musicales de años atras y es maravillosa la forma en como se entrega a su arte y no dudo que en esta pelicula no se haya comprometido al maximo. Que genial, encima a lado Bradley que es un grande.  Va ser un pelicula para ver mas de una vez, eso sí, seguro.

Stefan Ackermann	Can’t wait to see the movie, but did they really have to go with a live version  for the music video? I get it. She plays a character who writes music and doesn’t sing her own songs, so she’s not supposed to sound like a professional singer, which is great for the character and was a great idea. But I hope the soundtrack has actual studio versions where she sounds like Lady Gaga, not Allie.
