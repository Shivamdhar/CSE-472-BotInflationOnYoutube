Born2RiffRock	I work at Walmart. I don't wait to be told to take out trash or mop my floors in electronics to make my department look clean and neat. I zone and stock to keep shelves full for customers to buy. I want my own store. I am an older college degree  guy but I don't care I don't smoke or drink and in good health. I am determined to get my own store to maintain and run.  GREAT VIDEO SPOT ON ADVISE
Ajmal Soltan	I’m a Walmart manager and I 100% agree with everything he says. I started as a cashier work my way up to a Co-manager. Walmart is a great company. Opportunities are their you just have to strive for excellence. 4 basic belief respect for individual, service our customer, strive for excellence and act with integrity.

Lucio DiDavide	Sensei Fitzpatrick, as a new worker going in with the intention to grow within one of these big companies, should you outline your intentions at the interview for the entry level job?

NPC #8764344	Dear god.. Those views.. Those likes and dislikes ratios. Sir, you may be the most fake youtube I've seen.
woo bear	go to macclenny walmart in north florida  usa, the cart pusher there was the most popular person, in the store, they fired him for working  his freinds schedule, he was a demi god, and nobody new about it.....  he cursed the store, never to run cart machine again, they now push carts without a cart machine, it is there karma for what they had did to this man, he should of been ranked up  ...instead of bullied or dominated lol
Baby James	Too many people go into these type jobs with the wrong attitude which makes it very hard for them to advance. People will say things like "I'm not kissing butt" which is the dumbest attitude one can have. If you're going to advance it'll take favor/likeability from the people above you! It's that simple.
Daniel Toye	This guy obviously never worked at Walmart 
D Man	I work at Walmart for ten years I was making sixteen dollars a hour I walk away from it the company doesn't care for the worker I seen twenty year management and associate let go just to hire three or for other people and pay them less there are over work and under paid this video a joke
John Booker's Full spectrum	walmart helps to enslave prisoners. actual citizens  held captive in the country of china. they can't leave china or search for other employment. we who shop at walmart, are no better than the peoples of passed centuries who benefited from the African slave trades cheap inexpensive products. shame on all of us.
Frost	It is demeaning when you make 7 dollars an hour part time and its not an "entry" to anything but a dead end job when walmart purposely keeps you poor. Anyone who defends Walmart is an idiot. Walmart exists for ONE purpose: To make the waltons rich.
General Manager	Does Wal-Mart allow over-time? ? ? 
saintgauden	If you really want anything, in this lifetime, before your productive years are used up, you will need to work for yourself.  Working for someone else for most of your life simply will not "cut it."  Yeah, you will earn salary increases over time (maybe), but by the time you reach "good money" your body will be falling apart and the medical industry will take it all away from you.
