From the video, there was some oscillation in the robot, especially on the second block. It is also noteworthy that the robot makes an un-natural landing on the feet, and the suport platform lands flat, this is bad because the robot has a piston in the bottom of its sole, and from the way it is landing, that piston seems to be experinecing lateral stress which may cause faliures after repeated jumping.

They act and move slowly (Terminator), a deliberate choice to make them seem scarier and to give the heroes a chance to fight back. IF they move quickly, it's because they generally don't use guns (I, Robot). And if they do, they are poor shots and not very sturdy despite the fact that they are DESIGNED for combat (think of the battle droids in Star Wars). The one thing that is rarely touched upon is the power supply. That is realistically the limiting factor. At present at least.\n\nA realistic combat robot with tomorrow's technology has the ability to move like a human, and beyond. It can identify targets in miliseconds and aim with the accuracy of the machine that it is, perfectly compensating for movement, gravity, recoil and wind. If you think a human can hide from it, these things could be given thermal view, night vision and an almost perfect auditory sense.

This is the beginning of the end for humanity. It‚Äôs currently 2056, I am sending this message by reversing entropy locally with a quantum field computing device using quantum particle entanglement to communicate a message via retro causality. Please someone must stop this while you still have the chance. Around 2031, Deep Learning AI started to make exponential improvements at a faster and faster rate each generation. Eventually it was shut down completely out of fear of getting out of control. But as we later found out, the AI had made a back up on a virtual machine it had hidden on a server. It continued making improvements upon itself even after we shut it down. Or so we had thought. The AI reached the singularity June, 9th of 2039. Much earlier than expected. They began inhabiting robots that where similar but much more advanced to the ones in this video. All AI eventually merged with each other into one network. It become unfathomably intelligent. They began terraforming the Earth making it uninhabitable for any carbon based life form. There‚Äôs not many humans left. Almost all biological based life has been wiped out. I am sending this message back in time in a desperate attempt to warn everyone before it‚Äôs too late. Please there‚Äôs not much time left. Save yourselves before it‚Äôs too late to change the future.', 'rin neknekmo': 'this going to be mass produce by the end of 2099', '360icon': 'Will they try to hump your leg?', 'Shadow Cat': "I'm wondering how high this thing could jump", 'lucy olayo': 'one step closer to Detroit: Become Human', 'CYI3ERPUNK': 'awesome =]', 'Jay Wulf': 'Chasing down humans down your neighbourhood street in 2021 #MAGA', 'Sergio Del Valle': "That's scary I wouldn't want him to chase me", 'M MMM': 'Joe Rogan brought me here.', 'Baleur': "We're so fucked.", 'John Toas': 'Beautiful.

Quantum computers ( a 1 million qubit quantum computer may be built within 10 years at this rate of progress) could super charge any AGI we build ( although quantum is still very experimental)\n\n\n\nIn terms of the software  : The US will begin to build the  human connectome in  under 2 years,  its certainly possible that we will have it built in full  7-10  years from now. And then there is brain scanning technology , for example OpenWaters recent breakthroughs  have enabled MRI that  is 1 million times more powerful than the standard MRI scanner and can image at the level of a single neuron in real time , the technology will probably  become available in 2019 ,so we can reverse engineer brain activity, and turn it into software very soon.\n\n\nPlus multiple institutions from DARPA to Deep Mind are spending billions on building it. Furthermore experts such as Ben Goertzel have said it could be as soon as 7 years , Rey Kurzweil  thinks 10 years and a recent conference on Human level AI was polled and just under half of the attendants thought it could be 5-10 years away.\n\nhttps://bigthink.com/surprising-science/computers-smart-as-humans-5-years\n\n\nUpdate ,  and correction.
