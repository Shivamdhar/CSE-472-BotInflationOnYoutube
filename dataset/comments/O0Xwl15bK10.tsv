Adoma Geraldine	I love you 😋😍😘 but l have a guy Hahaha see you again nice song
Sam Oppong R.	Sarkodie want's Strongman to be recognized for his unprecedented talent and not for his influence as Sarkodie. That is how much the King believes in him. Many people arguing how he doesn't take him to the shows he is booked for and so forth. He doesn't want him to be living in his shadows.
Òbaapà Stinzy	too much🔥🔥

K. Maali	No flow this year can be compared💥
Mishael Agyei-Boamah	Okay, no hating here. He wanted to sound clever but ended up missing the target a lot of the time with his punches 1. Girl no y3 tall koraa; boys y3 blackberry, boys y3 bold. ( I get trying to be witty with 'Blackberry Bold' talk but that meant nothing) 2. "Girl no ne heel/hill na egu tantra" is utterly meaningless. (by the way make nobody tell me sey e bi Tantra Hill reference) 3. Nana, wo police mma ky3n Central. Another clueless bar ( Don't tell me he is referring to Central Police) 4. Na me nyini no mehu s3 )bra y3 b4. Charley )bra y3 bonah. (This one was close enough to its intended meaning 'B4Bonah' but still didn't land) 5. Ma me dough ah, na w'aso ay3 s3 Bajie was clever. Very hilarious bar. Good bar! 6. Wo a run girls anya diarrhea could've been put better Track could've been better without all these cringey bars. Like Sark said, 'Wo taa punch pii aah, you sound immature.' Okay song, could've been better. No hate though. Still proud of how far he has come
Kwame Ever	💯
Belinda Esiape	Most Ghanaian will never understand rap music and music in general. To them it's just entertainment. What's this rap about? I finished listening without grabbing the concept and it lacks serious content... U guys better stop the sugar quoting and praises and be real for once. Let's push our artists to do more because what they put out there is a reflection of who we are.. Sark don't want to see this guy make it he keeps him low so he can ride above. Sark y3 p3s3 minko menya, abr) and always wants to see only him on top. Couldn't he have helped strongman make better music with all his resources? This get 1 out of 10 for me..... the boys are not learning at all u guys stop bumping ur heads, analyze things before u comment pls the allo praises are too much.

Oscar Fiifi	@strongman: This is what Im talking about! Craziest verses on craziest beats especially danceable tunes. DJs of all sorts will play and hype a danceable tune song with crazy rap. Sark climbed up after his Baby and Lay Away hit songs which all had crazy raps and sick beats. You got our hearts just catch a feet to dance more. Its a showbiz and the world is expecting more. We love the hip hop but we got to dance as well.

I dont mind listening to this tune all day, cos I love rap.. I mean I really do love rap music... but how many ppl will listen to that all day? they will move on to the next danceable tune right after ... you are a better rapper than medikal.. but do u know what medikal does better? he comes up with some hook that will get anyone singing along and that is what u need to do strongee
