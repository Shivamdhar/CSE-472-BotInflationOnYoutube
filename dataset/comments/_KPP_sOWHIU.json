And he pretty much choked in game 1 and 2. Game 1 only 8 points in second half and in game 2 I can‚Äôt recall. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is I can see why AD says stuff like he‚Äôs the best player and why people could argue that KD is better. Lebron lacks the clutch gene. Or rather he doesn‚Äôt embrace it. It‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt be clutch he lacks the balls to be clutch. Being clutch don‚Äôt mean you make all the shots but it means you always try. He has shied away countless times. Also if you if you notice when he does make a last second shot he always looks so extremely delighted and surprised or he basks in it because it‚Äôs such an anomaly for him. He sent the game into over time with a clutch shot but majority of the time he will pass it off. And hate or love skip he is right about Lebron. He knows Lebron is an amazingly gifted athlete but he also sees that mentally of all the people in the GOAT convo he is the weakest. See game 1 when the moron JR made that faux pas Lebron sulked and crumbled. Jordan would have said fuck y‚Äôall and taken over the game in overtime. Same with Kobe. What did Lebron do. Didn‚Äôt score any points for 90% of overtime coz he was demoralized. GOATs don‚Äôt get demoralized. You could argue that Lebron is the best today. But if Jordan and Kobe were around at their peak right now or even when Lebron was at his (some would say he is) Lebron would be in their shadow. He has zero fighting spirit. I actually like Lebron but after game 1 of playoffs I saw the side that skip talks about. On a side note; the lakers starting 5 should be MCGEE (who has been brilliant), Lebron, kuzma/Ingram and Lonzo and Hart. KCP and Rondo should be dropped. Also Rondo is conflicting with Lebron. You can‚Äôt have two leaders. Finally see what Lebron said at end of match. He knows what he got himself into. Dude own up you lost the game.

The rythym he plays with at times is "clunky" for a lack of a better word, and seems to leave his teammates in bad positions. If you looked at the team on the floor as a well oiled machine, LeBron is this oddity in the machine that sometimes runs well but other times your like, "i payed a lot of money for you to make my machine run better but you\'re not doing what the brochure said you\'d do. Your actually clogging my machine up and i may take you out because of how inconsistent of a component you are". It\'s like he\'s thinking way too much instead of just playing in the flow to the best of his ability. He does that and the Laker\'s become more consistent and successful.

He fouled out 2 of LAs bigs and was able to take advantage of the Lakers small ball lineup down the stretch. Clutch rebounds, and enough long 2s to keep the Lakers on their toes. \n\nBryn Forbes, the Sniper, the sleeper, the guy with the same last name of a magazine that talks about money all the fuckin time. Just so happens to be MONEY when the game is on the line. And he is FEARLESS, because Pop has given him the go ahead to shoot whenever the fuck he is open. Something that Murray cannot do. So although his defense is lacking, his effort and skill as a shooter plays into his advantage and alot of you lakers fans probably never knew just how good he is as a shooter. You will know soon enough. He doesn't shoot airballs like Lonzo. He shot 77/100 3s in front of Popovich when he first joined the Spurs. To prove that he can shoot. He now has more minutes until Walker and white return this season. \n\nRudy Gay... Clutch AF! We dont need to explain his ability. He gets buckets! Now healthy on the spurs, he has seen more wide open looks than ever before. His efficiency is going to be consistent. The clutch 3 at the end that put SA behind by 1, the Hammer play with his friend DeRozan at the corner; his consistency being able to shoot over tall defenders at midrange. The man is putting in WORK. \n\nDeMar DeRozan, 14 assists and 30+ points. A tough brotha no doubt, able to take contact and make his free throws consistently. He is a grade A competitor and so far he is showing his final form with San Antonio. Especially with a 14 assist career high in what is just the 3RD GAME OF THE SEASON. He even made a good amount of 3 pointers and looked comfortable doing so.\n\nWelcome to the new look spurs. Our defense is not as good without Leonard and Green, no shit.
