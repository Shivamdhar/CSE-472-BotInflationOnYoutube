Please don't hate me)\n\nFor starters ( pun intended), even though Torterra is weak to Infernape, the best Infernape can do for a while is flame wheel, which is easily tankable thanks to it's bulky defence. Yes, special attacks cripple it, but would you actually see an Infernape use a special move?\n\nSecond, moves like Giga Drain can be helpful as it sacrifices a bit of power for the ability to heal. Curse could also be viable as it's already slow as heck, why not just up it's other stats instead ( I used only grottle to beat gardenia using curse so it's a good early game option) What I'm saying is that not all pokemon have to only have attacking moves. Synthesis could also be another option.\n\nThird, many pokemon could be used to build a team around as the vast amount of TMs that can be put on certain pokemon covers most of Torterra's weaknesses. Personally, getting an altaria in this gen is extremely useful as it can be taught moves like ice beam and earthquake , giving it to Gallade it kind of a waste as fighting moves cover some of the things that earthquake is super effective againts ( Steel, rock etc) Even if you Have some other weaknesses, your fire type ( or in my instance a clefable with flamethrower) can deal with those threats for you.\n\nFinally, I think that torterra is a pokemon for more advanced players to use. It's tanky nature makes it difficult to grasp for the less experienced players, making Infernape as good as it is kind of an easy mode for the game. Understanding that not all pokemon are fast sweepers makes it easier to appreciate how good Torterra is ( Not saying to don't expect all pokemon to be fast sweepers, it's just your preferance). \n\nI hope that you appreciate what I was saying.

It\'s not only a TORTOISE (again, not a turtle) but it\'s also a CONTINENT. Both are known for moving slow, and continents can cause limitless amounts of destruction no matter how fast they move.

Steel wing if you are ok with using single use tms on your pokemon.\n3. Why leaf blade and earthquake on gallade since you have such type coverage on your starter? you can use x scissor for coverage on gallade which is a tm you can reobtain later in battle points. For the 4th attack, you can use slash, night slash, even false swipe to be able to catch pokemon and possibly hypnosis also for sleeping them and catching pokemon, but does not work if you used worry seed by your starter.\n4. Houndoom, why physical attacks on him when the special attack is better than attack, instead do flamethrower, dark pulse, nasty plot, and sludge bomb or shadow ball.\n5. Lickylicky or possibly just use Bibarel and give it the remaining hms you need.\n6. For a water type, I don't like what magikarp evolves into. Pick another water type such as floatzel. Can teach it a water hm if you can't fit all your hms on the other pokemon such as bibarel. You can use waterfall on floatzel while bibarel can get surf, floatzel can learn ice fang and crunch, and you can give it the non buyable tm iron tail.\nAfter some analysis, it has come to be known that 2 types can hit the entire national dex including modern generations of pokemon either neutral damage or super effective. Those types are ghost and fighting, the same type as marshadow, this also applies to earlier generations since the 7th generation is the most type diverse generation and this condition still applies. But not for inversion battles in the newer games.", 'Deth Troy': 'you know since your on a sinnoh kick, why not remake the infernape team video and give us move lists?

Why teach Gallade Eq when it has Close Combat and Psycho Cut? That coverage hits the exact same types except electric. It would be better to teach Eq to Gyarados so that it can beat the electric types that threaten it. Sword Dance in Gallade makes it insanely strong.\n\nIn place of Take Down, I’d give Staraptor Return. It’s better in every way. The only downside to it is that it depends on happiness/friendship so I’d wait before actually using the tm. I think you can check if happiness is maxed out by talking to the person in the house on the beach before Pastoria City. If it’s maxed then you will get a ribbon.\n\nNot sure why you would even consider using Lickylicky. If you need a Surf user I recommend Vaporeon or Gastrodon. Then can also learn Ice Beam. They are both good since they are insanely bulky. Gastrodon might be the better choice because it has a better typing as it is part ground so its immune to electric. Plus it gets Recover at level 54.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve used Houndoom before in Platinum and I think that it’s pretty useless. Sure it beats Byron, Candice and Aaron, but so does Torterra, Staraptor and Gallade. The only reason you’re using it is for Lucian and in my experience Houndoom does badly against him. I find that it’s too slow and gets OHKOed by Focus Blast which every member of his team has. And even if he misses and you land a Dark Pulse, the damage isn’t that great and by the end of the turn you will be hoping that he misses the next Focus Blast. To replace it I would use Drapion. To be honest I’ve never actually used one in Platinum but I think that it would do better because it’s better for beating Lucian which is Houndoom’s only job. It has a better typing which leaves it with one weakness. It gets Crunch at level 49 and Toxic Spikes at level 28.
