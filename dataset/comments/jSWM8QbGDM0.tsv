mke gage	This is some wild stuff!  This is truly remarkable.  Not only is Reggie the hardest working person in crypto, he is also bringing on board all the right people to get Veritaseum to where it belongs,  the Veri top!!.  The genius of Reggie shines not only in the product itself, but in the hiring of his staff.   I see that it takes genius to recognize genius.... Bravo Team Veritaseum!!  Veri is going back to top of my list of coins to HODL!!
