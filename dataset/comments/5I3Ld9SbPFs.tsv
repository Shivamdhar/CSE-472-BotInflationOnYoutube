You are pure at heart and you absolutely love your job and truly appreciate your support. For most content creators I can’t feel even close to the love and appreciation like you put through your work. Keep up the good videos man. Never give up. God bless you.   Btw would keep Henry and sell blanc and save up a bit longer for gullit.

Atta Rehman	Love your videos man, you and Nep, both. Pretty average player here, I got 14-14 in weekend league. Used to play squad battles earlier, but the furthest I can go there is elite 1, so for me, it’s too much investment of time and the rewards aren’t as fruitful as they are if you play division rivals or the weekend league. So I prefer just competing in rivals and the weekend league.

Jake Feasby	Yo Skillz, I absolutely love FIFA but I can’t afford/I’m not aloud to go FIFA 19😥. Any tips that I could get to improve? I currently play FIFA 18 squad battles on Professional difficulty but I can’t seem to improve. How can I get better? It would be great if you could reply❤️😅

Jonatan Austad	GET FIGO FOR HENRY!!
Frank Taylor	I just find squad battles hella boring
Nathan Hollow	If you want to entertain us then give us poor man to glory, we don't care about t100 rewards or seeing good players. It's fun to go side by side in not spending a single penny on the game and going through a struggle to get good placements in champs. I have a feeling you're wanting to go pro, no way it's because you want to show us these players because you change like 1 or 2 players every week.
Sebastian Wike	Love you Skillz❤️❤️❤️
Luuk De Busschere	buy 88 seedorf
Connor Charleston	I don't understand why offline is frowned upon. Even when you're playing against an actual person, 10/11 players on that person's team is being played by the AI. You have to understand the AI more than the player
