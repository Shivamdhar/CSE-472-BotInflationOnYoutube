Rebekah Robbins	Very humorous motivational speech
Kshitij Shravan	Better don't praise yourself in your videos, if you are worthy it will come to you.
Waseem Sahi	Over 500K people watched this video and some still have average opinion about him. Sir your advice is great...very encouraging, keep doing the good work.
Peter Nygren	TOTAL BULLSHIT!!!!  What does he REALLY mean by networking?  He means BE RICH. Be a trust fund baby. Have mommy and daddy support you. Have mommy and daddy live near a big metropolitan city.  Businesses value EXPERIENCE above education. But they only consider the UNPAID INTERNSHIP to be relevant experience.  If you cannot afford to work FOR FREE, no amount of "networking" is going to help you. You will NEVER get a decent paying job. NEVER.
runningshoe1000	I am a architect student and what he offers is more valuable that education itself, what I mean is he has practical advice that will help anyone find a career they want, we just have to become more aware of our situation and work from the bottom up. Reach for your goals America! Too many of us have taken for granted our education...if you have an education use it!!! Most people in other countries don't have this opportunity. We are America for goodness sakes. We can send people into outer space, gee whizzzzz, do something for humanity and something your actually good at. Period!!!
bob otto	This guy is a Pig Fucker
Adam Davis	I'm not one of your principal champions. But played your video and other people's to motivate my jobless brother. I thought yours was basic common since.  But it does seem like common since is becoming more and more less common. 
Rex Spencer	GOD I HATE THIS GUY!!!
M GULRAIZ	Angry man
kasim serunyigo	thanks
Jesus was a Carpenter	make it shorter and try saying something useful....
Ronald Dot'o	There is little to no demand for American workers dumb ass.  Wake up.  Friends and Family plan.  Networking doesn't work, people wont stick their neck out for you!  
manee paku kambu	Thank you sir
Deepak Shukla	I saw that you were commenting upon a similar video. We do those at the CV Guy - if you get a chance do stop by :)
Paul Knittle	Strong work ethics.  This leads to problems with coworkers.  Coworkers then spend time trying to get you fired.  If two coworkers form a cartel they and smear you to losing your job. 
IMJW1000	Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.—2 Pet. 2:9.  Suppose you are looking for a job. If you live in a land where work is scarce, you might be tempted to accept the first job offer—any offer—that comes along. What, though, if the nature of the work conflicts with Bible principles? What if the schedule or traveling involved will impede your Christian activity or take you away from your family? Should you accept the offer anyway, thinking that an unsuitable job is better than no job? Remember, choosing the wrong path could distance you from Jehovah. (Heb. 2:1) Keep in mind your destination. Ask yourself, ‘Where do I want a job or career to take me?’ If you view secular work as a means to an end—to support yourself and your family in Jehovah’s service—Jehovah will bless your efforts. (Matt. 6:33) Jehovah is not stumped when you face a job loss or an unexpected economic downturn.—Isa. 59:1. 
Daniel Schimmel	I see nothing wrong with asking for donations to be able continue his work.  The people who criticize this guy are the very slugs living off of mom and dad's donations.  What he says is true.  
Jane S	A millionaire investor will teach you how to be successful like him, then asks for donations from the poor shmucks who have less. Credibility = gone.
tubeberk08	ask us to buy the book....but a donation for watching a vid? there are a gazillion videos on YouTube, pls don't ask us for a donation, it looks small.
Noise59	sounds harsh but its true he is right
Jacob Linker	You messed up by asking for donations. For some one teaching others to be multimillionaires why ask for money? That puts negative thoughts to others that are really looking for help. If you're saying you can help people become multimillionaires the you shouldn't have to ask for donations. That's taking money for those who don't really have money to give donations. For those who do have the money to give out donations, don't need your advice. That's discouraging that you would ask that. These videos see more as a con that as help. Good luck bud I hope you enjoy receiving money from people who really could use that extra money. This really makes me feel sick and makes you look like a lowlife. Congratulations. I hope you feel good about yourself by conning other people I just hope others are just as smart as I am. I'm not dumb I'm just looking for some guidance and sure as he'll didn't find it here with someone asking for money. We might as well sit around corner streets begging for money. That's pretty much all you've taught.  
l8on99	This guy is a purely negative jerk. His message/tips are right but very old school and terribly opinionated, when he says wonderful it is even negative. Not a motivational speaker at all, skip to the next video if you came for inspiration. Hahaha, don't forget to donate(I loved that dumbass ploy) to him so he can call more people slugs and $hit on them. I don't care if he is a millionaire, he is an asshole loser that cannot teach.
ghayath2011	I think finding a job is 50% timing and luck, 25% your qualifications, and 25% if the employer likes you during the interview
Awkward Turtle	Its a great video. Thanks   
Sheila Ber	Life is a job indeed! either you quit it or you keep it. To keep it, you  have to be smart, strong, and steadfast. You can do it!

Josh Brunt	Get a job.
Queen of Carrot Flowers	This guy talks so slow. I can't even watch this anymore, get to the point.
Jeremey Allen	I dislike this guy VERY much... But, he is right about a lot of things. But again, I dislike him VERY MUCH.
Vlado Genov	Imagine living the rest of your life with freedom. Pretty awesome right? Well anyone can. Take a look at Split Profit Setup on Google (GOOGLE IT). My partner has has been earning $422 every 5 days using Split Profit Setup. Seriously search for it on Google.

mark swearingen	I know what you mean! I don't know about where you live but in the Inland Northwest we apparently hate college graduates and there are no entry level jobs! Plenty of jobs for the experienced though.
theCVman	Please take a look at theCVman.co.uk CV building and support for Graduates and Professionals!  
minzy421	you can't get work experience yet alone a job
jimmypinch	he's right, that's how i got anywhere, just turn up for work. 
Jake Ruff	Lol, wow....I'm more desperate than I thought. 
TheWildCardA	so ur saying ppl shouldent go to college then and i say working for the military is something to be passionate about i dont think going in there for money is ethical at all just shows ur defending a country run by making urself money not gonna motivate you in the battle field is it  
Scott Campbell	reading from a telapropt  yup  :P
Mehedi Melu	Awesome strategy, its actually quite similar to Monthly Bill Nutshell. Search for it on Google, I make a monthly income with Monthly Bill Nutshell right now & work from the comfort of my home... I never worry about bills anymore haha.

This helped Gary to work from the comfort of home and thus benefit from financial liberty super fast. I hope it helps you as well.
Lucixir	All I can say is that you sir have no grasp of the new working generation. This may have worked in the older generations that did not have to compete with a global economy or greedy, self entitled, forget everyone else minded business model of today. Meritocracy, of which you primarily speak of, does not work like it used to. It is not even considered in today's economy because you are not worth minimum wage compared to other labor markets for pennies on the dollar, with no benefits. Wake up.
saleen49	This is exactly how I got my job! 
Anthony Stark	don't do security forces. :)
samuraineko3	What a boss 
Arnor Davidsson	scam!
reckless brocoli	I'm living in Belgium, My future should be bright! I'm on one of the best high schools in country, but i can't be motivated to work for school... so my grades aren't good, not bad either, but not good ! However, when i'm designing home's, i'ts  a different story! My dad has an architecture company, and is investing in real estate. he says i'm quite talented and i might take the company over when i'm old enough. But how do I work for things, e.g. high school, that don't interest me ?
Om Mehta	REALLY? I very much doubt that works. The only serious system to make money on the internet I've found is using Household Wage Project (search for it on Google). But there's not many copies left...
Matthew Lewis	jobunlocker provides industry contact delays and a system to contact these people to land your dream job
MattFaulknerMusic	'You want the job that you want'. No shit Sherlock.
deltaisf67	Great Video. I Graduated from college with a major in accounting almost 2 years ago. I got a full-time accounting job through one of my business teachers who worked in the company I work for. I was hired within a month of graduating! I can personally attest to the truth of these words!
Zak H	Awesome video. Student tuition is rising and job openings are very competitive. But we need to know that 85% of jobs are not advertised. Its really hard as a grad to find a job in this economy. I personally use BZCareer.com to find a job.
Mark Chatwood	Love the straight-talking attitude! 
Ed Horn	You know, i think you have a lot of good to offer and i appreciate your videos.  I wish i had this available to me when i was younger.  The one thing i would like to add though, is there are a lot of people that have the wrong perception of "work".  I would offer that if they do not know what they want to do, to at least STUDY SUCCESS.study books like think & grow rich & science of getting rich to understand the MINDSET they need to develop..reviews available for free meister60dotwordpressdotcom

squidtubess	Joining the military is a great idea. Military is a great idea Is a great idea A great idea Great idea Idea. 
Jason Ries	This is just silly. Every decent job requires that piece of paper that costs six figures, like an MBA. If networking, nepotism, cronyism and favoritism is what it takes to get a job we would all shop college and go to bars, restaurants, trade meetings etc.
Hoe Phi Van	Do you want a social media job?  socialmediajobs.newrich.co

Frustrated Black Man	sometimes you just gotta do it 
Dillon	What do you say about joining the Armed Forces, I mean you go on about jobs, but what do you think of people who join the Military I haven't seen one video with you even hinting at it. 
John David	These tips help but your best bet is to be your own boss online. IT is the biggest industry right now. There are 20 000 new internet milionaires a year that they don't talk about in the media. It is very simple to advertise. You just need someone to guide you and be your mentor telling you exactly what to do. Go to Proper Income dot com and I will be your mentor.  Sincerely, John David
