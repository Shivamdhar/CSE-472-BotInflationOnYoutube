You one of the first few YouTubers to start out at a time when this whole concept was so new. Now, the YouTube space in the beauty/fashion section is so crowded but what really makes you stand out is that your channel is very “girl next door”. The videos and tutorials are so relatable. Honestly, no college going girl has the time to sit and put tons of makeup or but products from fancy brands. You keep all of this mind. There is such less  sponsored content on this channel. Most of the Beauty YouTubers promote a new skincare / makeup fav every month. There would be atleast 1 Nykaa post on their channel every month. There is just sponsored content on their channel which makes me question whether they actually just use the product for the video and never go back to it. But, I have seen your products remain consistent which definitely shows that you show us what you truly use and believe will work for others. Honesty, above all❤️ \nTo many many more milestones☺️ \nAlso, ever since I have heard you speaking of the estee lauder advanced night serum about 2 years ago, I wanted to buy it but it’s a big hole in the budget of any college going girl like me. It would be so nice to include such a product in my regime since I have just begun with the whole skin care thing. \nLots of love❤️', 'ayushi rajvanshi': 'Hey sherry!!

The Body Shop Lip and Cheek tint (which I bought after this article) and 5. Auriga Flavo C Cream. I still remember running after my parents saying "I watch her videos" and I made them watch your videos. It\'s been like four years and I feel like I\'ve been watching you for decades. I have seen you blossom into a wonderful creator and artist and a great human. You\'ve grown during these times and you were strong enough to stand up for causes that you believe in. I remember watching a video of yours (I think it\'s What\'s in my iPhone?) and I still remember how much relationship goals your wallpaper was. I have continuously been voting for you in all these Vlogging contests. Tbh, I prefer monthly favs video over any other. Thank you for appreciating us using this Giveaway. I\'d prefer Netfix/Makeup & Beauty hamper/Sunglasses/Necklace. Thank you for everything Sherry. My love and gratitude for you is immeasurable. I hope you\'ll hit 10 million soon.

When your video came up, I thought that hmm, wow, 250K, that is a celebration and a giveaway sounds exciting. But SO HUGE! I honestly didn't expect that it is going to be this massive. You asked to choose which of the giveaways we want, and after seeing the products, I'd say give me anything! All these are so amazing.\n\nBUT, my most favourite is the Muji Diffuser. I have been crying for it since time immemorial, and I felt that I need to save up for it. Yesterday, I talked to my sister about getting a diffuser the first thing when I get my own home. I am a sucker for aromatherapy and order candles and other stuff from Amazon here and there. This diffuser is like a miracle gift, Sherry. Really.\nAnd if that's somehow not possible, since it is just one diffuser and chances are less, my next pick is the Estee lauder ANR, again one of the things in my wishlist since forever. I have started to get so much more serious about skin care and I feel this is something that I could really make good use of, and the reviews sound pretty exciting too.\n\nI would have written so much more coz I am so excited!

It's a very interesting hamper. \n4) Opium Sunnies. First of all it's gonna be doubly special because in a way I'll be having a piece of both you and Anaita with me. Both of you inspire me a lot. Also I don't own any pair of sunglasses as I've glasses. But recently, I've started using contact lenses. So I'd love to use the Opium hamper. Their collection is faaaaaab. \nLastly the main reason I want on of these is because it's from you Sherry. You've no idea how special you are to me. I'll write a long letter to you which elaborates this point :P (I know you love long hand written letters). You're such an inspiration and this positive influence in all our lives. Receiving anything from you is very very special to me. It means more than just goodies. That's why I want it.

I always wanted a cute journal and they’re always expensive so I carry a notebook instead. That to-do’s book would be sooooooo useful.
