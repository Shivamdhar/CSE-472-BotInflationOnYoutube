I LOVE BOOKS & 5SOS	The ending.  Nuff said.
BooksUnstitched	I like the song, but it really frustrates me that the director thinks this is an EMPOWERING video? It insinuates that girls/women need a man to come a break them out of their situation and that the girls would've just stayed there had 5SOS not come swooping in to save them. Him saying "the rebellion...originates with the band" just backs my point up! If it were an empowering video, it would feature the women starting their own rebellion and breaking out of the system by themselves! So sorry the boys weren't there to incite the Suffrage. Jesus...

sophie brown	Luke, Ash, Calum and Michael, I want to say a Massive thank you. You are literally the reason why I keep practising my music and writing songs hours and hours everyday without fail. because I keep hoping one day I will Be as big in the music industry as you are right now :) You put smiles on everyone's faces and I hope that you will be put in music history and never to be forgotten as that "boy band" you are so much more than that and I am really proud of you four and how determined you were and now look where you are :)  Thank you ❤️ #DerpingSince2011 - @Sophie_Brrown on twitter 👍
