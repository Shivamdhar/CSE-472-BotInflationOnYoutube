Gibrig Arkanu Gundala	Oct'22th 2018
T Timeler	Lmao James! Messing with lars haha. It really seems he enjoys playing these songs more than he has in a long time. And he has so much fun on stage.. more of a relaxed feel.

Orhun Ates	8:42 wtf
cutesywootsey	So adorable these four men <3
ScorpionXII	Metallica's production crew really juiced up the quality of these videos over the years. I remember in the past you couldn't hear much base, and Lars' kick drums were inaudibe, and Lars' high hats were way too loud, now all those issues are fixed.
zack FURY	That intro was lit
Luke's Channel	I was here

Shallex	8:59

Estigma Peru	The 3:53 Obey was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Duhan Duman	Come to Turkey for god sake
Victor Ortega	Beautiful
DeniedHarbinger	Kirk really should use a V for this song. He normally uses a Les Paul for it, but its tone does not fit with the song itself. IMHO, at least.

Japili Axey	GDAMN
AD GR	How cool is Lars here... That duo with James is really something unique, and really big. So big maybe,that gets the other members aside in the Metallica things and decisions. Lastly,those who underestimate Lars because they don`t dig so much his character,while it doesn`t happen with James,I have to say that James wouldn`t have all these points in our hearts,and respect, without Lars. It`s just the truth, nothing more
Andrew B.	8:42 :D
Hamad Taher	OBEY!
MARIA KARENINA	OMG, I`m SO IN LOVE with this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stunning LIVE!!!
