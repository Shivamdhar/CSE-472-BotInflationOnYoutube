Wan Wall	Is Slashstreet Boys parodying exactly a member of BSB? Im trying to compare between the parody and the original videos but there seems to be portions where it does not tally up. This is what I got so far by following the singing sequences of each member. But there is a mismatch between first and last verse (sang by Brian then AJ) while in the parody it is sang by Jason.   first to sing jason = brian second to sing ghostface = NC third to sing Myers = AJ bridge Hillbilly = Kevin Freddy = Howie when Freddy rudely interrupted Hillibillly lol.

4ZenKuda 420	Freddy❤️💚🖤 GhostFace🖤👻🖤 Best Killers👌🏽 Gotta Love Um.  (They just harder to kill I believe 😎) as Freddy is like a virus that burrows itself into your dreams in your head. You start hearing seeing things, people think u go mental, then no one cares. He eventually learns your fears and uses them against you in your dreams. And sleep is a big thing especially to me so imagine not being able to. Madness. And you have to pull him out to kill him which is extremely hard as they only managed to in the last one but even then he came back bruh😂that’s my guy keeping it strong.  And GhostFace, he can be anyone.. Who can you trust? When your very own friends, best friends family even, could be the ones. Let alone the people you least except. Like people on the inside / cops etc. There will always be someone to take on the roll as Ghostface as all it takes is someone to do something bad to them to seek revenge or just for fun. 😎

Peter Parker	Ah man.... I have posted this one and the other one on my Facebook. Wish the other one, Slashing Bodies, had done the whole song like this one. This really took some talent and thought. Pure gold. If I had ONE critique, the last line to be more close to the original song should have been, "Tell me why-I never wanna end this game". It still fits the time signature. But great work all around. Love the part where Myers pushed the girl off of him by her face. I straight up died.

Jami JoAnne Russell	Let me start off by saying I love the videos. I think they're awesome, they show a lot of creativity, and a lot of talent. That being said, as someone who grew up on old school horror I'd love to see a Battle Of The Horror Bands video if at all possible. Slashstreet Boys VS The Classics. The Phantom Of The Opera (Erik) on vocals & keyboard (even better - on KEYTAR!), Count Dracula on guitar & also vocals, Frankenstein's creature on the drums, the Wolfman on bass, and The Invisible Man on saxophone. With their lady backup vocals - The Bride (Bride Of Frankenstein, of course), Irena Dubrovna Reed (The Cat People), and the various Brides Of Dracula.

Zero1228XX	Honestly, while i love these.  These make me want to see an Nsync Parody Band with Chuckie, Pinhead, The Candy Man, The Creeper, and Jigsaw.  Not because i like Nsync more.

Mostly for the right to the corpse collection.

Ana 21	I think this is very linear... It should have some blood or killing humor scenes. I was expecting  that.   A little bit more of imagination. That 's why people disliked. I mean, I saw this  and I didn't want to see it again. It wasn't funny or interesting. Just a bunch of guys with a mask and some lyrics changes isn't enough. The title is great, the  idea is great but the video itself wasn't good enough.  You didn't develop the great idea you had...

I mean all of us have skin, kinda. Talking about you Jason, oh and don’t forget Freddie.”  -Jason and Freddie: “Hey...uncool.” -Everyone else: “Oh yeah and F^*% THAT IDEA!”  -Ghostface: “Alright, here...fine I think we can all agree on this...” -Everyone else: “Okayyyy..andd?” -Ghostface: “Ready?-OK. SCREAM MAKERS!!! Ha? Ha?”  -Everyone else: “No? No? okay.  NO!!!!”  -Ghostface: “okay..😪” -MIchael Myers: “Okay this is going no where, this taking to much of a strain on the different universes, we’ll meet up in a couple of years and figure out one.

Sorry, but I think the Scream movies took a piss on these classics. And for being just a random person in the movies with ridiculous strength, stamina, speed that's able to outrun,  overpower and dominate every victim (when they obviously wouldn't) is a joke. Element of surprise is one thing but let's get real...  So for that reason Ghost face,  fuck you, you don't get shit. Unless it's one of the others sloppy seconds. And trust me bud, those are gonna be some sloppy seconds cause some of those boys don't leave much behind. 😎😎😎👏👏

That's one reason we have street shootings and mass murder s . Today in Jefferson County in Louisville KY we had a shooting at a Kroger's store , two people shot and killed . Neither were related . Shooter went down the isles shooting , one inside died and one outside . THE S.O.B. was caught , alive . Give him the death penalty , he deserves it . Or fry him . A worthless human being .

I hope you guys do more of these parodies of Backstreet Boys with our favorite killers you guys could really make a killing out of this. Keep up the great work keep up the great comedic art along with the Fantastic singing and you all will have dedicated fans till the end 2. 5 million views already I hope I just keep adding them on with when I share this on my Facebook with my 400 and so friends I know it's not much 400 compared to Millions but this needs to be shared. I Got YouTube Red so I hope you guys don't mind me downloading it and playing it on Loop at work I'm going to have so much fun drowning out my boss's Christmas music with this. They've been playing it since September and I've just been looking for one good Halloween song, or two , to get get backs. On a side note I did feel bad and sorry for Leatherface when he couldn't sing. I thought he was on key let alone I would have liked to continue to hear him singing but again really good punch line with Freddy in the dialogue and I like the fact that you all keep in character with everything it's fucking beautiful and I just wish we had more creative /comedic Minds like this on TV. I wish you all the best of success keep making great videos looking forward to your next project :)

Clownin Around	It's not a dream state. It's something a person can't even imagine because the plain of death has no relevance to the plain of the living except for the crossover of the host itself. Being you or I as an example. We can only imagine what we have seen with out eyes here and now and all the possibilities of here and now. We envision our reality here and now of course but.... When we die its difficult to understand it now. When we die..... We won't need a brain anymore so we won't dream, because dreams are a temporary construct of the mind which is a byproduct of the human brain. When we die we don't need a body anymore. So..... What happens us. Over time the cells that made up us.... Decomposition themselves and reduce and return to the atoms. Then to the raw energy and we are recycled by the universe. Mabey into some matter that will once again be conscious of its own existence. Mabey in some far off place and time. Another universe. Mabey to the place in between universes. But I'll tell you this. It certainly is a strange thing we are all in. This so called.......... life....  Enjoy it while we can I say for..... Like a dream lol.... and like time our existence is fleeting....

Isaac Cacciatore Di Genova	You are fuckin crazy guys lol 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Connor McGrath	Whatever happened to good music? It’s the best to parody, sounds AMAZING in general, and created loving moments for many people! Now we get Justin Bieber and Arianna Grande. Don’t get me wrong, they have amazing talent and excellent voices, it’s just the songs that suck and how they are presented. Everything in the songs nowadays have to be so loud. When there’s emphasis on everything, there’s emphasis on nothing. We need the subtle beats and instruments that don’t stand out, and are just barely there. Like if you agree. And if you don’t, feel free to express why. Just make sure you have a viable opinion other than ‘it’s the best! You don’t know what you’re talking about!’. We need more people like Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Backstreet Boys, etc. BRING EM BACK!!!  P.S. Yes, Justin Bieber DOES have a good voice, and yes he IS talented. It’s only within the last decade that he’s been starting to slip, as is what happens with EVERY OTHER ARTIST IN HISTORY. I honestly don’t know why he started getting so much hate in the first place, but you all need to stop it. Actually LISTEN and ANALYZE what you’re hating, before you start hating it. If everyone actually EDUCATED themselves on the issues at hand instead of FOLLOWING the ‘cool’ group, we would have a lot less hate, a lot more knowledge, and a TON more appreciation for things

"me either" Mmm bachelor number 3#  If our first date went really well, would you wait "3 days" before calling me?  "I wouldn't wait at all, I'd probably come see you right away." 😶 o my ehem Bachelor #1 How long do you usually take to 'go all the way'? "The thought and sight of sex puts me into a murderous rage. Some think it's because I have mother issues, my doctor thinks i'm just pure evil soooo...." 😯 ummm ok bachelor #2 ? Same question? " ditto. Nothing makes me want to kill someone in inordinately complex ways than teens having sex. Except, maybe *everything* else, also.  Bachelor #3 :: " I'm down.
