danielle l0ves j00n	chaeyeon queen as a rapper oml
hanie a.	watched the original one and compared it to this. liked this one better. i kept on repeating yena’s parts and it’s so good tbh. her rap is much more smoother and that growl, oh man. she’s a good rapper, vocalist and dances well too. she’s an all arounder. she can look badass when it needs to be and look really charming and cute the next. love her personality too, such a fun smol baby girl 💗  and not to mention, minjoo’s visual and facial expressions here are so on point, like WOW. THAT GIRL OWNED IT
Kim RahmaBhw	IKLANNYA LA VIE EN ROSE WOYY:"
White :.: Cherry	THE RAPPING ENDS ME!! They really slayed this song! <3
Sarah Grace Lawagan	I think it's amusing that Minjoo once looked at Lee Sian in shock when Sian did this song in PD 48.  She probably didn't think she'd be doing this song, and be the center too! I love my Minjoo.  And I love that Chaeyeon is in this too!  <3

oddiecai	Iconic daratarata /im lovin it/ is so weak on here.
hery James	Dont know why people still wondering "Why ppl talking about CheaYeon much?". Maybe just maybe they didn't watch pd48 so they dont know how hardship CheaYoen did. n She just got 12th place, almost out of IZONE. And ppl wondering "Why ppl like Original version much?". just Bc yall dont know "How wonderful Chowon's voice is!!!". or Maybe yall didnt watch the original version yet.( P/s: Chowon is VOCALIST)  btw, Bias CheaYeon and Chowon. So don't wonder why I'm talking like that.
itpanya	I prefer the original one ... this version is not so powerful ..

baby girl	I have been wrecked by my own bias chaeyeon also why I see redvelvet in this song tbh you all slayed.
fat b	i was really confused about my sexuality but eunbi's existence really made me realise that im 100% bisexual
Yeri’s Squirtle	0:55 She is pretty good.What is her name?🖤
Kim zeinab in	💖👏
Gabbie Chu	Yena's growl yall better snksakak
Nabilah Ajid	2m
soph	2:11 is chaewons part why won’t cameraman focus on her 😭😭
Jeon -ah	I really like IZONE but I feel that their voices don't suit the song, unlike the original group, especially in the rap part Don't hate me but i miss them: c Chowon is my Queen FV
Ador kable	tbh Chaeyeon is the only one who looks like she embodies the energy of this song. Had I not watched the show I would have thought she was the only original member of this song
r osmeilia	Belum move on dari sian tapi minju cantik juga kok
andy loves everyone	so much autotune
dont let me get in IZONE	This team works really well together. I am seeing a subunit in the future. Also yena rly stole the show here. I am so glad they have her rapping, she is phenomenal.
Gab Padilla	PD 48 Version is better ❤️ just saying
Muhammad Rifky	Do u know what the first song at the opening?

sasha yang	저는 권은비가 재일 좋아요
seonjang	I'M SO GAY FOR THIS GROUP JDJJDJSJDJS
Gerlie Floresca	Minju looks like Jennie
Elijah Barongan	But like I think this subgroup is what the real producers behind the scenes wanted to create. This group is just pure talent, with Eunbi on vocals, Yena on rap, and Chaeyeon on dance. Can't even think about what would happen to Izone if any of these three didn't get in.
Đỗ Phương	0:03 music? please T^T
Kpop and Cpop Snatch my wig	both groups that performed this song are OUTSTANDING . No need to compare . They both slayed 💖
Alif Yaasin	Lee Chae Yeon 😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jocelyn Ting King Yuan	LOL in my opinion, this version is way better than the original. And Chaeyeon looks soooooo good in this. ❤
Nawi XXI	I think the chubby girl that looks like a cross between Irene and Joy of Red Velvet is going to be my favorite. Not bias but the one i'm look out for the most. I downloaded the original vir.(I think) of this song weeks ago and I've been listening to it a lot and even though, obviously, not all the singers and rappers(especially) are the ones in the original Produce 48 vir.(I don't follow the show) I still liked this second vir. as much as the first. can't wait to see more from the girls.
sun is flower	The original is more better, powerful, and has mire impact. Still liked this one tho
a flibbertigibbet	this performance is great and all...... but the original performance w/ han chowon + lee sian is THE BOMB OKAY
adhitya prakoso	Sorry Yena, Cho Won's rap still better
Vien Phan	I am missing Han Cho Won.

Alexandra Diaz	Bruh the choreo and vocals 🔥🔥🔥🔥
陳姵晴	Chayeon ‘s rap cool!
nadine 's	they sound so good, but i don't think their voices suit this song..
Ana	ミンジュもチェヨンも好きだけど、Rumerは、やはりシアン、チョウォン、サエ、ウォンビ、シヒョンが好きだなー！
S.T walker	0:07 what the songs title？
Blackpink Is the revelation	Tbh this is better than the original  Stop saying the original are better for good sake.
Tanyatorn Wasookoonsirirax	I think one member is too cute more than sexy .this song need to sexy inner. It's make performance down.... I love original ver. more than this ver.
Crazy Unitato	No matter how good this is...original is the best..any cover can be 20 times better ...BUT original is original...u can't fight on that
ちさと	広告がIZ*ONEのMVで飛ばせなかった😂
Flower Sundae	I prefer OG Rumor but the girls still did amazing! I never really knew Chaewon could be like that! I knew she was a good vocalist and that she'd fit the cute concept but look at her go! I also absolutely adore Yena's raspy voice.

Eui Woo Eui Woo	Sorry but minju just doesn't suit this, I was kinda excited when I saw her as the center but the way she portrayed it will just never meet up to Shihyun & Sian's standards, CHAEYEON SLAYED THOUGH
四ノ宮優芽	SAE😢😢😢💓💓💓
yook saranghae	They're good but the original is waaaay better. Also i kinda don't like the rapping here it feels like yena is just shouting. And their facial expression doesn't suit the song unlike the original their facial expressions was on point.

Vo Que Chi	Yena baby TvT
B.P. from Turkey	chaeyeon why are you so good with every thing?  dance vocal and now rap,  but even with her original version is so much better

soonhoon shall rise	La Vie En Rose just played as an ad–
Daeyrell Walsh	Can't wait to see Hwang Minhyun and Kwon Eunbi's interactions😂Leader and Leader😆
Deborah Cheng	I'm so glad that they put Chaeyeon in this song. She doesn't fit any of the innocent visual songs not only because of her looks, but because of her dancing style. She's a great dancer, but I never liked her in most of the other songs because she dances as if she's seducing someone in a nightclub, which did not fit those concepts. But with Rumor, it's a perfect fit.  I miss Sae and Chowon though. I'm still sad that she wasn't the final member. :(

kog wam	なにか理由があるのだろうけど、シルバーアクセとストッキングも同じ衣装が良かった…
I am May	I like this version, too! But I have highly expected it to be more mature than cute like this. I meant I like their freshness too. Well yeah, I still miss the original version as their powerful performance vocal and rap, rather than lipsync like this, Eun Bi and the rest were rocking the stage. This one, mhmm, just need some more power and mature.
Kim Aleah Angkad	So strong
waeVy	Minju has improved a lot with her stage presence but idk I still feel like she's lacking just a tiny bit like she's missing something .. Idk how to explain it but it's a lot better from when she first started 👏

NB	not as impactful as the original team, ive gotta admit
Riham Ramadan	I love both versions but I should say the raps line here are better they weren't worried like produce 48 that some parts were shaking because of the nature of the competition but I still hope the former 4 members the best I hoped they were the finalists especially sian and sihyun but it didn't happen so I hope all of them the best future all of them were amazing 💕💕💕💕💕

Joshua Asuncion	i didn't know Irene changed groups
torix rose	I love all of the, but personally I think that most of their voices didn’t fit the song and they weren’t as powerful as the original! Now I’m not hating that’s just my opinion they are all beautiful and talented I just wasn’t feeling this!
Grace Biss	YENAAAAA OMG
三河真由美	イェナのラップがやばい、、、

CHAWANNA FERN	KIM MINJOO💕💕💕 #IZ*ONE
Moshi Moshi.	Esta..."Versión" JAMÁS va a superar a la versión PRODUCE...JAMÁS DE TODOS LOS JAMACES.  1-La que tiene el mismo papel de Chowon no la da:) 2-Solo Eunbi tiene talento en ese grupo...Fin del comunicado.
Ko Hein	i glad they didnt add those 6 songs to their album ... because i believe there are ppl like me out there who cant get out from past version ... like this i felt this is not powerful like the previous line up ..
Katrina Arcos	I like this version more
Pedro Alres	I love Chowon's rap in the song but I always want to hear Yena's rap since her scene with Eunbi in pd48, and now she indeed slay 🔥🔥🔥

Aynahs	Yena rap kill me. Chaewon too . I love all them hahaha

Raito키라	in love with 2:10
prdyxk	แซ่บมากๆข่าาาา เยนานุ้งกร๊าวใจมาด
Shang Mae	Stop comparing chowon to yena because they both have their unique rapping styles and this is yena's first time being a rapper so don't expect too much
Kpopper	This can't beat the original cover of Rumor. I like the rap of Chowon better because I don't hear any cuteness in her voice and I like Sian's 'neon toxic' better. And I like Sae's 'oh na na na' better. Nonetheless, this group is still amazing. Yena's rap is good but i still hear a lil cuteness there.
dasomarie 0921	Chaewon is so ugly skl
UN FAMOUS	No offense but I like the original ones from the produce 48 idk. 😭🙃 i like them but i just can’t feel the “VIBES” that i felt from produce 48 perf. Hehe just sayin’

Linh Khánh	0:01 song?

BEE	Chaeyeon did so good with both her singing and rap parts and Minju fit this concept surprisingly well she was really good and I will always love her voice! All of them did amazing but those two stood out to me!
SoshialButterfly	Omg I love this. Yena's soft tone shocked me but this is exactly what I wanted from the song.

Yeonaah Beasley	Ok but Chaewon is smiling too much for me to think of this seriously 😂
ruarua ohoehoe	Missing the original members as well judging from the intensity of the intro oudtdone by SiAn herself. How I wish she was on top 12.
Suga's Go Away Mat outside his Genuus Lab	Is it just me that Eunbi kinda looks like Irene at 1:40 - 1:41. Anyways if it's not in your opinion just shut up.

GoldenKookie 97	For once I'd like to see a girl group like this wearing pants. I don't mean that in a slut shaming way, I think they're beautiful but girl groups constantly wearing short skirts/shorts is starting to get extremely basic for girl groups? When Yuri from snsd wore a suit in a dance practice it actually gave her "sexy aura" more of an effect
School Of Hope	HELP US REACH 1M VIEW PLEASE! @

Lady Sushi The Chiba	OMG WHO IS THAT GIRL AT 1:52 HER VOICE SLAYED ME. In all honesty though I love how her voice was soft yet deep and sultry which was a nice contrast to the rest of the groups very sharp and high-pitched vocals when that girl started singing I was instantly captured by the depth and almost husky voice. All in all a very beautiful contrast.

メロンパン	チェヨン 万能❤️
Anh Le	1:20 I cannot take my eyes off Chaewon. She wasn't the boldest in produce101 but I see she gradually made herself seen and secure her place firmly. Tactful, graceful, very delicate but also strong and persistent.

pon pon	チェヨンちゃん ラップもできるなんて知らなかった！ ダンスも歌もラップもできるとか万能すぎるわ。てかめっちゃ脚綺麗(°▽°) イェナちゃん ラップめっちゃ良い！ あんなに可愛い声でこんな力強いラップがてきるとか半端ないって。すごいしっくりきた。 ミンジュちゃん ダンス上手くなってる！ びっくりするほどセンターがハマってた。セクシーってイメージは無かったけど、この路線はアリだわ。 ウンビちゃん Rumorのメインボーカルはやっぱりウンビちゃんだね。曲のイメージにバッチリ合ってる。安定したボーカルはやっぱり良いわ。 チェウォンちゃん 妖精さんのイメージがだいぶ定着してるけど、キレキレのダンスを見ると、 やっぱりダンス上手いなって思う。 まとめるとIZ*ONE最高ですね！
Mourly Ariena	im cryin

tricia kim	Chaeyeon reminds me of seulgi, Eunbi as irene and Minju as Jennie! LOVE THEM😍
Kaz	While everyone's comparing the original PD48 version with the IZ*ONE version, I'm just here being so happy that there are two versions so I can enjoy seeing more PD48 contestants singing this awesome song, hearing different variations of the rap, as well the feel of the song through each of the groups' presentation. ^_^   Two things that we learn from this: (1) Rumor is awesome, so are the members that did that first. (2) IZ*ONE shows that they can be flexible in any concept, and are multi-talented and that they really deserve winning the PD48 survival show and as a member of IZ*ONE, no matter who our preferences/trainee biases are or no matter how talented the other trainees are as well.   I know the other trainees are great but we have IZ*ONE now. Let's just hope for the best for this new group as well as the trainees that didn't get in. Let's move on and enjoy what we have now.
glydel	*minju's image and aura here fits the song very well!!!*
Gracie C.	The original one is definitely better especially the hair flip of the first girl in the first version always gives the whole vibe of the song.

Zhang	Finally I am waiting for this coz I able to see Chaeyeon's powerful dance. But I missed Chowon. She deserved to be in this group 😭 😭 she can rap, dance and reach high notes, I was so sad when she and Chaeyeon were fighting for the 12th place☹️ Seeing Minju danced rumor, she improved a lot. I wanted to see Hyewon improvements too, she debuted in IZ*ONE lacking too much when there were other girls deserved her place. 😤 😩
Klitchi Kyliee	If IZ*ONE have a plan on something like sub unit.  Please use this line up, they have it all from rap, dance, vocal and visual. Bless this performance

Sorry for the stupid questions but I really don't know much about produce 48 and these girls and I'll be so happy if someone is kind enough to expain it to me 😊 Thanks ❤
J. Doan	they changed the distribution parts right? Minju was supposed to hit the high note after Eunbi's?

Babyz SaiKizTV	Who can tell me? Have thing chaeyeon can't do? Go go unni!!@
Aryane Dwi Putri	Interesting line for a sub-unit And honestly though, what can't Yena and Chaeyeon do? Same goes with Chaewon, too bad I barely saw her, where's Kim Chaewon mnet 😑 Minju is getting better compare to her pd48 era And Rumor is really Eunbi's song, and your straight black hair is not good for my health
Naufal Echa	man minju
evae	If y'all really hate this version so much, just don't watch it. It's as simple as that
fatin kimkai	Lee chaeyeon BITCHES

Mochammad Tegar	This good. But I prefer Rumor from Produce48.  NO SAE NO PARTY 😭😭😭😭
Hung Lê	chaeyeon dance sing rap so good 😍😍 fighting
SVTmademydaySVT 17	Chaewon's vocals are AMAZING! Most of the comments are about Chaeyeon, but i'm here to support my favs CHAEWON and EUNBI! They slayed their parts. And Chaewon was actually rapping at 2:11 but the cameraman focused on Chaeyeon instead. Poor little girl T_T.. if you want proof you should see the live lyrics in the video. During 2:11, it showed Chaewon's name! And the dance practice it was her part too. Loved the highnote that Eunbi made. Yena killed the rap part and the way she rapped it was so cute that it made my heart melt.. Minju rocks for being the center!!  FIGHTING IZ*ONE!! ♥️♥️ Also watch closely, this is an Eunbi fancam of Rumor, watch Chaewon's mouth during the rap part, and Chaeyeon is half- rapping   cause she knows that is not her part:https://youtu.be/UGj8DEGDF2M  Justice For ANGEL CHAEWON!
Lam	Eunbi <3
yena tomi	YENAAAAA
shesvi	Am I the only who prefers Yena's rap? Lol

Anisya Ramadhanti	Yena and Chaeyeon are rapping. They slay the stage 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mermaid	Even it’s minju it’s good center, isn’t better thay Sian like center or Goyujin like center. Just saying.
Dtarchon	MinJu's visuals are superb. What can I say. Wow.
hui yee	POWERFUL
Juanny Fel	They all showed different kinds of fierceness here. Eunbi is someone  that is fierce at the same time elegant. Yena is fierce then her smirks makes her playful in a good way. Chaeyeon shows power and fierceness in her movements. Chaewon and Minju is innocent-looking but there is fierceness in them that draws you in.  These are just my observations tho.
Nadine Gaspar	this song is so addicting
なちごろ	セクシーすぎる😮😮😍😍
fran higurashi	COS'È STO SCHIFOOOOOOO

ゆずきy	これすごく好きです！！！！
Kris	Prefeer The original
Nataša	Sorry Yena, but Chowon is rap queen of this song. More powerful.

Lai-Kwon Jazz Marie	Minjoo really improved a lot! And Yena and Chaeyeon nailed it love this version of Rumor!
토끼tokki	K hay bằng team produce

Shy Mercado	Finally RumorxChaeyeon 😍😍😍
blackpinkismylifeyass xD	Dance:100/100 But in terms of fierceness it hasn't realpy met my targettt uwuz
Cẩm Thi Nguyễn	There’s something about this sub unit... lack of swag, I think... most of them look cute more than the swag needed for this concept.
Leah Sanchez	YENA JUST "WOW" EUNBI😚
HowCome Seriously	I'm glad Eunbi is here The only original member
Iniaz Anilama	cheayon good at everything❤️❤️
I LOVE LEE CHAEYEON!! And I LOVE KPOP AND ML!!!	OMG I LOVE THERE VERSION!!!😍😍😍😍😍 CHAEYEON!!!

Jas Min	I like this song and the girls are good performers (lacked power tho) but that rap.. rlly ruined the song for me, it was so bad omg is this from produce 48?
Aldous Kim	Minju is cute but she just doesn't have the charisma Sian posses to start the song with the iconic "toxic" line.
Eliza Schulton	yena i know you have a great voice, good rap as well.. but this song dont really suit you
ariadne blair	YENA'S GROWL.
Keyowo MJ	My Lee Chaeyeon can sing, rap, and dance!! 🔥 Im stanning this amazing girl right here. She deserves the recognition she's gaining. Shine Chaeyeon!! 😊 Congrats on your debut!

Slayer Ch	Eun Bi is Queen 👑
Janelle Gorospe	They all did great but i was shook with chaeyeon and minju's part.😂 I didn't know she could rap and minju can be "dark" compared  to her 1000% image. 😂
aldi sergei	Sorry, u cant beat the real H.I.N.P even there is EunBi as same position.  EunBi, u better in H.I.N.P than here.  Yena, U CANT BEAT CHOWON. MinJu, U CANT BEAT SIHYEON & SIAN.  Chayeon? Idk, i'm dont understand what she doin here.
appado gwenchana	YENA SLAYEDDDDDDDD

yuuna rii	parah si yg disiniii🔥🔥🔥
Rico Miguel TV	I'm suprised. The ad is the MV of La vie en Rose by IZ*ONE😍😊😅
blade 482	this makes me sad
IG CARINGAL	Sian, Yujin, Chaeyeon, Chowon, Eunbi should cover this... It's not as powerful as before even if Eunbi is here
Khaali18 Kawaii	No es lo mismo pero es HERMOSO
Meyli Amante de los coreanos	Yo no entiendo a los que no les gusta esta versión, a mi me encanto, y Ye Na para el rap es legendaria en esta canción, en cambio la rapera que hacía la versión original, se escuchaba muy forzada, yo entiendo que bailando se desentona la voz, pero para mi Ye Na lo hizo más agradable de escuchar, es solo mi humilde opinión, y espero la respeten :3.
Jel bb	Minjoo is killing us with her visuals😭💕
_nvymx	Ehh, Sian + Sihyun were a better combo imo. But Chaewon's vocals fit the song so well, I was shocked!
ナヨンペン	black pink感がすごい
Axa Uribe	Yena don't know how to do lipsync
ragita widya	Five of them are all-rounded girl, They slay everything also Minju really suit well with this concept  STAN IZO*NE

Irma De Los Angeles Fenandez	:( no is original
q j	민주야ㅠ 너무 이쁘다ㅠ 분위기 루머랑 찰떡ㅠㅜ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
zainati soliha	Yena rap and sing!!! Slayy!!
Marry - MiNiE	Full respect to eunbi! Even without her og group, she killed it! She shined in this stage. Of course she looked a bit tired, maybe she misses her og. 😔 I love you eunbi! I miss you chowon and sian❤️😢
Eka Oktaviani	CHAEYEON😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
iKON's Foreign friend	MINJU SNAPPED!!!! 😭😍💕
icefairy junhoe	Surprisingly, Minju suited the concept. She had better facial expression than the rest cause I don’t think a song about a love plagued by rumors would make you all smiley. She’s improving in dance too so I hope she continues to do so to get more screen time
S E R E N D I P I T Y	Who misses Chowon ?😂😭
Deyb Deyb	The dance is definitely better than original. (Maybe because the singing wasn't live). But Chaewon deffo danced great but her smiling like a cutey girl isn't working for me. Sae's impression from the original was way better cuz she a cutey but a lil bit flirty. And it totally fits the song!  Then, Yena's rap is good. But I think its a lil bit gimmicky for me. Over-all this performance slayed me nevertheless. But original was better for me. ;)
I LOVE BTS	quick question  how many of the original members are actually in this?
Kristhian Valdez MHYS	Chaeyeon and yena rap skills are so damn  good and perfect i love it Fighting <3
N. Hana	Someone looks like irene here

Jalali Danica	My Queen is always slaying on the stage  #lee chaeyeon fighting saranghae
Aiki	no one can beat the original group but I'm glad Chaeyeon and Chaewon have finally the chance to cover Rumor. they did well here too.
Kim Doobong	No one can replace Chowon's rap lines. The original is more powerful :<
Adriana Olivares	Creo que es realmente buena esta versión, pero no como la original ☹️
Jose Warren	murasae sae
Ruby Rose	Awww i mis Sae already 😭😭😭
Haru Kaze	Its good but I’m sorry the iconic “sarangeun da ra ta ta ta” line is best sung by Shihyun. Also the dance is better here and more powerful
EXCUSE ME	Ugh 💔 SIAN miss you but leader EunBi and Minju and Chaeyeon as well 🔥
itsb2uty1016	Their sound was too soft for this song. But Chaeyeon slayed the dance. I want to see her more tho
Once in a Blue Moon	Don't hate me but... I'm honestly not a fan of Yena's way of rapping in this 😅
debie kwon	CAN WE TALK ABT HOW CHAEYEON TWERK AT THE FRONT OF THE CAMERA? DUDE. DATS MY F*^@&^!&&! HELLA BIASS !!! 😍😍😍
Cheska	Chaeyeeeoooon! She can sing and now she even raaaap kyaaaah

Emilreen Ebuen	YAS MY MINJU SLAY SIHYUN'S PART 💜 but miss the original :(
Amalina Rozan	Wow guys can you just appreciate the effort and hard work than comparing? Why expect it to be the same obviously its not? They cant be like the original because they arent. Ppl can be complicated.
RachalwithanA	holy shit yena can r a p
ikram	nah this ain’t it
marina permatasari	I like original version but i like this version too it perfect and fit for all member
Alpukleon	KA EUN
Gianne Simbajon	This concept ❤️❤️❤️

Lynntendo	Never would have imagined Yena would be such a great rapper! Also fairy Chaewon being sexy!!
Miru Chi	I got the La Vie En Rose MV as an ad before I watch this LMAO ㅋㅋㅋ
June	Lol at Chaewon at 0:37
Eline van Dam	this honestly feels like children singing an adult women's song... the girls in the original looked mature and were way more fitting for the concept.
Layla billet	OMFG THIS HAS NOTHING TO  DO WITH THE VIDEO BUT DOESN’T YENA LOOK LIKE HOSHI FROM SEVENTEEN!!   I always knew she looked like someone but couldn’t pin point it out

Blair Bubbles	YENAAA!!!!! 😍😍😍
potaatoo	i just remembered the ep where eunbi asked yoo jin and yena's advice in her rapping, back then yena was imitating eunbi's rap and making fun of her hahahahahaha then now look at her gentle growl xd
Dkuhyo	I think that chaewon,minju and eunbi suits more the concept then chaeyeon and yena. But let me say, the yena's rap is awesome
JETTA 007	いや〜ホント震える。チェヨンはスゴいなぁ。ミンジュもホントに上手になったね😍😍😍💖💖💖
Army of Radishes	I'm so glad Chaeyeon got to perform the song she wanted back in Produce 48, she even cried when she was kicked out because she had to do a cutesy song.
Steroids Freak	These the same girls with the asian makup transformation right?
joy amadea	After the 'toxic' part i kept waiting for the reactions 😂
Maxpower Yee	Produce 48 ver. is better than izone ver.
Hannah Kim	Wow.. The performance is so satisfying. Totally love it. The rap vocals dance. Perfect 👍
Khris Martinez	CHAEYEON CAN SING, DANCE AND NOW RAP??!  WHAT CAN'T YOU DO GIRL?  😍 (AND NOT JUST 'CAN' SHE EXCELS ON ALL)

Denzel Suazo	Minjoo's deep voice sounds so sexy. 😱😍💕

Little Star	Chaeyeon is the Golden gem of Izone. My Queen ❤️❤️❤️❤️
lily perez	Who is the idiotic cameraman that purposely zoomed away from Chaeyeon in the body roll part
BlastOf Kpop	Despite the power and sexiness from the original not being as prominent, you can’t deny their vocals and rap is so much better. Can you?
God Ҡìωì	pd 48 ver. better than them
vanou08	This has more polished rapping.. and Yena made it perfect.. but the original has more attitude and way fiercer.. Chaewon Yena and Eunbi are perfect for this song..
Diana Kitaark	OMGG IM SO OVERWHELMEDDDDD!  this performance is good! i mean minjoo did exceptionally good and chaeyeon damn girllll and eunbi flawless as ever so is yena and her rap and ofc and damnnnn chaewon could slay this concept really well
하영리	still love the pd48's version😕chaewon's waist is so thin tho😍and they're all so pretty
maisrh hns	*MINJOO HAS A SAE VIBE*
Hobi Hobi	the original was better 😭😭  but omg i love yena’s rapping voice though
YUI I	*can’t replace the original one*
MI Mi	Eunbi looks sad here making me to love her more...I guess Eunbi performing this thinking about her team...Only Eunbi debuted from Rumor team😭💔💔💔 Iz*One are all good, but no one can rap as powerul as Chowon did. And the original center was so iconic for this song. And the five girls of original Rumor team are really the queens!!! They were sexy, powerful and shined on stage!!!
Lingling Xxi	Ohhhhh yenaa 👍🏻👏🏻

Avvah Ruiz	I believe it can be as good as the original one if my girls perform it live and add more energy to their performance besides Eunbi was still there to help them to improve this performance like the original one.
Rachel GS	Yeeeees Minju
Solar yong	miss sihyun chowon :(
Jermaine Lee	😭😭😭
Diem Minh Nguyen	I'm sorry, Eunbi, Chaeyeon, to say that I addicted the original performance. "Neukkim" I need this. Miss Rumor team so much...
Lina lina	This was kinda fucked up
Multi-fandom Enthusiast	I loved Chaeyeon during 1000% but this concept fits her soooo much
Wilma Telesio	채연 ❤❤❤
maebebae	I like that chaeyeon included in here cus her voice suits the rap part, chaewon n minju's voice sounds so gewd, yena's so unique, and eunbi slay as always but still i dont get the vibes
Kwaija McFarlane	I'm sorry but...it's just not the same. Which makes sense, only 1 person from the actual group is here
Rubymaster P	Minju ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Guava Jo	Well.... this formation maybe won't be same with the original version. But, you can appreciate that Eunbi still slay with her vocal, Yena with her rap (that growl tho), Chaewon' visual, Chaeyon's multitalent (she can sing, rap and dance mostly) and Minjoo's improvement ❤
azxingmee studio 3	chaeyeon definition of complete package!
제니정	Chaeyeon should be the center
Just ARMY	Chaeyeon is killing me. We saw how much greate at the vocal and at dance in Produce 48. But when she made rap and ı can't breath. She is good at everything. She is miracle. 💜❤️💙😍
wn lleeana	CAN WE TALK ABT HOW POWERFUL YENA'S RAP😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥

Certified Once	chowon, sae, shihyun and sian did it better.
fe	petition to make this as a subunit
AHGA- FLU	chayeon and yena are vocalists but their Rap is really good... like wtf do you want haters... IZ*ONE already debuted and if you don’t support or hate them why do you come here and waist your “precius” time on them

nette hardy	yena did great!!!!!sometimes i think yena look like taeyeon
lena samsudin	yena rap 👍
Nadzmi Zulkiffli	Love the previous
Bernadette Astorga	no hate. but i want to express opinions. i really love the original. huhuhu. already missing sae. but, i'm trying my hard to accept the fact that this is the reality and nothing can change the fact that girls performing it now they won. but i'm seriously missing SAEPPI so much. but don't judge me, i also love izone chu
nandanrlhd's	Yena haa a unique rap
Qiong Wan	It's not easy to control your hair.
Edesonism	2:38 Chaeyeon didn't get in the absolute center position of the stage, the rest of the girls smoothly follow the new alignment. PROFESSIONALS.
Ngọc Bảo Châu Phạm	What is the song from 0:01 to 0:07?
Clara Herrera	I loved the original performance and I kept watching that for days but I love this one too. In my opinion, I think this performance is more balanced than the original though.
Paweena Smanoareeruk	yena sogood
Anisa Fitri	I prefer original ver. I miss chowon :(
Vkook Lovers	Chaeyeon really suit this kind of song😍
Eyds101	2:18 okay that expression is on pOInt but the voice during that just isn’t it for me and eunbi’s energy is a bit lacking idk i just feel like during this perf she was holding back,,, anyways stay slaying laid ease
yanshuang	Ahhh chaeyeon ❤️
甘い派卵焼きは	Rumor was the best member of prodigce forty eight, but this is a new one😭🙏🏻

RoseClerigo Do	Choi Yena the cutest and softest rapper 😍
Hyunjin slay them with your visual	EUNBI X SIAN 😢❤
Tiana Nyemlim	I love their performance. But I miss Sihyun so much *cries*
J. Maccari	yena did an amazing job
Grandier Delacour	Im in love with this version, both the original and izone version has their own thing, performance wise i must give it to the original group because they slay the stage, but sounds wise, this izone version really sounds better.. they are tired plus Yena is not used to rapping, it's normal if they looked less powerful than the original one performance.. No need to debate about which one better, both are equally good, at least for me... btw i really really missed YiRen 😣
kim shimie	I MISS SIAN THOOOO
Mikatanachi	holy f Chaeyeon and Minju i cannot
丸菜	I’m shocked for having Minju in this performance but not in 1000%😂. The original one is better, both for the image the and voice. I guess it’s because for the original members they all really fit into the concept of rumor, but for izone members it’s hard to found 5 members who are really fit into the concept for Rumor. Like for Yena she’s good for sexy but her sexy is more like a “cute+sexy” (the concept for 1AM) and Minju is of course cute and pure. So it’s normal that the original one is better than izone ver. but izone still do good.
Alyssa Jean Ramos	its definitely different than the original but its still good :) btw when people are saying that chowons rap is like shouting..i think yena shouts also in the same part but its recorded so the quality is not as loud or rough as the live of chowon, also that part needs it to intensify the energy of the song :)
Bình Lê Thị Thanh	This performance has no accent or appeal. I prefer the version in Produce48 more. Miss you Sian, Chowon, Shihyun, Sae 😢😢
ねぎモアイ	さえぴーを思い出す…
Nur_ InfLyz	Good job my sweetie IZ*ONE Love Chaewon and Eunbi
Biscuit & Rebisco	feels bad about minju and chaewon. they look weak and should be replaced by other members like sakura, won young or yu-jin
Rinnie _rena	Woaahh😍😍yena n chaeyeon so great here
Elyz	Chaewoon is still my baby
Chloe Chik	It feels like they are performing a SWEET rumor but not a HOT AND TOXIC rumor. It’s so disappointing although eunbi is here.
Angie Fiorella	Me encanta ptmre me.mueroo❤❤💕💕❤❤ Kwon Eun Bi 🙌🙌👌👌👌🙌🙌
nisnisa 0515	Yena omg😍
nt cong	Nhìn Chaeyeon thôi. Rap, dance và hát tất cả đều tốt. I love u.
unn Wknown	chae yeons really talented!! she can even rap . wooooow 😍😍😍
My Name Is Safa	CHOWONIEEE 😭😭😭
BeautyCin2	The rapping part is ok for me but I think they still can improve their facial expression. For my opinion, this song should be more feminine style but most of the members here are more cheerful type and innocence look.
Pat Man	people can never be contented. let's just appreciate their talent (for the performers of both versions)
Бегайым Бекказиева	Minjoo 💖💕💖💕
elif Taşdemir	3:25 OMG 😰 LOVE U GIRLS
나연Nayeon	Im chaeyeon's fan but i really love yena when she rap
Jenesis Tan	2:17 omgggggg that look!! <3
JrNuest my bae	I am imagining chowon, chaeyon, eunbi and sae...slaying this performance. And then having minju as the center..my life is complete
isowon	OMG~ the girls are too cute! Except for Eunbi and Chaeyeon this feels flat~
amalia nursalamah	Is that live?
Vitoria Dias	Chaeyeon me matando segue tudo normal
elafantul4499	Guys keep in mind they were way more tired here. The original rumor team had to perform only rumor while these girls were having a concert. They performed a few songs before so it's obvious it's not gonna be as energetic as it would have been if they had only done rumor. Even eunbi was a bit tired. And also if i see anyone say cHoWoN dId It BeTtEr i will riot. During pd48 ppl kept complaining that chowon only shouted during the rap part. Now that yena made it a bit softer y'all have to compare just for the sake of it.
Nicole Kim	When I heard the song, its just like KARD's You In Me😂✌️
Kate Park	I badly miss Chowon😭
hui	even tho I was in love with the original version, this is not bad at all. yena and chaeyeon gave this a different vibe.
Lam Nguyễn	Yena ak!!!!! Cj giết ng ak😭😍
Putri Sausan	Minjoo grows
Ma. Roqueza Joy Mateo	i dont know. but i think they look so tired. i mean look at their expressions...

Onelle Zielle	CHOI YENA LEE CHAEYEON KWON EUNBI IS QUADRUPLE THREAT..   -RAPPING -DANCING -HIGH NOTE -VISUAL THEY ARE REALLY NO JOKE...
Red Velvet WJSN	minjoo should've tried to do what sian did to make her expression more fierce( like those kinda nose scrunch(dont know the spelling😂)
siew yu peh	omg La Vie En Rose just came out as an advertisement
Kpop Dose	I got an advertisment from stone music before this and it was love la vie en rose.   Guess no skipping ad this time
Thuna_wb	Is Yena wearing Chowon's clothes and Chaeyeon wearing Sian's?
TWICEx ONCE	Let's talk about how Chaeyeon's visual killed us. DAMN She looks good and cool in this look af. 😍😍

doms salvador	just got into i*zone today and i literally got like 4 biases now but wow chaewon’s killing it why is nobody talking about her? she dances so well too and has great vocals, why not talk about her too!!
Rulita Ramadani	Only me missing go yujin :')
wiil ibe	best song in the season
wu kris	They are good but not perfect as  “real rumor team”
Devonn Rayos	People here doesn't really know the difference between a concert and a competition. They would say that the iz*one girls lack fierceness. Well, they don't. You are just tryin to compare the competition level to the now-we're-just-performing level. For me, they did their parts very well.
Ivan Joshua Fuentesfina	Chaeyeon is perfect for this song. i love it!
Rian Barani	they're good but the original team perform rumor perfectly, and sian is too iconic for this song😂 but i love them💕
Jenny Chu	Chaeyeon!!
Lisa I want your Jisoo so bad	Yena as the main rapper is on another level

Impersv Art	minjoo - SERIOUSLY GIRLs??? i like her in opening expression,her bodyroll so cool! chaewon - chaewon dance are so clear and i like to watching her dancing chayeon - SeXInesS eunbi - slay as always, but i like her in original vers. but here,she looks so beautifull with that hairstyle yena - my bby.I NEVER EXCEPT her for rapping, i like her husky voice while rapping

kai soo	え、ミンジュやばいって めっちゃこの曲に合ってる💕💕
わり	イェナのラップ控えめに言って最高💜チョウォンのラップも大好きだけど、イェナのはまた違った良さがある✨✨
SnowClover	Trying to cover this is like trying to cover Never from produce 101, they can't be bettered because they are too iconic for the series. The originals will always be no.1 but they honestly did an amazing job considering what they had to be compared to. I'm still disappointed that we never got to see Go Yujin perform as centre as she would have been incredible. It's sad because I reckon that performance would have made her popularity explode.   I do wonder, if this was the original performance and the original was the cover if we'd be saying the same thing because they both were fantastic, it's just different.
hwang galyang	ofcourse the original will always win but what y’all mean, this is rly good!!! loving chaeyeon’s and yena’s rap! chaewon sounds good too!
Anonymous Jh	I miss chowon 😥
riean cuares	LOVING YENA!!!!!!
Surreal Score	Mnet really does have some of the shittiest camera work. They completely miss the best parts of the choreography. Would it kill them to shoot the whole group @ 3:27?? Literally NO ONE CAME HERE TO SEE THE STAGE OR AUDIENCE... Just keep the gd camera on the performance ffs
peachy niels	omaygaddd chaeyeon and yena did the rap parts sooo well i did not expect this 🔥 great job girls!!!!
Aisyah 101	Chaeyeon is so talented😍 she can sing high note,she can rap and she can dance very well😍
Mari Aby	I need Chaeyeon's fancam on this!!!!!
Eka Syafda Reta	"maybe" because the concept of this group feels cute, so they are asked to always smile even in girl crush themes. This is just my opinion, please respect 🙃🙃
Bishika	minju was at bottom 2 but now she just rose the ranks to be like my 3rd fave
Leaholea	The confidence of all the members is the best part!! I deeply miss the old group but who would have guessed Minju and Chaewon would conquer this
man hin leung	tbh... not hating but its not as good as the original version... especially rap
lisa ROXXI sandoval	❤💖💙💚💛🧡💜🖤  *IZ*ONE IS BETTER THAN BTS!* 🖤💜🧡💛💚💙💖❤

like _aiman	better use this for their debut...its better right?
Angeles Maria Noa Quispe	The other version I liked most
Rem San	I came here after watching the original, i am a hugr fan of izone but i hate to admit that the original was way more better.... Sian, chowon, sae, eunbi and shi yun are the perfect team for rumor they fit the concept so much from their looks, charisma, and stage presence, but they're dancing were a little bit lacking, but the vocals and the rap are so fckin lit!! The blending of eunbi's power vocals and chowons powerful rap, sian's perfect voice and charisma, sae's visuals and shi yun's perfect center.... IZONE did a great job too i was amazed of chena's and chaeyeon's rapping skills but i liked the more powerful version, in this version eunbi was not as powerful as before :(( minju did a good job as the center her voice was so good at the opening, but her charisma and presence were lacking, chaewon was amazing too but i just think that she doesn't fit this concept... the dance in this version was more good but in overall the original was way more better and its irreplaceable for me😍💯 missing chowon, sian, sae and shi yun😭 I AM JUST SHARING MY FEELS AND OPINION NO HATE!  #Izone
Rositah Najarin	Chaeyon😍😍😍😍
Arin William	Missing kim sihyun so much..forever the center of rumor team..

cookies oreo	Yena rapp its so good but i still missing cho won😭 but still love this💕
Zen Sabio	Eunbi is LOVE like she's always been. Yena's rap is also LOVE. Chaewon's voice is LOVE but her expression lacked something. Chaeyeon is SUPERRRRR LOVE!!  But Minju's TOXIC isn't as TOXIC as Sian's TOXIC.
Valiga Salsabilla	Yenaaaaa top 1000 top top
Alia François	I loved the version in pd48, and i also love this version, especially yena and chaeyeon's rap 😍😆

Alien Boy	I stan LEGENDS
슬 민강	Eunbi looks alike irene rv or am i wrong?
nct cult	*No hate but the original will always be more superior and probably the most iconic stage performance from the PRODUCE48.*
Maryam  Seboa	I have always liked chowon's rap and for me unfortunately yena didn't do it for me she  was like trying her best to sound like           chowon and she failed for me , no hate just prefer the original they were way more powerful than them , do u guys remember that part where chowon shouted her rap and then Eunbi sang louder that for me back then was the most powerful part of the song and you know I just didn't feel it here man. I miss rumor team so muuch:(

_Lee . Felix_	Literally no one is talking about chaewon my bby slayed her vocals, her dance skills, and her visuals blessed. 😔✊💖
Sielle Franco	Sian's intro is iconic. But I prefer Yena's rapping tbh. For the choreo, I still prefer how Yujin does the choreo. I love Chaeyeon but the way she dance the rumor choreo esp in the chorus is a no for me.
Nova Karlina Siregar	Chaeyeon♡♡
Aragorn Lee	Yea can y'all like shut up with the *tHE oriGiNAl waS BetTeR* cause like no one cares and you should show support instead of bashing. Y'all voted for these people so deal with it.

Siang Lin	Minjoo baby you're doing well <3
is2seungri	i love yena but also i love chowon. i think chowon style really perfect for Rumor, like no one p48 member can change chowon image in this song. yena image is too girly for this song. but... i still love both of them :(( don't bash all my girls please
Phuong Nguyen	*NEW RAPPER LEE CHAEYEON LMAO*
swiftie Khunnie	MY YENA IS SHINNING
Ninja Nigga	this is an example how people always comparing something with the Original.  ofc they cant rap like Chowon, cant twerk like Sian, cant walk like Sihyun bcoz they are not the same. they doing their own version and its not that they wanna "replace the original" Chowon rap is powerful but i like Yena rap with her own style. its a matter on "how you see them"

こ	I hear Sakura shouting "Chaeyeon!!! " lol
Mel	would have preferred if they sang live though 😕
Shela Azahar	The vibe was different compared to the challenge. But chaeyeon and yena did great as rapping. Yena improved a lot and chaeyeon is definitely rising and getting the recognition she deserves!
PinkDaySOSHI	The original center and the original girl who sang the first part 'toxic~~" still did waaaaaay better and gave much impact.
fujima4kenji	l watched the dance practice and been expecting the stage! Of course we all love the original. The original is irreplaceable! This ver has it's pros and cons. The original is more powerful, charismatic and mysterious. This ver is a bit girly. Minju: didn't expect she'd be the center. l thought it would be Chaeyeon Chaewon: her voice is a bit higher and she can't flirt, but her dance is on point Chaeyeon: need any word??? Yena: her voice is a bit high in a few parts, but Yena has fierceness in her rap. Of course, but she is a better rapper than Eunbi. LOL

Naye Joon	DOESNT FEEL THE SAME WITHOUT CHOWON
KPotato V	I miss the OG lineup for Rumor :’) ......
Nezha	seeing all this minju praise warms my heart, ive supported her since day 1 seeing everyone call her just a pretty face and ultimately end up hating on her when she got a spot. but if you really watch pd over again you'd see shes been working hella hard, she knew she was behind everyone else and was getting by with her pretty face so she had to work twice as hard to show how much shes improved.
Nee-Chan Studio	I noticed that Eunbi was feeling down here...i guess she just miss the OG member especially sian😭 Btw I prefer the original. Who's with meee?  Ps: WATTT😂 23 likes?😂 too much for me eh HAHAHAHAHA

나나나나나나나나나	은비 원샷 진짜 많이 잡아주네,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tudungss Murah	Chowon better rap
Diy Af	This performance is good but I think for the dance not stronger as original performance
Kaimalie Nonaka	Damn can’t some of you be happy for once or at least congratulate and tell the girls they did a good job performing rather than being petty and bringing these girls down saying “pd48 was better”, “Chowon was so much better”(not trying to make Chowon look bad or anything, I love her too) “original is 10000x better” “this performance sucked”. We get it, you guys miss the original group and the original will always be iconic and loved but can some of you seriously just stop discouraging these girls who’ve been working hard to improve and to make people happy? Also Chowon and everyone else who was part of the original team wouldn’t be happy to hear their fans talking so negatively about their friends and trainees they spent working together with (ye consider me annoying but these girls don’t deserve some of your guys disrespect)
Mạch Lúa	Chaeyeon did the best, btw, i like the stage by Sihyun more
Random fans	When all of the most talented in the group slay the stage!
izone feather	Chaeyeon is incredible, even those hair flips looks so classy. Hi filo wiz*one, whose with me?
CL Park	Yena's rap. 0.0 it has so much soul in it. I seriously got goosebumps. Way to go tiger!!! 🐯
Johnsy Gonzales	Chaeyeon and Eunbi amazing 😍
hxlographic	i miss go yujin, no hate though! they did good
Aslim Dessy	LEE CHAEYEON IS IS ILLEGAL.
rani dewi	This is really awesome!!!! But honestly i really miss Si An :(
Maxpein Zin	Did Minju, Chaeyeon and Yena use the same clothes with SiHyun, Sian and Sae from the original rumor stage from pd48?
TheFidyaaa	Did Yena never try other hairstyle?!?!?
gita astari	I don't know why, but isn't this song image is 'girl crush in a bad romance complicated situation'?  If it is then, why do the girls smile & give cute gesture a lot?   I don't say its bad, but it gives the wrong vibe for the song. Girls, I know you are happy for finaly get to perform on stage, but come on. Only Minjoo that keep her face expressions fit the song most of the time.  The others always smiling when their part to sing came, even the original member Eunbi.
junah Beltran	Pak Minju!!!!! Everytime Minju sings her part the Crowd goes crazy. And Dang Chaeyeon's part is just awesome but I really wish though they have a member that has a same Singing tone or style as Sae's and it makes me miss The Rumor team Sian, Sihyun, Sae and my precious Chowon...
1D Harttt	2:09 YENA KILLED ME.
Arren Hidalgo	Eunbi looks tired or it is just me that her eyes didn't sparkle that much in this performance?

Pipah Epa	I still prefer the one before. I really don't like eunbi voice/singing. I miss cho won. She deserved to debut. But too bad cause she did not have the chance to prove it at last performance cause eunbi is too greedy to take the position of vocalist. I don't like eunbi.
Kwon Eunbi & Tzuyu love4ever	Kwon Eunbi❤

ALICECOVER_ 21	Am I the only one who want to cry??
nikko salomon	fuck the cameraman. When Chaewon was in the center in the last chorus where was the camera? In the center part where Minju was supposed to be focused it went to Yena and eunbi. UGH smh
Hường Vũ	Chaeyeon 😍😍😍
Hotaru	woah i got an ad of La vie en rose

Urielle Miranda	The rap is great and they're all talented but the stage felt off 😶
Charilyn Caraat	Wow minju.....😀
MerryMe	Kim Minjoo is Kim Minjoo and Sihyun is Sihyun, just because Minjoo didn't do exactly the same, doesn't mean she did it worse. Yall are just salty because your bias didn't make it, admit it, oh and my original bias was Kaeun and I'm not one of those people who keep on saying stuff like "bring back Kaeun" and I especially hate when k-netizens say that, because they're probably mostly people who didn't give a cent to vote. So stop comparing, Everyone in here did great, oh but of course you don't bash Eunbi because she was part of the original group, how lucky of her, I can't wait to see what people say when the other performances come out and say stuff like "it's not the same without her and her" it's annoying, stop, you have no right to judge someone. Oh and stop saying "no hate but....." because you are clearly writing that with the intention of downgrading someone. Oh and nobody said that you had to stan IZONE. Just leave with all of your unnecessary comments and we'll ALL be happy, stop wasting your time dearies.  *EDIT*: And yes, I am triggered, who wouldn't be, seeing all this negativity is gross. I hope yall who are salty about your bias not making it to the lineup go ahead and go cheer for them, and stop trying to bash the ones that made it just because you think that "they don't deserve it". Just please stop.
pipin	love Chaeyeon rap

Merong Me	It's my first time having an MV as an ad...the MV of La Vie en Rose is the ad of this video when I watched this
Rhon Rallos	i think for me this the real cute and sexy concept  and i love Chaeyeon and yena exchanging rap part but then camera man failed to focus some Chaeyeon's rap part cuz i find it cute and intense ,,but any way good job iz*one 👍👍

LOONA STAN GG STAN	Icoooon
ONCE KIDS GOT 7 MY DAY Will be ful	I still haven't found my Izone bias yet Im picking between Eunbi,Minju,Wonyoung,Yujin, and Sakura..... Eunbi.....she is so talented and so pretty that makes me want her as my bias but.... Minju comes and take me away from Eunbi and she makes me love her and want her as my bias but... Wonyoung the big center maknae that always looks pretty and has a cute voice which makes me love her...but... Yujin's charisma and visual captures me the most but..... Sakura came all the way from izone to my bias choosing just because of her visual and because of her short hair in La Vie En Rose But i guess i will be supporting Izone without a bias,i will support each member cause i love them all
Musyarrafah Jamil	i feel bad for si hyun
Fzhra Athim	Seulgi? Irene?
Trixie x	I liked, but the first version was better! But they rocked it anyway
maftukhatu sholikhah	Huhuu luvv❤️❤️
Can someone buy me bleach plz?	Sian’s opening still remains iconic but Yena and Chaeyeon slayed too
Hidayah Ibrahim	I miss Sian voice here. The original is better of course but Minjoo really did best here
pureheart3	This performance made me miss chowon's rap, sihyun's walk, sian's opening verse and sae's soft cute voice.
It's Me Jorge	It's really a good idea for Chaeyeon to debut.. We can see her Rap, Dance, Sing.. Damn her VISUAL 🔥🔥

carmslopez	*_Chowon is getting love in the comments and she isn't performing😂_*  Anyways these girls did amazing! *I was shook with Minju's part!*
PRISTIN SAMUEL WANNA ONE HIgh Ganet Wannable	honestly i love this music than the original (pd48ver) but I like the feeling of the original than iz*one, i feel like there's something missing in this performance.
엘이	STAN KIM MIN JOO
Aileen Sadia	I think this will be pretty good if they sing it live because of the rap
Meo Min	I miss Cho Won 😔😔😔
Liyan Black	(In my opinion) other than Yena's voice being too light (less deep?) for the rap, I liked it
yunik	am i the only one who prefers this? i mean i love the original also but this– someone hand me the oxygen tank pls thnx
ang kids	OMG CHAEYEON AND YENA RAPPING? I LOVE THIS💗
small eyes	แชยอนนนนนนนนนสวยมาก

jaempholic	KIM MINJU YOU GROW ALOT. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!! IF YOU READ THIS, PLEASE KNOW I WILL ALWAYS LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU. KIM MINJU FIGHTING!!!
yanuar krisdianto	Damn... Oh noo,minjuuu... Too beauty and pure for this song... Just my opinion😁😁 But this still badass, appreciate to yena... Yena always go with great performances and improvisations..👏👏👏
Landon Baby	Unpopular opinion but I didn't like chowon's rap in the original one at all and I prefer this a lot better. I feel like chowon was 1. Too aggressive but also at times she wasn't clear at all and I couldn't hear what she was saying. Yena and chaeyeon did a much better job rapping here
Alliezza Morta	MINJUUUU
Andi achmad	We have to admit that the MVP is Chaeyeon, and she's not even in the original group..  And for Eunbi, still i prefer her Live Vocal
Chiaw Kher Ai 1210	Omg Yena’s growl at 2:09 is soooo good 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
Britney Meyer	It just feels wrong because I’m used to the other version
Melanie Araoz	I honestly didnt expect to like this version very much but YENA KILLED HER RAPPING WOW LEGEND
Produce 48 Caguioa	Beacuse i love chaeyeon yena minju eunbi me too i miss cho won
MiSO is my religion	No... Please don't do it again only the original is good. This smells pure autotune
오늘도 고생 많았어 다들 수고 많았어	I am bitter Yuri didn't get to perform Rumor when she wanted to do Rumor since the concept evaluation.
riptide kth	KWON EUNBI!!!!!  💖💖💖💖💖
Hminga Tetea	Seriously what are people still complaining 1) Of coarse the original is always better , and I luv the original too. 2) When chowon rap everyone complain saying she's just shouting then Yena make it softer and people said again chowon was better . 3) Minju surely slay that center part , so stop bashing her . 4) For people saying there's no power , of coarse a competition will have more power this is just a cover(maybe) now . They did their best but a competitor's mind is always strong .   I seriously luv Yena rap , she can control her voice and her voice fit it too that's it.
Hwayi Cat 15	Chaeyeon the best 💖💗💖💗💖
sharifa hamid	Aside from chaeyeon’s dancing and eunbi’s performance, i find everything about this song  cringeworthy.  Im sorry but this aint a cute song. Wtf is all that facial expression coming from.  Waaah. Pls stick to the cute concept instead. I would love to support them but pls stop with the experimentation because that train has already been gone. Let them stick to what most of them do best, be cute.
Pichayaization	Can’t stop looking at HER!!!  CHAEYEON❤️
Kaelyn Papa	EVERYONE SLAYED THIS PERFORMANCE OH MY GAWWSSHH
iz sm	Will there be a day when Lisa and Chaeyeon will dance together?they are the only ones I know who can follow the dance after watching it once...that would have been so amazing.
callme oiz	Yena rap 🔥🔥🔥
dove s.	frkn camera man, he wont show chaeyon's part in the chorus....
Mariana Cruces	Chaeyeon  you are full of talented
heru	dude literally no one cares that you prefer pd48 stage, no hate to the girls i rlly love them, but just shut up this is izone ver
Ari Dewi	Mantulll
Precious Coralde	Chaeyeon and Yena's rap. ❤❤❤
ignatius alexson	choi yenaa omg
Feed Me Some Pizza	I miss Cho Won because of this song. 😭
kass	EUNBIIII
TaemyYong	Yena KILLED THAT GROWL 🤣🤣🤣
Riza Ruiz	They did well but now u probably all know that Chowon did a great job with her rap before. 😌 No hate tho since I love Yena and my baby Chaeyeon but let's admit it, Chowon really did a great job before, I mean her voice, the way she raps, her aura really fits the song and so is Sian. 😭😭 My rumor team in my heart will always be Eunbi, Sian, Chowon, Yujin and Chaeyeon. 💞
Unravel	Since nobody wants to talk about Eunbi, I guess I will. This song is just brings out the best in Eunbi!
rurulala	I can't choose which version is better. Chaewon, Chaeyeon, Minju, and Yena certainly brought a new flavour to the song. I think a sultry song like this fits Minju more. Also while Chowon's rap is more powerful than Yena's, Yena's growl really sold it to me lol.
Sakura Matsui	Lmao great job but for me Go Yujin's version remains superior forever😭💕
PRISTEEN	all these comments. NO ONE'S trying to be better.
Shien Syaf	They must be so tired so bcs of tht i think they lack of energy & fyi, this is not a sexy song entirely . So its normal to smile on the stage .
あうぇい	イェナ…推しになりそう…
i go to skool boii	I hope they would debut this sub unit and make a concept simila to rumor
DarkShadow5356	Is it me or do they not seem invested in the performance. Maybe Eunbi misses the original members, she seems sad.
HAECHAN'S NATURAL TANNED SKIN blessed us	EUNBI MINJOOO
chris r	Not to hate or anything but this can't compare to the original. They made it too cute this time, you can see even Eunbi adjusted to her new members and tried to look cuter. But back in the original Rumor, there was no cuteness. Whenever they smiled, it'd only be wicked, sultry smiles. They were literally ssenunnies. The rap might be better in this version but the original still wins my Rumor supremacist heart.
Hani Phantomhive	Hmmm performance wise and vocal wise i liked the first performance (by pd48) more, Sian's voice suited the song soo well and they performed with more energy but rap wise? i think yena and chaeyeon just sNAPPED, their voice suited the rap part so so sooooo well.
Yan suyandii	ini bagus , tapi lebih suka chowon dan kawan2.
no daniel no life	!!!!
Florence Richard	Crying when watching this.. Miss original member of Rumour team.. Miss Sian, Sihyun & Chowon.. They have vibe n really nail it back then.. 😭😭

Zpike	why is anabelle smiling in the whole song?  chaeyon couldve done better if it wasnt that they have to walk foward.. minjoo why so serious? yena focuses too much on looking at the camera.. eunbi i miss ur brown hair.

Nisfina Harani	Idk why just lee sian, go yujin, kim sihyun, han chowon, and lee chaeyeon suits with this concept. Izone ver so good, but i don't feel anything. Fighting!!!
Jordan Che	OKAYYYYY MISS MINJU
はむchan	ミンジュえろい
The Bathtub Jimin is always in	are they really pushing yena as a rapper now? She's a vocal in the first place, now she can rap well. An all rounder!

Sherwin Gimena	not being rude to this beautiful girls but i miss Sian's iconic Toxic intro, Sae's sexy dance and cute "Love is blind Now i'm blond" voice, Shiyun's Da ra ta ta ta, Chowon's Shouting rap.  But my Queen Eun Bi still slaying here 💗

Reka Berliany	Minjoo
Ellaine España	I remeber eunbi practicing the rap parts and Yena help her to rap. And now look at yena. She rap the same part at PD48
Tetz 08	Why is that the focus of the camera is not divided well to all of them it’s either eunbi or yena that we can only see? Can you not be bias mnet! Don’t get me wrong, i love them all but let’s be fair

taetae ilu	Yena and Chaewon slay it my daughters!
stacy sering	Min Joo’s seductive voice
hansi	MINJU DID THAT !!!!!
Harold Tolentino	I miss the old performance of rumor
싴탱	The original obviously left a huge impact since it even went up on charts, however we have to accept that this new lineup will keep on performing this if they have to. They won the contest, the others did not. It is just fair to say that they deserve to perform this on stage again, in front of so much more people. Both performances are still so good tho, you may state your opinions in the comments section but do not bash and compare negatively. Remember, they are the original and final members now. Whether you loved the produce48 version more than this, sorry but that's probably the last time you'll see them perform that. There's no need to bash these girls now.
Zuki	I liked it, but I prefer the original performance, sorry :(  i miss team rumor </3
bulgogi	the beginning sounds like Major Lazer and DJ Snake "lean on" ?
Sekolah Alternative Temba Saleko	Cho won
Moni Huata	I miss CHowon tanlent  voice!! <3

koKO242	low brow performance Chaeyeon and OG Eunbi were the only good ones
Sophie Diona	For my opinion the produce 48 rumor team is the best, they have so much energy at their dancing is really impressive
Afrilia im	I miss chowon.
Chaengi Chingu	EXCUSE ME KIM MINJU :")
elishaoran RHN	Girls, you performed this song well! even though in pd48 most of them got another song concept but they can perform this concept well! You did a great job and I Love You 💕
Yeseo Lee	Am I the only one who can imagine Sian saying, "MINJU'S SO PRETTY!!!"
Jennifer Francesca	i still love the way sian say toxic:(
emily lloyd	they did tHAT
abdiel jaimes	Nice try but not even close
Krizia Bardinas	Chowon's rap is still the best. Miss her 🙁
peky	i came to the comment section hoping to see people complimenting yena and her amazing performance and instead this is full of people saying that "cHoWOn dID It BeTteR!!1!" guys i miss chowon too but i find it kinda rude that you keep comparing her to yena, when the only thing they did is rap the same part. yena doesn't have to rap like chowon, that is the beautiful thing about music. everyone has their own style. if yena tried to copy how chowon sounded it would be weird. this is her style and it's amazing. yena is a multitalented girl who can sing, dance, and now showed everyone that she can also rap!!
Michelle Vera	I miss Sian and Sihyun so much😭💔 but Yena, chaeyon and Chaewon definitly killed me and took me to the heaven, that was SO AMAAAAZING 💜💚😍😍😍😍
Nam Wan	Lipsync? no offense pls
Fearless Ngia	In my opinion Eunbi and Yena seem to only fit this concept. The others look more cute or girl crush. Not to say these girls were bad but to me Eunbi and Yena were the only ones to really match the cool sexy concept.
Rara Anggraeni	Kim Sihyun, Lee Sian.. Yep.. I love the original one
nida khofia	I think yena's rap better than chowon ... i got goosebumps  Don't fight me
Mary Bellh	Yena 😍😍😍

Andi Nurwiany Ulfah	Chaeyeon😍
Najlaa Abdulaziz	I really like the original ver , but Yena did pretty good job 😍 she tottalt suit's the whole concept
Danae Chu	YENA’s Charisma is no joke srsly.
Mhay Kwon	I love IZ*ONE, but honestly the previous performance is on another level. H.I.N.P slayed that performance. Everything is on point, vocal, rap, dance, visual and stage presence. Anyways, I'm happy that they debuted already.
kalecumber	I DONT KNOW I NEED THIS UNTIL THE DANCE PRACTICE GOT RELEASED
Carpe Diem	Han Chowon😭😭😭😭😭😭
Margaux Gadiane	😆
Syeril Akshareari	Lee chaeyeon. Pretty, Can dance, can sing, can rap, have good sense of humor. Perfect idol! 😂😂😂😂
maria dominique	gonna stick with chowon's rap.
Meri Maria	Yena's rap is so hot 🔥🔥🔥 wow
fikafika isn	Oh my god...  Their visual are awesome.....
coolgirl312	People keep saying they miss Chowon’s rap and how [insert current rapper] isn’t as good gahhh this is like Jr’s rap in Never and people complaining the final groups version isn’t as good. Whelp the concept evaluation performance is still available on YouTube to watch and the original song is still available to listen to/download/purchase/stream so go listen to that one and ignore this version. The competition is over, Chowon (as amazing as she is) unfortunately didn’t make it in, there’s noting we can do at this point. Putting down other girls who worked just as hard to get to this stage isn’t going to bring her back.
M	ウンビますますアイリンに似てきたね
Yu yummy	最高すぎーー😍😍😍😍😍💓

S Adillaa	Ini the end chaeyeon get this song as her song
aoi sid*mochiduki	本家って言っちゃいかんけど　シアンちゃんとかがいた方のRumorの方が完成度高くて生き生きしてた感じするなぁ　でもこれはこれでイェナちゃんのラップがいい感じに光ってる気もするしなぁ　個人的に前の方が良かったかな。。
Mac T	Love Yena and Chaeyeon, but Rumor is Chowon, Sian, Sae, Eunbi and Sihyeon.
dontmindme	I love this team what a unit -- Choi Yena!! She did so well!!
Chy A	Tsk tsk after all that Live singing in Produce 48 and now Lipsync🙄

🍗	Can someone tell me the members plzzzz and thank you
Cha Aki	The difference between the original and this version.
chaeyeonie	no hate but minju didn't have sihyun's powerful stage presence and yena's rap sounded like she was trying too hard to sound like the original
JaMeah Jackson	These five did great and chaeyeon I will support you girl!!!
Hamuning	めちゃ努力したんだろうな〜〜イェナのラップ鳥肌
Uwuwz 121	YENAAAAAAAAA!!!!!😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Philip Kwok	Everyone talking about Chowon but hello guys, Si An? Si An was one of the most powerful parts of this group and the other girls couldn't even bring out half of the power she brought out with the concept. I love Chaeyeon but Si An was queen.
Gulacha Gulsaksiri	Can't take my eyes out of Yena!!!! She rocks this concept 💕
thu nguyễn	Choi Yena

bangtan army	Did chaeyeon rap?
LIZTROUS 2000	🙋can we have a chaeyeon fancam here?
Kitsune Sama	All the people saying that the original version was better seem to have forgotten that "Rumor" never reached its full potential because Go Yujin wasn't part of it. Literally everyone on the show said so, it's not just my opinion. So before you bash this version keep in mind that you're pining for a pale shadow of what this song could have been.
hsyje kim	Dang yena's growl in her rap!! Werk it gurl
NK k0829	イェナのラップ！ プデュの時にもイェナがやったらいんじゃね？くらい美味かったし、練習？の動画でてからずっと待ってたよー！

Araceli Jeon	Sorry, but i don't like this team 😐

fudanshi akut	YENA SLAYED ME SO HARD
sulljk	Eunbi looks tired:^(
정Yunjeong	It is unfair. cause Japan members have too many fans cause they debuted at least 7~8 years ago. Look here.Everybody are J-pop fan and they are talking about only Japan members. It is tooo unfair to Korea members. Maybe it make they feel bad too.   I hope mnet never do this again. Everbody who join the program should not debut before.

Adam Kovic's Manscaper	I swear to God, you can put Chaeyeon in any of the 5 concepts and she'd pull it off easily.   I miss Chowon but YAS YENA

Luz Apaza	*OMG LEE CHAEYEON* 💕
Malak Khaled	I love Yena so much but she didn’t suit the rap at all. She sounded too soft tbh
ruu Li	チェヨン、ウンビが圧倒的すぎる
nurulain94	princess chaewon doing girl crush concept...what the all rounded princess

Robbie Hernandez	MINJUUUUUU!!
florencia henriquez	SEND CHOWON :((
I Stan	I was taken completely by surprise when yena rapped, i was expecting chowon’s voice and she sounded so different. It’s kinda weird tho bc i loved her rap in la vie en rose but i think her style didn’t fit this song at all, it sounded more breathy (? Idm how to describe it but i dont mean that in a bad way) and lacked the power needed for the song
Rastri Dewi	This team slayed so much. . . Good job girls
gaurikiya	I'm not gonna lie sometimes I see Irene in this stage and not Eunbi
Jasmine790 jas	Eunbi like irene
xinjing wu	I personally think eunbi looks kinda tired this time. I don't know if she is a little bit sick or not feeling well... she normally is way more powerful than this. Minju is just pretty and quiet as she always is but she is soooooo beautiful in that lip color... Others are just as excellent as they always are:)
Yeon ‘	I SCREAMED
Syun Bi슌비	90% of comments are still salty. Comparing this to the original version makes you stupid. Like ****.  Yena is different to Chowon Minju is different to Sian This GROUP is different to that GROUP  Can you please just appreciate it?   And if you're still salty about the final line up, who cares?  They are debuted now If you come here just to compare izone to others step back. You must stick to your favorite trainees and wish them to debut. Not to attack other groups.
Twice For life	Yena rap is the best!!!! I love the original one but with yena rap.. I'm not hating on chaewon(?) but yena is much more better rapper than her.
IM IN LOVE WITH JYPNATION	ok guys, you said that chowon's part in rumor is too loud and annoying then yena did it softer you said chowon's better than her😔
もか。	2:10 adult Yena(; ;)
ncten forpresident	yall dont gotta lie to yourselves, yall know no one will ever be able to beat the original rumor team LMAOOOO i love iz*one tho

Micaela Flores	Damn Eunbi looks so tired. Did they really need to use the same clothes as the original performance? Lol
m.b	Chaeyeon fan ⚘
miltha riski	i love chaeyeon
수아	I honestly don’t want to hate but Minjoo is trying too much. >.< I want her to just be natural and it seems practiced. But she did improve and I’m proud of her. But the part that got me shook was when she sang Shihyung’s part “사랑이 da ra ta ta ta” she sounded like her (a bit)
Denisse Le	I love i*zone but I like the original version better, Chowon's deep rap fits this concept better and the higher pitch rap just kind of throws off the whole song
Shiro Kuro	they should learn to lipsync better. it was so so so bad. their lips didmt even match the backing track half the time
Soy Un Perdedor	CHOI YENA OMG
eza muhammad	none can replace the PD48 version. sorry.
Anii Yñiguez	CHAEYEON

Kim Roa	OMG did I just get a goodebumps??
jendeuk	i miss old rumor team but good in this group
Jonathan Tirado Cataldo	Me encanta 💕
Anime rocks your world	I did a thorough analysis on this entire video pls give me recognition 0:15 rip Goeun  0:27 Minju as center?? sign me tf up  0:34 T O X I C 0:35 they all snapped -- ok can I just say that I don't think Eunbi matches this song (I think she's more suited to I AM) because she smiles a lot like Chaewon during Rumor and has that cute voice... also like Chaweon -- which is saying that I don't think Chaewon matches this song either 0:53 she screamed so hard I'm sorry but that's not rapping that's like a cry for help Yena let's calm down 1:00 - 1:02 every frame of Chaeyeon is flawless I dare you to argue with me 1:11 focus on Chaeyeon's bouncy hair thank me later 1:13 we love a serious queen 1:37 i just noticed yena stole chowon's bedazzled top lmao 1:38 Eunbi's vocals are so powerful i can't-- 1:42 her voice just sounds so happy i'm sorry it just does not go with the song 1:45 Sakura: why he touchin my man 1:47 gay intensifies 1:52 I wanted to see Minju's face at that moment cameraman why you have to be like this 2:01 Chaeyeon is a rapping queen 2:05 Yena's second rap is so much better it sounds great i love her so much  2:09 HER VOICE STRAIN ARE YOU THERE GOD 2:17 when someone asks for a bite of my food 2:39 Minju's voice is better than a lot of the member's voices wow  -- also Minju looks so sad on this stage  2:40 I wish my squad looked as fresh as that 2:48 Chaewon did that 2:56 the high note you came for -- also is it just me or are they excessively pointing fingers at the camera 3:16 Chaewon snapped once again 3:17 Chaeyeon's hair all over the place reminds me of that time when she was freestyling to Instruction and the beat dropped 3:25 wig 3:28 shaken -- the audience isn't hyped enough -- MYP: Chaeyeon (she fits every genre, every song, so well, it's impossible to dislike her or think she's not talented)
Skyler 99	Yena did great as a rapper but it feels a bit cringy to watch her act fierce and sexy I think she’s better off with a cutesy concept
bluexSae	Am I the only one who preferes this version more than the one in Produce 48 ? I'm probably the only one 😂 I mean I love Chowon and I really supported her a lot in the competition, but I was a bit disappointed  with her rap in Rumor, and I think Yena and Chaeyeon did a really good job, like they weren't shouting but they were still powerful. It's true that Chaewon lacks fierceness, but the others were really good. I thought Minju would look too innocent to be in the center, but for me she actually did a really good job ! It's true that I was used to the original version but I really like this one too. They did a great job.
Choi RaeHun	STOP TO COMPARE THIS IS IZ*ONE NOW AND WE LOVE IZ*ONE. IF YOU PREFER THE GROUP OF PRODUCE 48, GO TO SEE IT BUT STOP TO COMPARE, PLEASE.
Sam Sunwoo	Who would believe if this was the FIRST official debut stage??? They look so seasoned and professional!
Sulyeon	I am so impressed by Minju, she is working hard for sure
Putri Faiqotul	Chaeyon Chaeyon Chaeyon.. She can do everything.. the best in Rap, Sing, and Dance.. Joha joha joha Chaeyooniiii..
Fluffy Jimin	Chaeyeon and Yena did a great job with the rapping! I just feel like some members were lacking the powerful stage presence required to perform this song ... Good job!
おいしいしめさば	イェナのラップ好き❤️
MinKimlove	I miss ChoWon queen😞😞😞
Raditya Rakkay	Yena & Chaeyon Rap is better than Chowon & Shi Hyun
I EH	I really really really mis Chowon but I think this stage was also good. I think we shouldn't compare them with the other performances.
juli cool	IZONE SLAY RUMORRR!!!!!GOOD JOB GIRLS
ashullu	YENAS RAP!!!
gaby	YENA’S GROWL DURING HER RAP MAYHAPS IM GAY
Kookies And cream	no hate to IZ*ONE but the original Rumor team did better, this just lacks in something in my opinion. Anyone else agree?
Savannah Baker	Legends

Rendy Hakim	I’m loving this version❤️❤️❤️
SAYURRO	Chaeyeon ❤❤❤
Wan Lee	Omo minjoo,...!!!😍😍
Yanira Ayala	I don't like this version only Eunbi is good but the others girls aren't good also the rap line of original version is so powerfull and the center is awesome but this version is boring
Mix101 _	I miss chowon and sian :'
Vik Toria	I guess Minju is the center because she is the only one who understands that this song is not the cute, smily type. Even though she doesn't dance good here. But most girls don't get it. Also...they had so much time, why everything looks so messy.
Sin Full	The original is better. I'm not hating...its just hard to adjust. Ive listened to the OG rumour on spotify hundreds of times. This stage looks okay but sounds weird. I don't know...I really miss Sian :(
Okashi Nara	CHAEYEON SLAYED!!! <3 <3 <3
thomas hendrik	Cheo yeon, yena, chae won, Eun Bi, as my expected, you're doing good. Minjuuu.. you surprised me.. lol 😄 as a center. Like your expression 😍

Julia Koshbaevna	Ok, this is not THAT powerful as original performance
Pudin uwu	AAAAAAA ME ENCANTAN😍
YATOGAMI	Love Kim Minju’s vibe in this video. It’s like “I don’t care bitch” 😂😂😂
teresia ren	CHAEYEON’S SCREEN TIME??????

woojin's smile	YENA OWNED THIS
Vinia Elviany	Love Yenaa 😍😍 the good rapper 😎

Paola Terrazas García	i need to CHOWON and SIAN in this song;
1Deborah8	NOW I MISS SI ANNNNNNNNNNNNN T-T GIRL WHERE U ATTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Cute and Dorky 2pm	OMG DID YOU GUYS HEAR YENA!!!😱😱😱😱 i still dont think she really match these type of concepts but her talent overthrow everything!
teen er rykende varm	YENA'S RAP OMG
Heh	0:04 OMGG that's Hiichan's friend we saw at IZONE CHU.
Waroot J	The original 5 sounds better...
옹 최고	Remarkable chaeyeon rap!!!
Awesome Mir	They used the original audio right? The original version?
XinYu.C	만능의 김채원이야.... Rumor 도 잘 어울려요😭❤️
C Lisa	Let's talk about Minjoo fit to be center ❤. Yena the rapper is so powerful.
셋!둘!	eunbi's top looks kinda like sian's.... **cries in sailed ship sadness**
louisa	Minju acc improved 👏
Biaknei Par	Chaeyeon😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Pls Don't Write sth. About KPop Under My Comment	Dam.. Ich mache mich zu sehr an das vorherige drangewöhnt dass es sich dieses mal so anders anhört xd
Fitri Desi	Ma baby CHAEYEON!!
Dana Geronimo	a Yena se la siente débil en el  rap.. no se si me acostumbre a escuchar la parte de Chowon, pero ella lo hacia fuerte y me gustaba, creo que Yena no es raper, y además su voz es débil (en el  sentido de que es suave)... :c
Hyne Lumor	chaeyeon😍
Won Happy Pil.	Yena did a good job despite being a vocalist.
Valeria Mendoza	Chaeyeonnnnnn
Franco Forgiarini	Sorry but NOPE. The original is way better.
BTS ARMY	to be honest I like the original better but that doesn't mean I hate this one
HONEY DDUK NOCHU	YENA BROUGHT JUSTICE TO THAT RAP PART~
Everton Lopes	For the people who are saying that they did not like this version, you are only saying this because you are accustomed to the produce version, which by the way was very good, but in my opinion that version was much better. Yena just destroyed in rap.  Pro povo que tá dizendo que não gostou dessa versão, vocês só estão dizendo isso porque estão acostumados com a versão do produce, que por sinal ficou muito bom, mas na minha opinião essa versão ficou muito melhor. Yena apenas destruiu no rap.
Ewii Oey	Wow chaeyeon u perfect
みあや 黒木	What's  her name? (1:13)
Izayoi Nacis	Despite the fact that Yena is my favorite in IZ*ONE she still can't replace Chowon's rap part in this song 🔥💕🎶 Still a great performance good job girls, I love Yena's rap somewhat cute and swag but not powerful enough 💖🎶
• SHINee Girl •	CHAEYEON REALLY DID THAT.
EK Hong	♡♡♡♡♡
Piano Yodsaeng	Yena spitting fire tho 🔥🔥
Diana Song	Meanwhile still wishing that the demo version could be release one day...T.T
Park Mindo	Lee sian
Chloe.n	Why nobody talk about Chaewon, she is the fairy girl crush ❤️😍
Rocio Midna	Omg I love Yena's rap
elvise CHEN	chaeyeon wow, amazing dance performance
Margely Colli	EUNBI🔥
Lynsey Scrivener	unpopular opinion - but I prefer this version, rapping is on point their voices both suit the song so well. When I first looked at the practice video I was a bit skeptical about who they chose but they have pleasantly surprised me. Min Ju, wow. She has improved so much!
Ashley Mejia	That rap🔥❤️ I love it Yena and chaeyeon just... wow.
María José	Without Chowon isn't Rumor...
ricsobo	OMG Minjoooo, Destroying the play button!!!!
Paradoxø	I NEED GO YU JIN!
DottieYottie Channel	I love IZ*ONE, but I don't think this concept suited some of the members very much. It was a good performance though, but it also lacked that impact that the OG rumor team gave. IZ*ONE gave their own charm to this which I don't hate. however, I didn't really find myself awed either. chaeyeon fits this concept though!
вуυи нιвα	Ommmgggggg I love this song and the girls are amazing
Adriana Cadena	Ok this is better than pd48 version, who agree?
milka real mora	I miss Sihyun, Sian and Chowon, they made a fierce and strong performance :'( This team is good, but not that cool tbh
Jisoo Perfection	After listening to this version i miss chaewons rap  it actually suits the song
jeon reva	minjoo!😍💙
Szabrina	omg i didn't know that yena is such a great rapper!!
Mukendi Olivier	She's singing in playback!!!
bo xian	MINJU SLAYING THE CENTER GAME AND YENA SLAYING THE RAP GAME I LOVE THIS CONCEPT
hioji_ kakao	Yena is really good in carrying chowon part !!! And chaeyeon good as usual. These two member seriously powerful. The only all rounded member in the group. Can dance, sing high note, and strong rapper.
TaeTae Is life	minju and chaeyeon did really well for this eunbi of course but personally I prefer her original version she abit too cutesy here
LUCY WINSTON	Eyes on Chaeyon most of time..daebak that girl slays...
susu	Chaeyeon rap... Chills
Duong Trang	Main rapper Yena, surprised? Who knows she can do it like a queen like this
fkthenf	ô CAMERAMAN DO MEU ÓDIO
Hayan Nabi	I can’t believe this comment section, I’m super amazed with Yena force. I think this stage was pretty good.
Puffie	hmmm I don't think minju was a good center lol I think she suits pretty pop songs more. she just wasn't a WOW here but WOW to chaewon's voice!! O_O so surprised
Alessandra S	Chowon's rap >>>
Rahma Tham	This song is Chae Yeon style 😂
ichigomiruku	When people thought sihyun wasn’t a strong enough center... she did much better than minjoo. Her and chaewon really takes away the edge of this song.  Why did they choose these two out of all the other girls??
NoxK	Although I love all the 12 members of IZONE,  the original version is more attractive[.
hoshit !	THEY KILLED IT
Jelou how are you ;v	The original is better.
bonjour bon	Yena makes me cringe so hard
hellaxya	i love the izone girls but this made me so sad, mnet profitted of rumor as its most famous pd48 song but sent home p much all the original girls. to replace them feels really sleezy and honestly nothing can replace the og rumor team :(
Maria Susana Mamani Flores	The one who is most into the song is Eunbi but she has the least camera. Very badly raised
bae kyoka	sub-unit ♥
Luwoo To My UwU	I Don’t Get Why People Always Want To Compare And Contrast. 😂😂😂
Op Ru	Minju🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ale	💞MIS BEBITAS HERMOSAAAAS💕
Reem Zakaria	i love both chaeyoen and chowon i cant even :(
Gfriend&Apink&Redvelvet&Wjsn& Fromis9	CHAEYEON DANCER SLAY 💘👑🔥🔥🔥 KWON EUNBI VOICE SLAY 💘👑🔥🔥🔥 KIM MINJU BEAUTY SLAY 💘👑🔥🔥🔥 YENA RAP SLAY 💘👑🔥🔥🔥 CHAEWON PRETTY 😊👑💘😚
dean TheCorgi	I think I know why Eunbi was feeling a bit down. Imagine the feeling of performing Rumor again without the OG member, my point is that the nostalgia behind it makes it sad. I love IZONE, swear. But do think of the memories Eunbi shared with the girls (OG) with this song.   Their version is awesome too, EXO-L supporting IZONE! 💕
Syaza Syazwana	I prefer this version more than original version. Obviously yena's and chayeon's rap is fucking excellent. And others too, they kill it.
Adania Azman	damn chaeyeon and yena join the all-rounder club
Dayu Yuni Styawan	Love it love it love it... RUMOR Song is the best!! And in this performance i just can see chae yeon, ye na and eun bi.. 😍
John Vitug	I think Kang Hye Won should have took Yena’s part and did the rap. I mean her eyes is fierce for this concept and her rap voice is deeper .   Chaeyon did well and of course Eunbi.  Chaewon is so cute to be in this group. I think An yun Jin could have taken her part.  Minju looked seductive but needed more confidence.  I miss the original group but I’m so glad Izone tried their best to interpret this. They did well for what they have, considering most members are cute. It’s hard to pull off a sexy concept
Cianel Alcantara	Am I the only one who feels like crying 😭they've grown so fast
WE FINE	The power of Main Vocal 💕
no.0221	Sakura loving weeaboos absolutely hate this video.
lala linlin	man not to mention this i love their performance so much but i keep looking for chowon and sian in this😂
Yuky Bel	Chaeyeon!!!!!! The best!!!! ❤❤❤❤ talentosa ❤
Ani Tordinava	😱😱😱😱😱 WOW
nice try	sister yena snapped 😳
meli	*sakura voice* CHAEYEON!!!! O-O
Cik Jah	Cheayeon Sing ✔ Rap✔ Dance✔ Highnote✔ Visual✔ Queen✔  Hope she will debut permanent group one day..
Đào Thu Hà	Am i the only one like rap part in this version more than original on the show???
Juliana Ortiz	In love with center Minju 💕
Mina Miruku	God I love the stage...everything was great but it was so obvious they were lipsyncing I wanted yena to make an angry face when doing the rap part with the kind of growl but she was just smiling T-T other than that I think they're so skilled everyone on this stage killed it.
Chou Chou	Cheayeon ❤️❤️
kholoud al-najdi	I’m a fan of all the girls & the song,, but what’s with those facial expressions? The only one that has the concept down is Minju & she’s too pretty for it tbh! On another note, Yena’s rap is 🔥🔥 ..
Almira Yuan Rachmawati	Choi Yena! Wow! Just Wow!!
Разият Гасанбекова	что за уродки
Hajar Cha.	CHAAYEOOON * in Sakura's voice *
Tita nia 2nd channel	when woonyoung join this unit, i think this unit become more sexy vibe so sad bcs she is too young and got bash again
Luciana Ruarte	Insisto en que se parece mucho a rockabye 🤷🏻‍♀️
Eleyna Lee	Just move on from the origin one and accept this new one . The origin may be not forgotten but i think we should give more support to them . What did u get by judge them ? It cannot be change so just move on and dont critize them sm . Much ❤ and no hate 💋 # sorry for my bad english 🍁
Daisuke Motoki	Idk why but no one can replace the original first version of rumor in my ears..
Johnross Manwell	Chaeyeon and Yena are all rounders. Is there anything they can't do? 🤔
Following Gugudan	CHAEYEON KILLED ME 😍😍😍😍  You even can be a rapper 😲😲😲 you can do everything well👍👍👍  SARANGHAE CHAEYEON 😘
Kurumi Touka Tan	Me gustan pero no es la musica Rumor que me gusta quiero a las originales intérpretes
assist king	Yena's rap is good, but her expression is too much. She tried too hard to look strong and sexy, but ended up being cute and it didn't suit for concept of this song.
BLUEBERRY BOO	THE HYPE I CAN'T
Yusn Alz	I think Sunmi gave a birth to a girl named Chaeyeon, look at 1:00 !!!
KaraKara	When Chaewon ranked really high in pd 48 without showing all she can do.. what a queen 😍
ForeverOnce Carat	Original member: Eunbi Replaced: Minjoo, Chaeyeon, Yena, & Chaewon. This line up is so lit 😍🔥
Ashley Son	I think Yena and Chaeyeon were the strongest here
Zo Mii	Yena rap is the best😍😍🔥🔥
Becca Chii	Chaeyeon can do everything. It would have been a complete travesty if she didn't make it in. She's killin' it. I know some preferred the harsher raps of the original but I found the shouting really grating and OTT on the original, I think Yena and Chaeyeon did well at rapping :)
haji4minute	i like it but i suddenly miss Rumor Team huhuhu it feels weird for me well because i used to hear OG Rumor Team Vocals but still izone did a good job!
Mariana Canciani	Choi Yena main rapper💕
Pearl Bnyn	I like iz*one but i do really miss and like the original esp Sihyun, sian and cho won's voice in it
idont care	Glad that they put Minju in this song because she looks similar to the girl who was singing the first line! Nice job!
Army Suga Biased	Del Team solo quedo Eunbi
Merra Clarisse Marino	This version is lit too 🔥 Yeokshi, Rumor isnt complete without Eunbi's voice. Soo love her voice 😍😍 Then wahhhhh, Minjuu with rumor is an unexpectedly perfect pair. Shes so rocking this concept 🖤🖤 Also, didnt expect the rap part. Chaeyeon 💜 and Yena 💜 - their rap version is a precious one. I want to hear it again and again. Soo amazing. Then Chaewonn 😮😍😍 , her voice is still so outstanding. Thumbs up 👍👍 I surely stand with the amazingness of this version. Im so excited for them 😍😍😍
Dinny Nurdiyanti	That "사랑은 Da ra ta ta ta" make my mood lift up 😍😍     Minju-ya you've worked so hard 😍😍😍
Asagiri Kohiruimaki	Excelente canción y coreografía★ sigo diciendo que adoro el estilo de rapeo de Choi Yena☆ y de Lee Chayeon★(⌒‐⌒)

wannable lai kuanlin	its okay😏
Mashu	Why did they put Chaewon in this team ? She isn't bad but she is too sweet looking and not fierce enough. Aside from that I think that Yena's rap was great !!
J-Hope Zin	Thanks for this blessing TT so proud of ma babies - , Eunbi is slayin a leader's power , Yena's rap , Chaeyeon just woah , Minju changed and improuved alot , and Chaewon expressions -

Via Karla Oliverio	I could imagine how gay Ahn Yujin will become watching this video with Minjoo's visuals🤔🤔
Thais Aleixo	this song is so good! the girls did as great as the original rumor team and minju kinda remember sihyun.

hobi tidur	OMG everyone slay in this! Can this be an unit of izone! Btw since minju got her confidence back she looks good in anything i cri
11	They definitely chose the line-up for this performance before 1000%, because this is PERFECTION. Yena's rap is amazing, Chaewon's voice actually suits the lines she has, and of course, the OG Kwon-celeb

Maria Emídio	Yena 😍😍😍
Michael Ferido	I love this performance, but it kinda irks me that yena is rapping Chowon's rap part, im still on the hangover of Chowon na making at the top 12. But everyone deserves to debut specially chaeyon :)
ProtectHobifromSnakeu	0:35 OMG WHO SHE?! and is it just me or she has some resemblence with Jennie?

Anthony R.	I prefer original performance from the show.  They killed it back then.
Farizt Maulana	1:01 Chaeyeon really did that facial expression :)
っみ	や、やべえ！！！！
__ming ming__	no matter what you say, im still prefer H.I.N.P stage. why? -dance, vocal and rap are more powerful  -visuals are the best (can't be replaced) -eunbi's vocal sounds wayyyyyyy better than this stage (her voice's kinda sleepy on this stage?!) -honestly, execpt chaeyeon, everybody isn't really "fit" with this song (i mean on this stage, even eunbi, her voice sounds totally different from pd48 stage). not hate but minju and yena are really really really not fit with this song at all. minju is a weak vocalist and yena's rap is kinda weird, maybe too childish? (btw i miss chowon T^T) -and dance, excuse me, (execpt chaeyeon) where's your energies? finally, that's just my opinion, don't bash me
Yebin Biased	Eunbi, you are doing amazing sweetie 💜
Ryne Baniqued	I already knew that Chaeyeon can rap even before PD48 started, there's a video of her rapping (audition tape) she's so young in that video.Now you're all shooked by the legit queen. 😛  The beat seems a bit faster than the original one. 😕
래어템라미의	은비는 여기저기 보다보니 얼굴표정연습이랑 립씽크 입씽크연습좀 해야할듯. 그래도 화이팅 이제 시작이니!
Sassy Queen	This is great tho, but i prefer the produce48 ver. I MISS CHOWON' POWERFUL RAP, SIHYUN' ICONIC "DARATATATA", SIAN' "TOXIC", SAE "OOH NA NA NA"
wan	I like Yena, but her rap, i don't know man. 🙂
ViRN	Minjoo looks a little miserable 😭
Sis Uhuks	Lips sync????
Grape Gamer	Its 1:30A.M and im here
dill brhn	Yena 😍😍
Ker Lor	Omg yena is awesome....
bangtanpink	Eunbi😍😍😍👏👏👏
S V	Chaewon was a bit too smiley and cutesy for this performance which kind of ruined the group’s dynamic in my opinion. Minju did try to be fierce but it just felt a bit underwhelmed. Chaeyeon, Yena and of course original Eunbi were great for the song tbh, they have the fierceness.
monday blues	minju is so charismatic tho. like i didn't expect her to match this concept well but her low (?) voice and her facial expressions were on point 💖
Shelou Baigan	CHAEYEON JUST KILLED THIS IM DONE
Sunshine Adeline Mackie	I think the concept version is better. But yeah still good job 😁😁
Siti Mai	Lee chaeyeon fighting
JOY HPY	Minju so sexy.😳💕🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

WheeByulHwaSun	This makes me so happy coz Chaeyeon gets to perform this. I do have to say, I miss the Oringal5 But by far, this sounds the most similar as compared to all PD101/PD48 songs
Deleted User	Love this song 💖💖👏🏾
Guilherme Borges	this song was made by kwon.
Jasmin Aminuddin	2:09 I love this part so much!!! Errgghhh

;; rae sup	A NU MAMEZ, ARTE
Ju S	I MISS GO YUJINNNN 💔 BUT I LOVE IZONE❤️
soft rosee	Okay but I Am in the beginning made me sad :')
D Daeboreum	Produce48 ver is better. Rumor is not only acting sexy but also full of strength, and I can't feel it here (of course except Eunbi, she's always a great vocalist). The others does not fit the song. This center's facial expression...I have no idea... I remember the produce48 ver, center was wow, she was shine like purple diamond when it came to the 'da da da da..' part. And Sian's skill in dancing was like a boom. Well, it's my opinion, hope they would try harder in future.
viajaycay	I love minju but i think sian's facials suited this concept more but ill still support these girls
MrBubblygoodness	Minju is so pretty but wow her expression is really lacking.
Wales Channel	Goddess Minjoo turn into baddass Minjoo

Quynh Vu Thuy	They're really good but Idk why for me the 1st Rumor team still the best for me🤧🤧.
arisa hariri	Is that the same outfit they wore before?
Seonho is Not byeongari anymore	WHY NOT ROLLIN’ ROLLIN’? ISN’T IT THE MOST POPULAR AND THE WINNER?
สนุก จังโว้ย	Better than the old center of rumore lol
Geo Nino	Original Produce 48 is better than this one. But this version is good.  Just miss sihyun to be center and killing part.
Angelica Rys	sorry but yena's voice is betraying her 😂 she looks so cuteeeee 😭😭😭 even when growling how--
Mora H.N	I like this version more tbh. Chaeyeon slayed like always 🔥 And i have to admit, Minju really surprised me ! Her expression, voice and visual ! 😻💙 They all did well ! I'm so proud of them ! 💙
THEGIRLWITH EVILFACE	it's okay, though I expected much. I feel like it's weak but it's their own style.
Aisha Hussain	Min ju vibe is not strong enough for this song 😅
el vee	I wish the camera sequence was the same as the last time,  giving the highlight to whom part is it.   but love it, the song sound a little different but a good one. nice!
Grizzly Bear	How the hell do we got Tzuyu and Irene in one stage together like this?!

Yul Yen	Yena where did you learn how to growl like that?😂😍🦆❤❤
screamingtroy	Eunbi, Chaeyeon, and Yena slaying once again, but it just doesn't sound right without Chowon's rap. I wish they did this with Yujin instead of Chaewon but that's just me.
Xoë Suejung	Minju did really well, but I agree with others saying this stage seemed to have the wrong energy for the concept. It was still a good stage though.

Anony Mous	Chaeyeon never fails!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Yee Luen Law	I miss the original version with Sian, Sihyun, Sae, Chowon and Eunbi. This version is not bad, but I feel like it missed something. The original one was more powerful, but elegant and sexy at the same time.

M Catungal	Yena x Chaeyeon rap dang!!!!
Mikayla Merna	I feel that the original rumor is legendary especially Sian's starting nae toxic, chowon's rap, siyeon's glares and sae's love is blind sexy aura But I'm impressed by yena's rap and that fierce claw and expressions which make her rapping parts looks better and more aggressive like chowon's
Claudia Soyeon Nah	Now I'm having 3 .mp3-files of 'Rumor' on my phone 😆 Demo version, Produce48 version and IZ*ONE version. I love ALL of them!!!!! ❤🎧❤🎧❤🎧❤
Lesley Marie Paderes	chaeyeon omg,singing,dancing and now rapping,youre all in one

Anggraini Nie	OMG CHAEYEON MY EYES CANT STOP LOOKING AT YOU!!!
multi fandom	*WOOO YENAAA RAP FANTASTIC* 🔥🔥🔥😧
Sherine Chioe	omygosh im in love
Arfiyan Kun	I still prefer the original one which is sung by finalist of PD48.
Code 7	I love IZ*ONE even though a lot of my faves didn't get it, but I feel like the lyrics/beat of the song asks for passion and almost frustration. I think it lacked energy in the beginning... maybe they wanted to make the girls' voices cuter and i even felt like the song was going slower. HOWEVER I think from the chorus on it started getting better ^_^
Melanie Tan	Chaeyeon can sing, dance and even RAP well omg what else does she know how to do?? stan talent stan chaeyeon 💖
Sasha Audita	YENAAAAA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Olivia Sanders	Legit minjus opening gave me goosebumps WTF 💜💜   you know what NVM the whole thing gave me goosebumps 😂

Narsih Ica	honnestly, izone without kaeun isn't perfect in my opinion.
야애리	the cameraman is so biased🙄
HwangMinhyun Is so handsome	yena rap is powerful❤❤❤
Keichan Zel	hey uh cameraman? u have something against chaeyeon? cuz why you keep avoiding her smh
Jean Souza	Rumor ver. IZ*ONE never will be iconic like version with Eunbi, Sian, Chowon e Kim Si Hyeon. But I love it  Minju as center and Yena as rapper.
Shalotte Kassie	For me, i'm little bit disappointed on this version.The way to perform this song had to be strong, chic, powerful and confident. I think Minju is only one who slay this stage with her inner. Chaeyeon and EunBi did quite good but I also can see some nervous on hers face. Yena look too cute than chic ,powerful or confident.For Chaeyeon, her dancing skill is the best but it so annoying me that she kept smile while perform this stage.They're all look so confused on song concept. Anyways, It's ok for their first show-con.
0. keiko	I kinda wished they could be fiercer
Eray G	Song is nothing without Chowon 😔
chan eri	さえぴぃ、、、、
WRXIMPREZARED2018 SUBARU	Chaeyeon, Minju and Yena is the best. Eunbi and Chaewon is so horrible in singing and dancing. Voice so cracking in Eunbi and Chaewon. Overrated flower snake Eunbi and Chaewon.
• skitz	Why did they reuse all they clothes? It brings a lot of memory tho
rizqi laila	Miss Lee Sian , Han Cho Won, and Kim Si Hyun
Angel sky	ficou horrivel :( a versao do produce 48  é mil vezes melhor...essa versao parece q elas tao morrendo de tanto desanimo na voz pqp ....as outras cantavam e dançavam cheias de energia e essas ai parecem ta morta , só a Eunbi q salvou já q ela tbm estava na outra formaçao

otakuloveskpop	I found it nice except for the part of the girl with the overly cute voice... I like seeing Chae and Yena tho. ❤
Yoocarie Yui	Minju is slaying for being the center 💖
walkingdead	I don't know if anyone noticed, the original singers of 1000% (Minju, Chaeyeon) got swapped  to Rumor but the original singer of Rumor (Eunbi) remains in the same song and the same part as main vocal. I don't think anybody else can slay this chorus like she did.
Adi Irawan	Waiting for this song with 12 member!
patchichoco	The OG Rumor team was strong but i find that Chaeyeon and Yena are strong too. However I find that Eunbi is kinda weak in facial expressions, Minju is just a quiet pretty face while Chaewon is just lacking fierceness. It lacks impact but this one is good too in some way.
黃子芸	Oops...i still love Chowon's rap
Yvette Dela cruz	Sian twerk and chowon rapping this song :(
cyntya mitha	When yena and chaeyeon become baddas and me just a proud mom here :')
hyunlady	Omggg minjuuu chaeyeonnnnn😍😍 1000% izone vers is such a pleasant surpised! Thought they will have Rollin Rollin instead omgg and they let center minju and main vocal chaeyeon on rumour team instead doing their original 1000%!! Center minju for rumour and center sakura wonyoung for 1000%!!!😍😍😍😍😍

Diệu Huyền	Chaeyeon ahh
superior shackcoult	I saw eunbi and chaeyon i click 😘 eunbi really looks like Irene is some angle.  😍😍

Улбосын Исабекова	This version of rumor much better than before . Chaeyeon’s rap are awesome, yenas rap are awesome they killed me. I’m biased now
dorky lalalisa	Yena is on fire. Now i now who’s their main rapper hahahha
ANJ	Yena did great but Chowon's rap left such a huge impression to me that everytime her part comes in I wanna hear Chowon's voice.
LetsBurn MnetSnake	chayeon, yena and minju doesnt look like sound their voice
acha chaa	THIS IS SO COOL I CANT😍😭
Tifany Octavia	Chowon best
Pitchie Patt	Chaeyeon is really suit this song!!
Sothea Khe	Many comment thinking they not use to this Rumor, well that because we used to listen to this as Produce 48 version for so long, that why it make us feel a bit strange. But this is a great performance, just the member in here like Minju, Chaewon is use to cute and girly concept, and this could be their first time trying more sexy concept, that give us different feeling from the orignal. For Cheyeon and Yena, it is in there league so no problem. And we have, mommy Eunbi, the only original member.    So if everyone doesn't like it cuz is different from the original Rumor, then it can't be help since that is their voice and their visual. Just try to compliment them a bit for their hard work on practice this song.
BLiNK CissiE	Minju fits for this song. she dance so sexy... 😍😍😍
Yến A.R.M.Y	Chaeyeon 😍

Diana Zharkynbek kyzy	omg this team consists of my biases  T^T
selma sunde	YENA THE FUUUCK WHAT A RAPPING LEGEND AND CHAEYEON TOO O MAI GAD
Son Elizabeth	I don't wanna sound like hater, bc I love IZ*ONE girls but this stage it feels so sweet and pacifist?  This song is powerful and elegant at the same time, the rap is good but for a cute song, the producers of the song said that the rap was very important, and *Cho Won* killed that part + *Eunbi* vocals it was a perfect duo who no one in IZ*ONE can replace :/
pristin’s official promoter	minju improved so much!!!! i’m honestly so proud
Josh The Pentakid	did you guys notice that they are wearing the original clothes of team rumor? lol!
gerg nim	This is not disappointing. Y'all are just used to the original one, and I think this version is great as well!
Cupids 5210	It hurt for me to see this as i love the original too much.
Thy Tran Ai	Chaeyeon's so gorgeous and sexy. :))))))
Jeonjk	I know it It is hard to dance and sing at the same time and also bc they are a rookie group but they lip sync throughout the whole showcase. Kind of disappointed, I'll have to wait and see.

prnindaa ._	Pls do not compared yena and chowon they're both good
hazel paredes	I heard na go eun's high note in 00:19. I miss her  Go IZONE! ❤️❤️❤️

john paul	CHOI YENA INVENTED RAP
shuensha.daku	When the video of the rumor concept evaluation came out, people were complaining that it doesn't feel right because it wasn't like the demo version. Now they're bitching that this is too cute. Get over it already
Rizka Hami	I don't meant to compare this version with the original one.. But the original group were more fierce.. And yes i miss lee sian and chowon the powerfull rapper..
Ajeng Novi	Yena's rapp remind me on PD48 when she teaches Rumor team. Dream come true 😂😂
Hiname HD	I Can hear the auto tune to much sometimes ;( But oof they still shook me
Thunder Star	I don’t find Yena charming and talented at all. She’s trying hard to be funny and cute. Her sexy and serious expression when performing on stage is so cringy too
Hoimonti Bilasi	Sorry to say but they haven't the same strong emotion as the real one. It's my opinion. I like Eunbi X Sian X Sihyun X Chowon X Sae most. None can replace their position. TY.
j JAMS	Who is the girl who gave the high note at the end? Her voice is really nice
HeungDub Jjang	yena nailed it at 2:09

Edison Guevarra	Yena did great in rapping. But now I think the shouting in chowon's part actually fits the song. Especially before the 2nd chorus. It helps in building the climax.

Detested One	To be honest, i like to see Eunbi performed this song on PD48 than now, 'cause she was more charismatic on PD48. But i like this rap part more than on PD48, Yena was really killing it.   Stay safe and healthy girls! from now they will be busy and be restless for promoting their group and album. Hope that Off The Record give their best for them.

Kheiron Spade	All of them did great!  From Minju, her facial expression fits to the song and she improved very well! Yena’s rap is aggressive plus the opposite of being soft is very amazing! Chaeyeon can do everything from dancing, singing, to rapping. Of course, Eunbi is still the main vocal in this song which I love the most. Lastly, Chaewon’s voice is so freaking versatile like it can fit to any genre. I’m so proud!!!!!!
itsalmoura	I MISS SIAN

jimin park	this is my opini : menurutku si suaranya kurang powerfull, cuma eunbi doang yang kena powerfull nya, yang lain suaranya cenderung lembut, terus konsep saxynya kurang dapet, kurang nakal kalo di bandingin sama tim national hot isue pd48

First chaeyeon's "mito mito mito boy" i like his gaze there so sharp and she slayed it. Then her cute giggles in the last part she looks cute there. Yena's rap i really like it, so powerful an sharp Chaewon's part i really like her voice it's gentle but it's still suit the song Eunbi she still suits her part and i like it and lastly our center, wow minju she suits the song. She's so sexy there and looks different that how she usually was.   Rumor IZ*ONE version I LIKE IT!!!!    Also i know how happy chaeyeon was to show this to us, you can see it from her smiles.
Han Chowon fan 01	Somehow I miss Chowon voice ㅜㅜ miss her so much. I wish I can see her debut in future.

kopxpert	1:51 Love this "walking" part!!!! Listen to the ROAR from the crowd Btw Minju is unexpectedly AWESOME in this stage. Yena & Chaeyeon slayed the rap parts and Chaewon didnn't look out of place AT ALL. As for Eunbi... what more can I say. It's her song after all. She's great as always and this Rumor perfomance probably wouldn't feel complete without her. Great job girls!!
Moon Byulyi is Moon Byutiful	remember when Yena told Eunbi to just act like Go Yoojin maybe that's why she became the main rapper XD

stan A.C.E for good grades and clear skin	Holy shit Yena
Lissa Oh	chaeyeon suited rumor!!!
Lehmi Nurulsuci	Nah the original (H.I.N.P) is still better though chaewon really slay her parts... The first rap part should be done like the original too, and minju as a center and covering Sian's part at the start is really weak and didn't do justice to the song... Fight me if you're not agree but this is the truth... The start is really weak and the line/part distribution should be done the way the original had, or even better follow the demo (if i remember correctly the one as center is the main vocal there)...
