This is because the buyer and the consumer are different. Whereas you could buy a car and also use it, the doctor buys (prescibes) the drug for the patient who then consumes it. That said, the economics are different in different countries. In the states I believe the pharmas can pay insurances companies which in turn join hands with hospitals, and the benificiaries of the lobbying becomes the whole medical industry.\n\nIn Korea, we have univeral coverage by the government, and because the primary buyers of drugs are the insurance provider (the government), they have dominant control over the pricing of drugs. Gov can say "thats too expensive bring the price down or we\'re not going to cover it or even worse not allow it in the market." This does happen and sometimes leads to drugs or medical products not being available.\n\nThat said, I think the trump admin\'s move to clarify costs in pharma ads is 100% the right move.

Pharmacies do not all charge the same price, especially for generic medications. You shop around before buying a car or a TV and should do the same for your prescription medications, especially those that don't have insurance, have high deductible or catastrophic plans or those with Medicare part D where you have to worry about going into the donut hole.

Out of every 5,000 drugs developed, only 5 make it to human trials and out of those 5 only 1 makes it to the market. It takes lots money to develop and get a drug approved and pharmaceutical companies have to recoup that money just like any business.  Yes there are lots of shady things that go on and even as a pharmacist I encourage people to do other things like lifestyle changes instead of having to be put on medications but sadly, most Americans don't want to have to do that and are looking for a magic pill.

Even if your insurance covers a medication, eventually someone has to pay for it. \n\nAt the end of every year, insurance companies evaluate how much they paid out in claims and predict how much they will have to pay out over the next year. This is how your insurance rates are calculated. \nSo, when everyone wants to be on the latest and greatest med or see specialist or have expensive procedures etc, that all ultimately raises the prices of your insurance. \n\nBut from an immediate standpoint an individual just sees it as ‚Äúgreat! My insurance covers it and my copay is only $xxx. Not considering what the original price was and how eventually everyone on that insurance plans ends up having to pay for it. \n\nThis is how small companies insurance rates go through the roof when someone is diagnosed with an expensive disease like cancer or an autoimmune disease which has some of the highest priced drugs out there. \n\nSure, insurance companies may have negotiated lower prices but on a say $1000 medication, how much do you think they can really negotiate that down to? And that‚Äôs once a month for 12 months. That REALLY adds up when more and more people go to ask their doc for the latest and greatest meds. \n\nThere‚Äôs a reason why you see ads for what you see, those are the money makers. Drugs that have huge prices. Go look up the cost of Humara and Lyrica which I‚Äôm constantly seeing adds for. \n\nA lot of these could be solved if we had a single payer system and the government utilized its bargaining power.

Consider this scenario:  You have health insurance which pays your families medical expenses.  Your child breaks their arm.  There are 2 doctors in your town.  One doctor will put the childs arm in a cast for $50.  The other doctor will put the childs arm in a cast for $500.  You pay nothing regardless of which doctor you go to.  Which doctor are you going to take your child to?  The cheap one?  No.  This creates what I call reverse capitalism.  The more you charge, the more reputable your medical service appears to be, and the more business you will get.  The existence of medical insurance creates this.  So when people see they could take a $5/pill solution for their back pain... or take the $150/pill solution, and their insurance is footing the bill in either case... they ARE going to go for the more expensive one.

It might also increase the price of medications, in the long run, causing things like the epipen price jack that we had because of the owner of the brand increasing the price by 400-500% making it almost impossible for those in poverty to afford a life-saving medication. It could also be like insulin where the price to buy it around the world is around $5 to $10 per vial while in the U.S. it is over $300. this increase means that people who need it to survive will not have the medication and will die from it. This means that if the prices go public both the on brand prices and the generic prices will increase. this price increase will cause thousands if not millions of people to die from not being able to afford their medications.

When I go for reimbursement from the insurance they tell me that my reimbursement of $100 will be in the next check they send us. This means insurance companies choose how much they will pay. It sets the entire attitude of the market thus falsely inflating pricing. I want to buy cheap and sell higher to afford to stock the medication and make a profit. Manufacturers sell for higher because they need to turn a profit too, sometimes too greedy like EpiPen. In the end since the insurance chooses how much to pay, if at all (chargebacks are something where they change their mind after covering it initially), the market is forced to jack prices up to make their own profit.

True they might be able to get the price earlier if they are resourceful, but advertisements would be the main way to find out prices for any product.\n\nSo you could consider it a "trap" once you find out the price you are already fairly invested in getting it, meaning competition cannot do its work. The argument of saying "insurance would make the prices meaningless" is likely a completely bogus standpoint as well, since most insurance companies I know of use percentage of cost for prescriptions, so if its 50% then they can look at the price has halved with their insurance. If the cost-benefit ratio of the drug is far behind the completion then insurance companies would likely refuse to, or cover less of it, therefore less people would get it and they would feel the need to drop their price so the insurance companies cover it in a similar fashion to similar drugs.', 'Michael Ford': "I honestly do think this will cause them to lower their prices.

But it may change the pricing models for some drugs like antidepressants of which there are dozens of varieties on the same basic models: SSRIs and SNRIs. There are even drugs within these classes with basically the same mechanism of action.

Luckily I have the joy of working with these students and helping them realize that college is an option - I help them with financial aide, scholarships, finding a job, and sometimes even the moving process - and I\'m happy to report that many of them are now in college/are thinking of a future where college is in it.  But all of them - the students and their families - just automatically assume that they won\'t be able to afford it, and thus don\'t even attempt to make it work or question it.

I'd rather see them tackle *that* bullet point first. It's down to each insurance company to negotiate, and there are thousands of plans out there. It's crazy convoluted. \n\nHowever, there's also the PBMs - Pharmacy Benefit Managers. They're the middle men who are supposed to help health insurance companies manage their drug policies, as well as negotiate what kind of profit pharmacies will make off each drug. So, big pharmacies, like Walgreens, Walmart and CVS, can negotiate more profit, while small home-town pharmacies can't. I actually had to stop filling two of my scripts at my independent pharmacy, because my insurance wasn't even going to pay them the cost of the drugs, let alone a profit. Walmart? No problem filling them. If you need to pay full price for a drug, Walgreens is one of the most expensive places to fill. PBM contracts have a lot to do with that. \n\nThose costs get passed up the chain, too, to the drug manufacturers. There's also some shady kick-back programs to the PBMs. And that doesn't even include the kickbacks their reps get for selling a practice on a certain drug.\n\nIt's a ridiculously tangled process, and it's difficult to follow the paper trail. Putting up the drug prices may help people understand just what these meds cost, and look at what their insurance company is paying. It's a step, a small step which may help get more accountability and transparency from PBMs, since the pharmaceutical companies will want to point fingers elsewhere. \n\nI'm cynical about it though.

Your doctor should be the one that determines treatment and explains the process and options to you. Not drug ads and not drug companies paying off that doctor to prescribe expensive, and potentially less effective products when better or cheaper options exist. Advertising drugs makes drugs more expensive because ads are extremely expensive. So bite the bullet and ban advertisement. If Americans truly want cheaper prescriptions, the first step is outright banning ads. The next step is socialised healthcare. The reason medical treatment is cheap in the UK is because there\'s a board that decides which medical treatment/equipment/drugs gets the monopoly. That means medical companies have to substantially reduce costs to be in the running. If they lose their bid, hardly any of their product will ever be used in that whole of the UK. It still has a chance as an alternative for people who have allergies or reactions to the chosen product, but that\'s still an overall loss. And it\'s not that the cheapest option always wins. If another product is more efficient,  even if it costs more, it\'ll win the bid, but, again, they have to have substantially reduced costs to even be considered. That\'s an intense competition. That\'s serious capitalism at work for all the socialized healthcare haters. It\'s an all or nothing competition, and it works in people\'s favour. That\'s why the exact same treatment in the UK costs significantly less.  There\'s no difference in the treatment, there\'s just no money wasted by companies having to pay off hospitals and doctors to be the product of choice, or spend billions on advertising.

What I do know in the pharmacy when a person comes in with a prescription, unless it is expressly written my the doctor to be a brand name or you refuse to have the therapeutic equivalent (generic) you will get the generic which is cheaper for you. Although not all drugs have a generic... So if the drug companies have to place their prices on their ads they could sly and put the price for one pill not one month supply. The likely won\'t include the name of a generic possible because another drug company makes it. And of course they don\'t know how much each person\'s insurance will cover from their price.

On paper I can see how this reads well to Republicans as its not really directly infringing on companys\' bottom lines but it is "increasing competition". I actually agree with the Pharma companies that adding the price to the commercial is pretty much useless. As it is Insurance companies barter for better prices so that affects how much you (the watcher of the commercial) would end up paying for it and that fact renders the listed price essentially useless unless you don\'t have any insurance and pay for drugs entirely on your own. A far better idea to increase competition and decrease prices would be to disallow advertising on media for pharma companies. 10 minutes of watching those commercials will tell you why they are predatory and removing them would mean that its on your doctor to inform you about different medications or on the consumer to do their own research and talk to their doctor about options. The bad side of that would be that if the government did nothing else after disallowing ads then Pharma companies would likely pump all that ad money into salespeople and bombard doctors to prescribe their drug instead of others so that would need to be addressed in some way but even with that potential I still think its much better to just stop Pharma from being able to advertise on media just like we did with Smoking companies decades ago.

While most doctors would tell you that it\'s not the right medication, I can imagine there are a ton of people telling their doctors that they experience the symptoms, and the medication looks the best for them, so in order to stop arguing with the patient, the doctor simply prescribes the drug for them. It\'s one of my biggest pet-peeves when someone goes into the doctor\'s office to tell them what prescription they need. Instead, the assumption should be that the doctor, who went to school for 8 years to help you with the exact reason why you\'re visiting them, as a job, probably knows better than you do about what medication you should take.\n\nWith this law, it would change the discussion from "I know what I need, and it\'s this medication I saw on TV," to "I know I want this medication on TV, but it\'s really expensive." That would allow the doctor to more easily suggest a different medication that could cost less. The unfortunate reality of the situation is that people care more about their money, than their own well-being. If they go to the doctor without considering the cost of the medication they want will be, then they\'re more likely to fight the doctor for it, because who doesn\'t want to live the lavish lifestyle presented on TV? If they are looking for knowledge when they enter because they can\'t really afford the medication they saw on TV, the doctor can then a lot easier persuade you into buying the kind of medicine that would not only better fit your symptoms, but would also be cheaper. This could help a ton when it comes to the medications reducing their prices because they wouldn\'t be making as much from the commercials, and in an effort to keep advertising their medicine, but making it affordable to the average person, they\'d lower it to something actually reasonable.\n\nI am largely in favor of this law because, at the bare minimum, it forces prescription medicine commercials to be even more informative. I think it\'s dumb we have them in the first place because I don\'t think any doctor outside of the United States and New Zealand get people who come in to tell them what medicine they want, and instead they actually listen to their doctor.\n\nTL;DR Medicines on TV are cool, and people will TELL their doctor to prescribe it to them. If the price shows, then they\'ll inquire as to what is cheaper, rather than simply telling the doctor what they think they need.

Websites tend to offer more information than a TV spot anyway.\n\n3) Drug companies are manipulative little shits.

God fucking forbid we understand our potential as individuals.\nBut as long as there\'s a way to make money off of us, instead, the consumer will get a more affordable price for these glorified bandaids, and we\'re gonna act like this is a good thing when we start seeing things change. Which will look like more access to pills, which will ultimately lead to more unhappy people investing in a flimsy answer for their troubles. Which, as a reminder, this leads to more already impoverished people buying pills that promise happiness and relief, but have a huge risk of killing you, or causing serious harm. Even something as simple as changing your pill routine can cause Antipsychotic drug-induced dysphoria, like Chester Bennignton, or even myself which lead Chester to kill himself, and which led me to my suicide attempt. Plenty of people walk away from a failed regimen with tardive dyskinesia, a condition where you can\'t control your facial movements anymore which can ultimately cause more shame, embarrassment, and depressive behavior than you had before you tried to fix it with a pill. There are so many potential risks with these pills that you just *have* to stop and think "Is it worth it?"\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nAsk yourself why you think you need the pills.\nThe answer is your needs are not being met in your current environment. Which will cause symptoms that doctors will claim is something wrong with your body, your brain. Don\'t let a salesman with a stethoscope fool you. Anyone can shop for doctors nowadays, and get several different diagnosis until they find the one that suits them, ultimately letting a label define them. This frustrates me to no end.\n\nMy parents shopped around for a doctor starting at age 6. I\'ve been diagnosed with everything from Bipolar, to Borderline Personality Disorder, to Mood Disorder not specified, to ODD, ADD, Vitamin Deficiency, PTSD, ... each doctor saying the doctor before them was wrong and that they have it right. When parents are looking for an answer to why their kid is so fucked up, they\'re never going to place blame onto themselves. Especially if the child doesn\'t disclose any sexual abuse going on. So I got pill after pill, diagnosis after diagnosis, 10 day hospitalizations with every missed dose, or regimen change. These pills, and my belief in them, took 12 years of my life.\n\nNeedless to say I don\'t take them anymore. I still have bad days, yeah. I still become depressed and feel extremely deeply. I can be moody and downright intolerable to many people, but I wouldn\'t have it any other way. I\'m not living for them, I\'m living for me.

Medication is a huge subject to confront. Let me know if any of this has changed, especially since when I went to school. First, this doesn't take into account that insurance companies, whenever there is a choice, will always go for the less-expensive medication, i.e. the generic brand. Why? Because the medication is the same. That way they get to pay less and, in return, so do you. \n\nSecond, doctors these days are being taught to, unless it is a condition that is already well underway, go for the non-medication route. People are not taking care of themselves. If in roughly 6 weeks nothing changes despite active participation on the patient's part, then medication is prescribed. Sometimes less time, sometimes more. \n\nThird, doctors can and will change medication to suit the individual. \n\nFourth, honestly it's talked about how such advertisements for medications are the bane of a doctor's existence. People see these ads and wonder if they need these medications, but it's up to the doctors and the insurance companies to dole them out or not. By this time these medications are known by these doctors. Some patients will go around to doctors until they get the medication they want.\n\nFifth, there are incentives for doctors to prescribe medications by the drug manufacturer. That needs to fucking change. It's not so blatant as all that since that's actually illegal, but it's been known to happen. That needs to change. \n\nSixth, brand name medications are already fucking protected under federal law that no generic brand will make the same drug for years so the brand name is exclusive. It's a double-edged sword in a way, though one side may be more sharp than the other. It gives the drug more time out in the world with a larger testing group (even though they are rigorously tested beforehand) to see what could happen on a much larger scale. It also may prevent people who do need the medication but cannot afford it from getting the help they need, since generic drugs must also prove that they are the same on every level to their brand counterpart.", 'Josefin S': 'As a physician (working in a country with universal healthcare and high cost-protection) I obviously think this is better than nothing. However, in the long run, I think the best way to protect patients from high prices would be a high-cost protection for prescription drugs.\n\nI.e: Patients only pay full price for their drugs until a certain threshold. After that, they pay a progressively cheaper price until they\'ve reached the "maximum spending" threshold (the maximum amount you have to spend on drugs in a year), after which they get their drugs for free until a year has passed since the first purchase. Then the cycle starts again.\n\nThe system is of course financed through taxes. It is quite good for keeping the prices down aswell because if I prescribe a brand name drug to a patient, the pharmacy will switch it to the cheapest non-brand eqivalent. This obviously motivates the companies to keep their prices down. (If I for some reason don\'t want the drug switched, I can note that on the prescription and the patient will get the more expensive one, still within high cost-protection. If my medical opinion is that it doesn\'t matter whether the drug is switched or not, but the patient wants the brand name drug anyway, they can get that one, but they have to pay for the price difference themselves.)\n\nAs for drug-ads: I think it is weird to advertise for prescription drugs. It is not like any other consumer product that you go shopping for at leisure. I am all for transparency, but I don\'t think that ads are the best providers of that. Obviously I would personally never withhold vital information from my patients, or purposefully decieve them in any way, and of course I think they should be able to do their own research. Here, we have a sort of national registry of all drugs on the market. It is available online for free, and there is information written in leymans terms as well as in "med speech".

Every individual insurance plan is extremely unique and has a varied formulary and tier system associated with it. As a current pharmacy school student with over five years in the work environment I have seen the astronomical wholesale price of drugs at its worst, and insurance company\'s refusal to cover the cost of them. on the contrary I have seen insurance plans approve astronomical amounts although it often takes some problem solving by the pharmacists to achieve this. A good pharmacist will work to provide the best care for the patient, and this includes finding an affordable treatment option. often times the insurance companies will not provide enough information to a consumer to choose the cheapest treatment option and it turns into a trial and error process between the prescriber and pharmacy. adding yet another level of complexity to the issue is the use of drug manufacture coupons. I feel as if a small portion of the population is aware of the potential manufacture rebates that can be obtained to make their medication affordable. They often think (and are told by their pharmacy) that if insurance has paid on the medication, that is the bottom dollar price. this is often not true. Although there are a lot of financial avenues to negate the price they almost never work with federally or state funded insurance plans. this leaves the patients that are usually in the most need for the expensive brand name drugs (covered by Medicare or Medicaid) ineligible for this price break. overall, my recommendation would be to find a pharmacy and a pharmacist near you that is going to fight on your behalf and work with you to get you the care that you need. I have a strong opinion that this level of care is more prevalent in an independent pharmacy over a chain pharmacy. I avoid making that blanket statement that every pharmacist at a chain pharmacy won‚Äôt go out of their way to help the patient, but often times in the independent pharmacy, the pharmacists behind the counter has a vested interest in building a personal relationship with each patient. The common misconception that drugs are cheaper at large chain pharmacies is flat out untrue, aside from the "Wal-Mart $4 List" that is heavily advertised. Although this sounds like an amazing price, most independent drug stores will work with you to achieve the same price point on those drugs.\n\nTLDR: Find a pharmacist that will go to bat for you and this becomes a non-issue.

Both made by different insulin pharma companies (IPC). \nI‚Äôve contacted them both and asked what price they sell the insulin to the insurance companies (IC) here in the USA. They cannot answer that question because different IC get it at different prices. So I asked about my IC pricing. They referred me to my IC. \nWhen prodded further about their COST to produce said insulin they said they can‚Äôt give me answer about that because ‚Äúit varies‚Äù. How? I don‚Äôt know and they wouldn‚Äôt explain further than ‚Äúit‚Äôs the materials needed to produce the insulin that can fluctuate.‚Äù\nI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case but I‚Äôm not the one making insulin so I don‚Äôt know. \nI think one of the main issues is insurance companies. They need to pay a certain amount of the cost of the rx. So in turn the distributor hikes up the price to get more out of the IC because they will only get a small percentage from the consumer. \nWhen I get insulin it costs me almost 200$ a month. \nInsurance is currently around 202$ a week. \nI go see the doctor every 6 months and have a 50$ copay plus what ever blood work I need to get done which is typically about 100-150$. \nBlood strips (measuring the glucose level) is the generic type by my pharmacy. 15$ a month. \nI miss work sometimes to be able to control my glucose levels. Although I‚Äôm very lucky and can work from home if need be and I also take very good care of myself. \nWe need to redo the healthcare system. \nMake it so you pay the doctor. Not the IC. \nUse IC as supplemental insurance. Not the one you rely on. \nThe doctors will then compete for the better pricing.

One of the most irritating things was frequently having to deal with a brand new and expensive medication sent over by a doctor most likely getting paid to give it out, only to have to fill out prior authorizations for the insurance company that the doctor would take more than a week to do and then having to special order the medication. And after all of that, with the patient calling more and more irate every day, ending up with a $50 co-pay that they didn‚Äôt want to pay in the first place.\n\nThe whole system is incredibly flawed.', 'Lorraine Seglayen': 'Wow.

This will also drive down cost with hospitals and doctors.\nI get that health insurance companies have deals and such with drug companies, hospitals and doctors.  And those prices should be shown per health insurance agency if they are different from regular expected prices, so that the price difference can be seen.

I sell maybe 50 or more prescriptions a day, and I have the ability to not only look up the price before insurance of a drug, but also the generic equivalent price, and how much we paid for it as a store (and thus our markup). I think one of the worst drugs that\'s incredibly expensive is drugs like viagra or other equivalents.\n\nTypically they can be up to 50$ per pill for the brand! And although upping the pill amount on a prescription can lower the price-per-pill down to maybe 40$, that\'s still for some men 400$ a month, which is 10 pills, or if they wanted a full 30 days supply it\'d be 1200$. Insurance also hardly covers any of that, maybe covering 10% of the patient is lucky. The generic equivalent isnt much better, maybe costing 35$ a pill instead of 40-50$.\n\nMost of the problem actually comes from pharma companies charging outrageous prices for their products. Although pharmacies to mark up prices to make profit, on most drugs the markup isnt entirely outrageous (although dont get me wrong, some of them ARE outrageous). But typically the markup is 10-25% at most, meaning that those high prices are mostly due to pharma companies charging sometimes hundreds of dollars per pill (some AIDS-related medication can cost insane amounts of money).\n\nI hope that prices come down, for the sake of patients I sell prescriptions to every day. I think the worst thing for me is to tell an older patient that their prescription is 100$ more than it was last month, simply because their med D coverage is in "the donut hole" or "the coverage gap," meaning at that stage in their insurance, the insurance company jacks up prices every month until they meet some sort of "magic" number, in which afterwards most medications will be free or near-free. Well, this is until the year starts again, in which case they have to go through it all over.\n\nThis wouldn\'t be so much of an issue if instead of their life-saving prescriptions costing 600$ per month, they only cost 100$ or even less. And when you\'ve got an older patient with 5 or 6 prescriptions, and their in the donut hole, they could easily be spending upwards of 1000$ per month on prescriptions, even AFTER insurance.\n\nWe need more pharmaceutical companies that produce more competition, and aren\'t in cahoots with each other and the insurance companies.', 'superswaglord1945': 'ORANGE MAN BAD', 'J Hitchcock': "The death might be permanent?

For this reason drug companies almost universally drop the regular brand drug as soon as it goes generic, but they have tricks for this where they combine that drug with another drug that is typically given to the same patients, or they change the formula for the pill to make it release slower or something that makes it significantly different than the original in order to make a new patent, and they hope the brand name recognition will get patients to ask for the new one.'}{'Tom Smith': 'The first good thing Donald Drumpf has done !!', 'zach123101': "1:08 permanent death that's the worst kind", 'TBSE Gabriel': '300 billion of that was sold on the streets and became illegal drugs.', 'Orien Louttit': "Wouldn't it just be easier to ban drug advertising on TV?

Presumably, the effects of the drug are not like the effects of skittles, and are simply a marketing gimmick.  Most people expect drugs to do things, but the average consumer probably couldn't tell you what that drug does.

The only thing in my way is that it has a fucking insane price tag. Luckily my family's insurance covers it, but only after I've not only seen a therapist for a certain amount of time, but if I have record of seeing 3 or more drugs fail to work within my time of treatment and diagnosis. \nAll of that being said, I am currently on a 225mg dose of Effexor, which is over the therapeutic recommended dose. This was because my psychiatrist insisted my depression would react to the boost. Low and behold, it didn't, and now I'm just taking a pill for it's side effects, which are weight gain, lethargy, and a handful of other goodies. If TMS was made more accessible, I could have seen some results way sooner than before I had to boost my medications. I could go on and on about this TMS thing and about it's own side effects (which are very few,) but that is not the point of this comment. \nAs a bit of a topical side track, we are seeing an extreme crisis around opioids. While there are some cases that find a painkiller of that caliber necessary, I honestly think we should be pushing more physical therapy-type treatments to have a lower price tag, if at all possible. I have seen withdrawal effects first hand, as I experience them every time I miss even a single day of my medications. They are painful and usually last a couple days or weeks after the drug is reintroduced. \nTLDR: I just wish we'd push other alternative treatments and avoid prescribing drugs.", 'QuiteDecent': 'Death may become permanent...', 'Jared Burk': "I don't see why this is a bad thing.

The only problem to this being the actual longevity of their stance and if they decide to artificially restrict access to much needed medicines to the general public; creating national headlines at the least detrimental, to the most detrimental being a public outcry which is denied by an absurdly difficult pay wall to overcome as more and more pharmaceuticals are developed to combat more and more diseases and disorders. This creating an artificial means of hyper-inflated prices which would fall down a slippery slope of general inaccessibility to anything that isn't OTC.\n\nAnother way being, if they became completely transparent with pricing options to the general public. This could result in more general awareness of what you're getting, but it could create a gray area of over-accessibility. This could result in a lot more people being prescribed substances that have a threat of developing a dependency, being subject to a misdiagnosis, or an overdose of yet another easily accessible substance due to people seeing what they're getting and going through the process to get it in any way they legally can.\n\nAnother bump in the road is to factor in things like AARP Medical Coverage, or even the concept of having medical insurance to begin with. These institutions do the research on price points and even offer discounts based upon their unique tier systems. Some would argue that this method offers a safer alternative to accessing medicines that could prolong or save your life but at the cost of a higher premium for using their service. It could, hypothetically, render most of those job opportunities obsolete and give that responsibility to the general public who is generally uninformed of most options that they have at their disposal.\n\nIn short, there's an unintended, yet foreseeable consequence to either standpoint. My opinion, create a regulated system of obtaining and researching different medications through either an organized effort like a website that can only be accessed through ID numbers given to you from your chart at the doctor's office, or create an equally regulated system of cycling name brand medicines that have only recently been developed with other brands that have garnered consistent results into an accessible OTC form. The newer ones are only accessible through prescription at a medical facility, and the reliable older ones are cycled to the public at an accessible price point that is not only visible, but comparable to promote healthy, yet regulated competition.", 'Mumen Rider': 'Think of this tactic as a way to get more money dumped into the election cycle,  a lot of hype and noise now, but once the money rolls in, this proposal will die.', 'shmebulock': 'Maybe unpopular opinion but hear me out.

Marketing is a powerful tool and if too many new drugs fail to get off the ground because of their perceived high initial cost, we could be in big trouble. \n\nGetting any drug through the drug testing process costs hundreds of millions, if not billions, per drug. And that does not include all the investments made on formulas that failed out of the testing process part way through. \n\nIf a patient sees an ad for an expensive new drug they may be deterred and not listen to their doctor when they say the old cheaper drug is less effective, has less side effects, etc. opting to continue with an older cheaper drug. This situation could easily turn into consumers sticking with tried and true drugs, ignoring new products, and bankrupting companies that spent billions on drug research. Why would pharma companies risk making new drugs when they can just market their old drugs that have made back their investment and increase profit margins? \n\nI‚Äôm not saying consumers should not be informed how much a drug is going to cost them, but it is a bit naive to think a patient who sees a commercial for an old drug being sold for $50 a month will switch to a new more effective drug that costs $200 a month just because their doctors recommend them too.

One of the things I have to battle the most is insurance NOT  the pharmaceutical companies.  (If you really want to know why I actually love pharmaceutical companies all probably reply in the comments below) The insurance companies actually have set different prices for the meds , I found the same company offering to cover my prescriptions saying it cost them 4 different prices then AFTER the discount was giving it made it look like better differences  for them. ( I have pictures to prove that hell I went through in 2015). This would make the price locked in so the insurance company would have to completely honor the coverage they say they give you, it is not the same now. \n\nI also feel people would be less likely to go get on a new drug without doing more research on it. Already most meds when you go to use fill the prescription for the first time any where between 1dose/1 month to at least a year you can get help covering it from the company that makes it. Either go to their website  or call and they can walk you through what it will take to get help.

You either have side effects or you don't and if you notice you body being strangely different for a decent amount of time ( depending on the problem) ,medicine or not you should be contacting you doctor. \n\nAnother thing that would really help us as humans is to slow down on the Over the Counter meds. Talking to your doctor first you can often find that changing what you consume or something added/changed/ taken away from your routine can help more than OtCs can.\n\n I think once people start seeing true prices, doing more research that is helpful with the information that is coming from a direct source and trusting in their doctors (key to trusting doctors is to first find one that doesn't want to shove more meds at you) can really help everyone over all.  \n\nI think the changes listed are a great start and over time we can work to get people in office to help fine tune them.", 'elzeus13': 'Expand it beyond TV', 'kayla Barnes': '1.

Think about that for a second....lobbyist were originally created as a go between for citizens to reach out to their representatives.  Instead of a Congress person or Senator receiving hundreds of phone calls directly in regards to the same issue, the lobbyist would receive those calls, compile issues that were most important and then present them at one meeting.  Originally, lobbyist's salaries were paid for by the members of Congress or the Senate who wanted to utilize their services, but thankfully big businesses stepped in and offered to cover the cost of those salaries. That happened in the early eighties, anyone else remember what happened then?  That's when Reagan was introduced to the idea of the trickle down theory.  Yup lobbyist, that were hired by big businesses, gave the idea to our representatives that if large cooperation's were to get large tax cuts they could then share their profits to their employees like smaller mom and pa stores did.  Notice I said they COULD, not would have to....that was never a law.  So even though they could, and especially since they SHOULD our larger companies took advantage of those tax breaks and kept all the money as profit for themselves and their share holders.  This is why their aren't any more ma and pa electronics stores, or clothing stores, or vacuum store, Walmart put them out of business.  Large pharmacy chains like CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid put all the local pharmacy's out of business and that is why price gouging is happening now.  These stores have the money to order drugs at such a high price, and since insurance companies will reimburse and customers will pay those costs their is no down side.  BTW most of the medications you are prescribed are unnecessary if  your doctor would research natural ways to heal, such as a chiropractor instead of a spinal fusion, or eating healthy to keep weight down and finally stretching every day is a great way to reduce injury to your joints therefore needing less pain killers...wouldn't that be good to stop the opiod problem we have.  All of this is known outside the US but here we are so concerned with a free market that we literally make people sick just to sell them harmful drugs.  Wow there is so much more I can say, but I'll leave you with this, do your research.  What you are being told is not the truth. Uninsured patients were not causing a money drain on insurance companies.  Doctors were not double billing on patients that had insurance, they can't the way their contracts are set up with the insurance.  This was another lobbyist group trying to confuse us citizens and convince our representatives to pass laws that FORCED us to buy their product.

In response to losing their patent on their drug and a generic being formulated, the price of epipen skyrocketed. Is this because pharmacy companies think of the good of the people? Definitely not.

Companies and the government usually put out annually updated formularies for covered meds, but those aren\'t always accurate and aren\'t always easy to access.

Not wholesalers, not pharmacies, and certainly not patients. There are a lot of contracts in place that negotiate different prices between manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies.

They are the still on patent and a generic/biosimilar cannot be produced until that patent expires. You can‚Äôt post a price of a competitor if competitors don‚Äôt exist. \n\nThat‚Äôs all I got.
