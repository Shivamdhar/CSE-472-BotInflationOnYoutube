Eliyah Thurman	The Shot Dennis Smith hit was no doubt tough but it was a bad shot selection and let’s be honest he pushed off, good defense by DRose, and in my opinion as a ref you got to let this play be a no call or an offensive foul for the extension of the right forearm instead of bailing DSJ out with the foul because then if he would’ve missed the shot that’s still potential 2 points in a really close game. 😪
