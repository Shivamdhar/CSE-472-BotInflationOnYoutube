First of all, these European Christians killed millions of aboriginal people and colonized their land. After stealing the land, these same Christians enslaved a nation of negro people for 400 years and supervised their captivity. They introduced the slave to their European Messiah and their Christian doctrine. Secondly, they enforced illiteracy upon the negro man to prevent self identity and the true knowledge of their God (Most High). I often wonder if there is a correlation between the true Messiah being hung in a tree and the hanging of negros. They wrote in their constitution that the negros are 3/5 of a man. What true man of God (Most High) would portray a human this way? They denied the negro man and woman basic human rights. The European nation of Christians worked the negro slave from sun-up to sun- down without pay, gave them ungodly foods, and conditioned them to live in poor living conditions. Taught the negro man to become a whoremonger  to produce a stronger slave-man to sell. These Europeans Christians also rape women, men and children and called themselves the children of god. I still ask the question, which god? Oh, by the way, Satan is a god too. This nation of European Christians or godly people used the negro child as gator bait, how godly is this action? This is truly the new Egypt and this Pharaoh is more ruthless than the first, although similar. These Christians continue to show who they are with a continued onslaught of the negro man, with countless murders by their Christian police force and citizens. This European or Caucasian Christian doctrine is not for those of you who truly believe in the Most High and the true Messiah, if you want to survive what‚Äôs about to happen, come out of her. This is proof that the earth is given into the hands of the wicked. The European/Caucasian Christians doesn‚Äôt understand that what ever a man reap, he will also sew. If you think that the true GOD (Most High) is going to allow you to get away with vile violations of his word, you got another thing coming. ‚ÄúPrepare slaughter for his children for the iniquities of their fathers‚Äù. What ever you put into the universe prepare to get double, because the Most High doesn‚Äôt like how harshly you dealt with his people. Furthermore,  the negros that perpetuate these beliefs in the community will die with her in the last days, because you partake in her SINS. By the way, Easu ‚ÄúIS NOT‚Äù the Caucasian or White man.

And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)"(Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to "fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you" leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families. The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries. In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did). Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah\'s rule (ie. Muslim conquest). The use of the word "persecution" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna. Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation. A strict translation is \'sedition,\' meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah). This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned "until religion is for Allah" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief. [ Verse 193 plainly says that \'fighting\' is sanctioned even if the fitna \'ceases\'. This is about religious order, not real persecution.]\n\nQuran (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things." \n\nQuran (2:216) - "Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not." Not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time. From the Hadith, we know that this verse was narrated at a time that Muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot.\n\nQuran (3:56) - "As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help."\n\nQuran (3:151) - "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority". This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be \'joining companions to Allah\').\n\nQuran (4:74) - "Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward." The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, who were led meekly to the slaughter. These Muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah. This is the theological basis for today\'s suicide bombers.\n\nQuran (4:76) - "Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah‚Ä¶"\n\nQuran (4:89) - "They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."\n\nQuran (4:95) - "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home).Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward " This passage criticizes "peaceful" Muslims who do not join in the violence, letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah\'s eyes. It also demolishes the modern myth that "Jihad" doesn\'t mean holy war in the Quran, but rather a spiritual struggle. Not only is this Arabic word (mujahiduna) used in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption. (The Hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man\'s protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad, which would not make sense if it meant an internal struggle).\n\nQuran (4:104) - "And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain..." Is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense?\n\nQuran (5:33) - "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"\n\nQuran (8:12) - "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle. The targets of violence are "those who disbelieve" - further defined in the next verse (13) as "defy and disobey Allah." Nothing is said about self-defense. In fact, the verses in sura 8 were narrated shortly after a battle provoked by Muhammad, who had been trying to attack a lightly-armed caravan to steal goods belonging to other people.\n......................................wake up people ......', 'Jonathan': 'Democrats will become a thing of the past, time to turn this country around!

We pay 59.3 cents tax on every gallon of gasoline. Our state has a  74 billion dollar unfunded pension fund liability. Our government is looking to raise taxes even more to try to close this gap. Most of the pension fund liability is for liberal university professors. Some of them will and are receiving as much as 600 thousand dollars a year in retirement. The famous Jerry Sandusky of Penn state university a convicted child molester won a decision in court to continue to receive 59000 dollars a year  pension payment. Our roads have fallen apart Pennsylvania department of transportation is more concerned with there pay and pension fund then fixing our roads the whole system is corrupt.
