Natasha Ashley	Anybody else think that when she burned she looked like a child
cute brock	omg- as soon as you burned it smoke came straight out of its eyes it looked so creepy, but i didnt get scared at alllll..lmao. but also stay safe jake! i also recommend you to cleanse yourself and maybe tell colby and sam to do so too. <3
ArtistGamerLady	Sorry this is late but does anyone else know that half of the time the camera is blurry??
Mayonnaise	*I’m a sick fuck I like a quick fuck*
Maria Cardoso	"I don't give a rats toot" lmao! Luv u Jake!, 0:52
Amber Kelley	207 is maine....
Scarlett sapphire	When you burn a doll that someone asks you to take care of you shouldn’t just burn it especially if she might have a soul trapped inside at least get the whole backstory of it smh
XxGalaxy_GamerxX Wolf	She was smiling before Colby threw her in the fire
Ellie Stokes	2:29 wtf is that in da backround 😅

fatima muhammad	at 4:41 her eyes adjust from small to big
Penelope Costa	Did you see the dolls eyes move
Keeta Honner	You should do a video and see if it moves
**Connecting_ With_Spirit*	This is the dumbest thing you could have ever done.  You could have just sold it on Ebay and found an owner that would appreciate the paranormal.  You guys are so disrespectful. I hope she contains a demon or a vengeful spirit to haunt your dumb asses.  That way you learn your lesson and respect the unknown.
claudia Smith	I broke a haunted doll before and the thing inside it never leaves me alone.
Guru	i feel kinda sad for the doll
Piano Keyboard Girl	You made a mistake.
Anita Marie Castillos	Lol when colby really needs some(AKA: Its a jokeokay)
ItsYaBoiJosh	Yo what if the lady was being haunted by the doll while the doll was with her so she sold it but somehow the doll told her that if she harms it in any way then the doll spirit from the doll would come after her and that's why she kept asking Reggie it was okay
Erika Graves	At 7:52 there is a little hand in the top right corner of the fire pit. And I remember seeing that little hand when Jake opened the dybuk box with Sam and Colby.
Magge y	why do keep calling the clearly PINK eyes orange?
OofMelia	I think colby has been secretly dating the doll 😂
Arianna Perez	Bro @ 7:11 the doll burning looks like an upside down cross😱 wtf...
Madison Newby	thats creepy i love it jake stop with the demons and dolls jeebus i want u to stay alive and not get killed by demons....
Catelyn Rosenquist	I got extremely natious while watching this video, specifically after she was burned. I haven't felt bad or anything all day. Maybe a coincidence, but I don't knoooooow
Cupcake Party	🎵 *I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED BUT I DONT REALLY CARE, SO FUCK THIS SHIT IM OUT* 🎵
the joker	Don't burn objects that hold entities because you'll release the spirit
Ky Sun	Let  it burn let it burn
Evie Harris	Its facial expressions really did change throughout the whole process..
Anna K	I saw her eyes throbing at one point
Caitlyn Jameyson	I got chills. Even tho im behind a screen.
The Weird Phan	WELP WE LOVED YOU BYE
lancelyn barbee	You should've burned the doll all the way so that the spirit leaves. And burn sage after.
• f a l l i n g b e a n •	why would you burn your child lmao
Diana Wola	There’s a museum that takes in hunted item in America and keeps them in good condition and the spirits calm so bad spirits can’t harm anyone that’s where the original Anabell rests
Glory Sage	Burn the rest of her!
Maddy Castillo	omg play it sow starting at 9:39 and the hand MOVES
Caridee Bollinger	4:48
The Broken Ones	Burning it only sets the spirit free. You've done nothing but worsen your situation.
Grace Ronan	I was washing my face in the bathroom with the door closed and then the door was slowly creaking open it scared the crap out of me
Miriam Ramos	How do you sleep at night
Elyssa Cranford	Jake you keep dodging alot of bullets with this stuff.. Please be careful
hannah pleming	imagine if they just sent a photo of the doll on fire and all burnt with no context to that weirdo lady who was the old owner
Enchanted Squid	When you started to burn it I started to feel emotional
Allison Goodwin	4:41 watch the dolls eyes, they zoom in and out!
Raven Maniates	Why am I crying? Like literally I started crying. And when Sam poured the water on the head and the flame blew up I started bawling. Also, you need to burn the left over arm because the object a spirit is connected to has to be burned all the way to send the spirit away. Weather it's up or down.
Starr Animations!	I wish y’all did a lot of scary videos more often
Cadence M	*-h o l y  f u c k-*
Bäby. girl_Gen	When Colby was humping the doll...and the way he was laughing and smiling is the cutest thing ever 😍
Crazy Robz Vlogs	0:06 is my current mood
Ali Coulter	Yeah I’m kinda late on this but I don’t care. I think that burning a haunted doll, or any doll for that matter isn’t safe. The person who told you to keep it safe is probably just messing with you. If it is true then so be it. I believe in the supernatural but there’s an extent that goes with it. I’ve always believed that it’s not just the houses that are haunted it’s the people inside them. Talking from witnessing it myself seeing something that not everyone should see is scary. I have had many encounters with the supernatural and let me tell you. Shit gets real okay. I’m only 16 and usually after the age of 8 to 10 you would grow out of a phase where you don’t have an imaginary friend or seeing a ‘ghost’/spirit. I have watched many shows where people think there’s a doll or house that is haunted but that’s not always the case. Take it from someone who had gone through something that you shouldn’t mess around with this stuff weather it’s true or not. Along with the ouiji boards. There is a certain way to use them. As I use the word ‘them’. They are not toys and they are nOt to make jokes of. They are very dangerous if you don’t use them right. I appreciate all your video tho Jake and hope you don’t do that kind of thing again. I would block that number and make sure it can’t call you again and please be safe.  ~Alisøn
Wild WolfGamer	I think angelica was looking into my soul, I started sneezing not even half a second, after y’all faced her towards the camera, every tome
Lisa Anderson	OMG jake your such an idoit what if you let out a spirit with bad intentions please stay safe jake  Please like if you agree
Richland Williams	Sam:shuts the door loud Jake:you gonna make me mess up my pants dude😂😂 Colby:smacking the doll butt🤦🏽😂
Angelica Givens	I hate how it’s name is my name 😂😭
Caitlin :/	i really wanna know what the name of that purple hair dye is🤣
Jolie Iler	Bro... burning things that are possessed or spooky sets whatever's in it free. You gotta bury or sell that crap
T.S. Leigh	Jake.... I'm worried about you now. I am. I sincerely hope nothing bad happens to you and the roommates. On another note, the entire video when I looked into the doll's eyes, I felt like something was staring AT ME through that doll. Those eyes were too creepy, man >.<!
Julia Zoladz	I’m watching this at night.Great i’m gonna have nightmares tonight
Angie gg	It's eyes are pink.... poor thing. U guys r so mean n disrespectful
Mathius Strong	Did anyone see the pupils get smaller at 4:45?
Madisonbishop	Zorgo diffuse 9:57pm
Julianna	Am I color blind? Bc they keep saying that her eyes are orange but I thought they were pink. Someone helppp. Lmao
Perla Garcia	Yall need sum holy water from a church
Evil_King_922	4:40, I Swear as soon as he said something about the dolls eyes, her pupils dilated. They like got bigger and then shrunk again.
Liberty Borlandelli	Have colby cleanse the house with that plant he bought off line the one he cleansed his room with I forgot the name but it helps get all the bad Spirits out
Alyssa Agbayani	4:40 i thought i saw its pupils dilating
ANDz_VH	I always wonder.. Is jake really this stupid in rl or he's just being stupid for youtube
-未知の unknown	jake. i'm studying wicca and i need you to know that this was the worst idea you could've had. the spirit of the girl whom died is trapped inside of the doll. you didn't burn the doll to ashes which means that the spirit is still attached to the doll! the reason why the fire was enlarging was due to the spirit telling you not to mess with it anymore. the calls you were getting were obviously from the woman who owned the doll, and you're going to get a call or see her again soon and she will instantly know what happened to the doll. you wonder why your house is fucking haunted! ://
Alison Drake	When the Head of the doll started turning itself on fire I thought it was a bomb that was gonna explode, I got scared😅
jayjay2007 fortnite and more	U don FUCKED up
Chemicalpanic!piløts	hey! I'm not all the way through the video yet so there might be some information I missed, but here's my theory to the texts so far:  I believe that the woman who sold it may have lost a child (possibly lost to suicide hence the slit wrist??) or a young relative and believed that the child's spirit resides in the doll. That could possibly explain the text where she tells Jake to care for it "like his own" because mabey the spirit in the doll *was* her child or relative at one point? That could also give an explanation as to why she didn't want to destroy it because she might have felt that she was holding onto the reminents of whatever may reside in the doll and instead sells it to someone she believes will take good care of it.   I know it's a stretch but it's just what I got out of it! Plz like so Jake might see it lol
courtney hutton	I don't know why but I feel really bad for this doll like honestly while I was watching jake poor the fuel on her I actually felt like I was gonna cry. Did anybody else feel that way watching this?
JoyofLaila	As soon as Jake’s phone started ringing the second time my phone started ringing
Goosebumps Dolan	she gonna come back and haunt yo ass you need a priest and some holy water ✝️
Marissa Rose	Yeooooo that’s fucking crazy
Visual Effects	"I don't give a rat's toot" - Jake 2018   That made this entire video
Hunter Draws	Okay this was kinda bad idea since she is actually haunted the dolls spirit is free but it is now stuck in ur home so she is still with u no madder what
Ashley Blasingame	The spirit comes out of the doll when you set it on fire
Hopeful Brock	When they where putting it out the hand moved
ţhë đæý	Is it just me that covered my screen while jake focusing that burnt doll. Its creepy. Btw poor doll. I think you should not burnt it. Or just give it to someone can handle that thing.
Mick Roberson	As I was watching my lights flickers every time it showed her face
Jess W	i dare you to tell the recent owner you burned it👀
Abigail Mustain	Oml, dude, please don’t die.
Appieabshire1969	i would of burned the doll as soon as somthing happend `
Erica Etherington	She was murdered
Hayley Keefe	Instead of burning it, you should’ve yeeted that bitch into someone’s backyard
Emily Shearer	When they burn shit they should really put a circle if salt so whatever is in the doll stays in that circle
Bailey Hardy	9:40 i kid you not, when he pours water onto her again, the arm that wasnt burnt moves. It like twitches in agony almost.
Lilly scissor hands	This is creepy Af
Kara Holt	Ugh as I was watching this I had chills going down my spine and felt like someone was watching me. Honestly I think my house is haunted because a few days ago when I got home I walked in my room and saw a doll bed laying perfectly in the center of my bed, and the bed was originaly on the floor for my cat
Alyssa Rivera	Did anyone see at the end a bubble come out of the dolls mouth? And the FUCKING EYES WERE MOVING!!!!
Laila Cates	OMG at the end when you were zooming into the dolls face and then the outro that scared the living sh*t out of me
Darleen Nunez	The arm that wasn't burned moved back and forth
Shelby Faith	you guys are burning in hell for sure... 🤣🤣
KING JULIE	U should have never burn that doll... n u didn’t finish burning it.... not good
Itsss Allyyy	i jumped like 10 times. I SWEAR I SAW SOMETHING CRAWL OUT OF MY BATHTUB
queen caramel	call the lady and tell her u burned angelica
Aubrie B.	You guys should have salted the doll before setting it on fire... now the spirit could be vengeful and could easily attach itself to you guys... please stay safe❤️❤️
Krista Borrelli	Angelica Schuyler for Hamilton
Santa Muerte	you shoulda send it to me, i woulda want it
Miranda Barranco	why the hell would you burn it if the person who owned it before made it very clear not to hurt it, aND with the fact that it's haunted-
Tamera Legaspi	dude i literally got goosebumps while watching this.. that i haunted for sure.
Canyon_Wolf	Have you told the lady you burned it?
niharika :D	Omggg what if that lady was attached with this doll and only the dolls hand was left unburned maybe that lady's too .... She called u .. She wasnt able to speak anything... As her whole body was burnt...?!?!?!?!?!?
Ali Pynenberg	U just fucked up ppl u might of released something that should NOT have been released 🤦🏽‍♀️
marszhii dayz	WTFFF 4:40 pupil moved OMFG
Bella Suiters	I kinda want the  part of the doll that didn't  burn
EDWARD CHOE	wondering why you look so cute Jake! ;) Btw does violet sound better than pink?
Cat Noir	P.s you guys didn't get ride of her, when you burned her she was removed from the doll and freely wondering around your house at the moment, Because when you burn something Jake,Sam and Colby it only release it from were it was trapped in know she is free to do as she wishes soooooo Be careful and don't let that doll scratch you hot bodies k lol.
bella	colby needs a girlfriend.
Corey Cunningham	Bad idea number 3,954: Burning a haunted doll
Grumpy Cat	Colby is so lonely. It's sad. Colby, everyone loves you❤
Averee Cama03	This was a bad idea jake     Well that was obvious
Moon Child	Why do u keep burning possessed objects, that's the last thing u wanna do unless u wanna set the spirit free and have it haunt u 😭
tammy tidwell	Why did u burn her I would have Tooken her
Jacobi Kroeskamp	Jeez...😮😮😮
Topaz Tera	Okay, I'm kind of mixed on if it was a good idea to burn her. On one hand, the spirit could be mad you burned the doll and probably start haunting your house. But on the other hand, I used a few tools I have and found out the spirit could be happy you did it. In Colby's video, it said there was no way of setting it free but burning an object of attachment can release a spirit that has a connection with it.
DG	has anyone else noticed that her eyes glitch sometimes? I thought it was my computer but ONLY her eyes look they're vibrating for like a sec, 5:42 when Jake said "yeah do it"  idk i found it weird
Kylie Ferrara	colby is literally all guys in no nut november in this video lmaooo
Kaylerz	Can you imagine spending the day with Jake ? It would be Non stop laughing lol
Sheree Luker	my phone just got called by a random number:(((((
A Clark	OMG that last part was so fricking scary with the water and everything else
carlogamingplays	Jake why are u burning it I almost cried and u shouldn't have burnt it cause i have been discussing this with my friends and we think that it's spirit will slit ur wrist to kill u
Alexandra Hernandez	I know I’m late but if you would of took a picture of the  fire you could see a face
JESSICA MACK	Not to scar you guys but at    the end of the video when you went dack to finish the video i could see the doll  coming back to life did you see her  legs at the end of the video 😬
Emmalea Leonard	Jake why would you do that, you needed to wait until she told you what was going on with the doll and why to keep it safe the doll was probably dangerous or the soul trapped inside thats probably the reason she wanted it to be safe so it didn't harm anyone or THE REASON WHY IT WAS TRAPPED INSIDE A DOLL!!!! ( you need to tell the lady so she can tell you what to do)       ⛔ Disclaimer: I'm not trying to be mean to Jake, Sam, or Colby I just want them to be safe❤
Kristaps Jānis Dzirnieks	at 4.44 the dolls eyes?!
TheAwkwardOwl	Oh my cheese and crackers it does look like her facial expression changed look at 3:19 then look at 6:12
Aida Camille	You shouldn't have done that
Destiny Burgess	It's not just u it looks mad as hell
Emma Davis	The reason why the cut was the only thing on its body that didn’t get burnt was probably where the demon entered .
kitten stuffies	Jake don't die
Madison Cox	Don’t really listen to the lady that sold her. She seems like she just wants to be likeomygoshitsrealfreakoutright. She is creepy but I bet she’s just making a story
The Tea	There needs to be a compilation of jake burning anything that’s possessed
taleiyah taylorr	4:00 really colby
Biker girl vlogs	I would have taken her and added her to my collection
Piper G	so during the first minute of the video my phone messes up and turns off. It’s probably just my phone being a bitch but it’s still creepy 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
LuluGirl Yeea	You need to put salt on the things you burn
Morgan Eliza	Don't you know by now that burning haunted things is a bad idea, Jake? You should have given her to me. I would've protected her.
Sylas	Why do you guys insist on releasing spirits rather than actually getting rid of them
Lillie Ellis	Y dose it look like a body
Kenny Lemon	I hate that doll good thing you burnt it 👌😰🔥
Emily Sturge	You guys are so childish, I love it😂
Paloma Ceja	They should of gave it to graveyardgirl 😂
Blue Rocker girl	Jake Webber you have brought hell upon yourself and your roommates, be prepare for what's to come jake..... Because of your not then kiss your life and those around you goodbye.... Goodbye Jake Webber for this maybe the last time we talk.
Meralyn Brimer	He said 50 thousand likes and he held up 30. What sense does that make? But your audio screwed up shortly after you lit it on fire. And I'm pretty sure that the piping noise was a warning of bad things are going to happen. But I don't know
breathingformikey	wait, weren't her eyes blue before?
Wolf Girl	Creepy ass doll.
Jayden Cey	Oh my lord. How are you guys still alive like wtf😂🖤✖️🖤
Vonn Mi Boi	go to 4:38-4:44 and look at her right eye, but slow it down to 0.25. It looks like her eyes are adjusting to the light
Emma Anctl	Go back and watch right before the video ends and look in the dolls right eye
LeonistaDXVida	Speechless hope you guys are doing fine!! That was scary AF!!!!
LavenEclipse	This is really disrespectful. The spirit was prob not dangerous its common ppl ask to care for a doll as a real person. It makes me really sad you did this spirit doesn't always chose the doll or object it connects too. Yall have done stupid shit already tho so I doubt you even care. I honestly stuck thru most of the shenanigans but this made me to sick to even watch you anymore.... even if its a joke putting this out there only will create ignorance.
Alaina Hanley	Imagine if the doll came back and was sitting on ur couch at 3 am, well i would just die flat out right there☠️
jasmijn	Well, this is definitely living beyond the norm am I right? 😂
Bree playz	You should tell the person who sold it that you burned it and see what she says.
Daddy Pig	11:04 fifty thousand likes  *holds up 3*
Seiara Suiters	“I have the receipt sis”
Kaela Nicole Paisley	Now we need an update video on the aftermath of this incident.... did you ever figure out who called you?
Fatima Mohamed	Jake you are clearly calling troubles yourself
Hannah Guerette	I own dolls like that but I think it's the doll is calling you like my dolls call !e all the time
Laila Barker	omg, omg, omg, OMG!!! *i feel like angelika (srry if thats not how it's spelled) has come through my screen to haunt my house even more than it is, i summoned a demon, maybe, kinda, no..yeah i did..*
Hadyn Morrow	*READS TITLE* WHY WAS IT EVER A GOOD IDEA!?
Olivia Kiocho	Welp I'm happy I'm watching this in the morning not night. 😅😂
Crystalized Mari	Jake watch the Video at 4:40 when you zoom in on the Doll because her Pupils are moving like on a Person when there is light ore it´s getting darker
Alexie Ramirez	I know I'm really late but what if it was something telling u to let the doll burn when they were calling u every tune u tried to put the fire out
Azie B	Did the dolls mouth open......... I love how Sam and Colby aren’t taking this serious
skyler269	Oh, my God. It's not the doll that is the problem. It's the entity inside the doll. If you burn the doll, which is not the direct problem, you're only going to be releasing the entity and that entity is going to be pissed that you burned it's house down and it's going to be looking for a new vessel. You should have put it in a case with special protected glass and sealed it. Let it watch, but it can't do anything about it. That way everyone's happy.  I don't mean to sound like a know-it-all, but I work with this kind of thing with my mom all the time and I want to keep you guys safe any way I can because your guys' videos keep me safe every day
Alaina Clymens	JAKE STOP BURNING CRAP
Emma Casey	THE NUMBER THAT CALLED YOU IS FROM MAINE😱 THE CREEPY PART IS, IS THAT I LIVE IN MAINE!?
My Yellow Jumpsuit Blood	When an haunted object is "hot" that means there is some weird ass energy in that object. When I feel haunted dolls at like savers or something, the weird burning energy lingers in my arm and it's freaky.. Like, ik the doll was evil but like, it looked like you where burning a real person and that kinda freaked me out 😝
Mary Abernathy	The zoom at the end then the outro made me jump xD
Angelica Star	Dude my name is Angelica. I'm scared now xD
Creeper Girl	Last haunted video, yeah VIDEO not life, dude text that girl who sold your brother that doll what would happen if something bad happens to her and if it doesnt look pretty than I suggest that you get a  priest inside and look around the fire pit or house, to be honest you should have returned it to the owner and not to  burn it.
Matt Man	RIP MF's.
Ayanna Bennett	Bruh STOP BURNING CREEPY AND POSSIBLY POSSESSED SH*T U ONLY MAKE IT WORSE!!!!!
Grand Modz	Nice!
Kimberly Cervantes	why didn’t you try recording her
TheMythCraft	FUCK, WHY WOULD YOU GUYS DO THAT?! DON'T YOU KNOW NOT TO BURN THE SUPERNATURAL UNLESS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO?! DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?!
Izzy1oo	I always like it before it starts for you☺️❤️
john jamon	If it's really haunted, if there's really something or someone inside that doll it will haunt all of you. What you say, what you did before and after you burn her will definitely have consequences. Cleanse the house, cleanse youselves but It.Will.Remain! for you have inflicted enough reasons for it to stay.   "Hell halth no fury like a woman scorned"   What ever was in there, inside that doll has been set free. And the once a spirit or entity has been set free it attaches itself to those who freed it. Or to where it was set free.
crazy Ladys	*rats tude*
WolfieOreO	4:50 love the song Jake xD
Stephany Albanil	Jake why the fuck would you burn it?!?!?!😬
Milita Askr	Yeah uh jake you gon croak
Hanako Hikaru	YOUR BURNING IT??? JAKE NOOO YOUR SUPPOSE TO BE BURYING IT THATS THE ONLY WAY IT WON'T HAUNT YOU
Danielle Sunga	Ughhh why do you keep zooming her face 🙄🙄
Nolan Dolan	I’m watching this at 10 pm  And I’m so paranoid rn
Nikhil Prakash	Hey jake do a cheating prank on sam...😉😉
Amber Rose	50 thousand likes, He puts up 3 fingers and a 0 isn't that 30 thousand likes there😂😂😂
Animation with Cyberwolf9999	The doll looks like the pupils move like bigger and smaller is freaking horrifying
Wackystallion2328	NO WAY, AT 4:40 THE PUPILS OF THE EYES ARE GETTING SMALLER AND THEN BIGGER, SMALLER THEN BIGGER
jacinta brook	Says 50,000 likes and holds up 3 fingers
danya blankenship	Rather bazar boys, I think you might have made a big mistake!!!!!! More scary videos please ; )
Seraph Kizuna 17	*Update* y'all better not sleep, lock your doors and probably sleep in one room. Cuz the way it ignited steam from the head and eyes, it's the sign of bad luck coming to you all. Try to never burn anything haunted.  PS: if the call number is unavailable, the chances are, it's the doll spirit
Artsy Witch	Don't ever burn anything that's Haunted because  it will set it free and it will either go back to where it came from or attach itself to you
PasteelPetal 101	7:52 look at Angelica’s burnt hand that is not Sams hand for sure!!!!
Sarah Michaela	Tbh, burning the doll was kinda rude. Because that lady clearly and obvi deeply cared about the doll. And yeah, I rly like these scary vids but now, they just clearly doing em for the views
WolfzieDraws	I feel a little bad, regardless of your belief in ghosts or whatever, that was a really cool doll that clearly had some time put into it, and it's probably fairly old
Summer Boston	That doll gives me the frikin creeps and I’m watching on Halloween
Isabella McGarry	I swear I saw the dolls eyes move or I’m just creeped by that doll
allanah the yeemo rat	love catching up on the roommates haunted videos ON HALLOWEEN
Awkward Pixie	im actually terrified for you guys
HighPriestKadaj	why does jake always result in burning things that r haunted lol
Ann Entad	Poor Angelica... The owner will be so mad. If you really felt that it is haunted you should have put or sprinkle salt in it and expose it to sunlight for a whole day so the entity thats within it will vanish...
Sarah Leibenguth	Jake-“How is it burning that much” Me- uh maybe cause you just poured a shit ton of lighter fluid on it 🤦‍♀️
Garrett Thompson	Y’all are crazy!
The Magical Puppy	Honestly she looks really cool i wish i had a doll like that
kbizzle s	Bruh did u know spirts can contact you through ur phone as Unknown!!! So when sam would put the water on it i think she was calling you and thats y there was no one their cuz u couldnt hear anything
Cloey Lorene	9:18 and more is creepy asf
Kawaii Elephant	Wow Jake, what👏 a 👏great 👏thing 👏to 👏do 👏what if the owner of Angelica finds out...... Here’s a challenge for you all: In the replies of this comment paste what you last copied.
Eli TheAuthor	You guys know if you burn something with a spirit connected to it just releases it's soul right? That can make the situation like a hundred times worse.
BROLBY, TFIL whatever im with them for life	11:21 it made bubbles i dont know if it was the doll or it was the flames and the that liquid   (forgot what it was called srry)
Zoey Malik	Wait till she shows up in your house and kills you I'm telling you all DO NOT EVER BURN A FUCKING DOLL THE DOLL WILL KILL YOU
Miku The beepo	Under the video there was an ad for the bible.
JinSwims Xxx	Zooming into the nose made me fucking wheeze cuz I was thinking *yeeters is the new hooters*
McKenna Higdon	oh my fuck.. im literally an idiot. Im sitting in the lobby of the biology building at school watching this and the outro music came on and i yelped. a bitch yelped..... fml everyone is staring at me.
Wendiii	Fucking dumbass!!! YOU NEVER BURN HAUNTED SHIT! I'm starting to feel this is a "on purpose" thing with all the times you've experienced bad shit.. I feel like you're just trying to grab views but that's just what I think.
Ally DeNorcey	Oh no what's the owner gonna do if she finds this video
Jessica Andersson	omg jake.. that was so stupid.. xD
Blippity Bloopity-Boo	Jake!! Jakey Jake!! So here's something you should know:  There are reasons you do not burn a Ouija Board. You cannot by any means burn it; breaking it into seven pieces will do the job.
Veronica Bogantes	Should have just burried the doll, burning it only realises whatever is inside.
GHOSTMAN GAMING	6:35 the doll moves
Munasinghe Tiara Jasmine	wrong move y'all now god bless ur souls x
julia x	this is easily the dumbest thing any of you could have ever done. burning any haunted doll is incredibly dangerous in the first place, but it’s a whole other story when it’s a doll containing a spirit that is supposed to be kept safe. that’s double disrespect. be fucking careful guys. this is not good.
Diane Black	I feel so sorry for the doll somehow. Also, by burning her you set the spirit free. Shouldn't have done this. The previous owner's gonna be so pissed. Hell no.
Fanroder On Wattpad and AO3	Imagine that woman having gotten that doll from like, her dead sister or something, which is why he was told to keep it safe, not because it’s really da gerous
Marwa Bakht	I am dead
Abbie Judy	his outro scared me SKKSKS
jordan park	i don’t think they should have burned her. if she was haunted and like they said, maybe the spirit that is attached to it killed herself and that’s why it has a slit wrist, that girl might have been very important to the former owner. and if the spirit wasn’t bad and just attached itself to it, they just burned the only thing it attached itself to. what if it was a good spirit of someone who just took their life but just went into that doll.
Triple_A	I might just be really tired cause it’s midnight but did anyone else get randomly light headed after watching this? 😅 coincidence much
Orina J	4:41 i swear her pupils pulsed, ew no thank youuuuu, if you don't see it put it in slow-motion
Kendall J	Anyone else see the dolls black things in her eyes get smaller at 5:41?........
Kritika Xettri	11:22     There Was A Bubble In Her Mouth And Poped up😱😂
Naome Hashigana	Person : is Angelica ok? is Angelica ok? is Angelica ok? is Angelica ok? is Angelica ok?  Jake : *burns Angelica*  Person : *calls jake*  Jake : . . . . .
Jauniaus Žukauskas	Goddamnit your f**kin outro
Luna Winter	There was another little hand thing at the top right corner of the fire at 7:51 - 7:52 it was only there for a split second this time!!!!!!!! I swear to gosh I am not lying PLEASE tell me someone else saw it too!!!!
MangoPC Gaming	I kid you not when he zoomed in on the doll and then the intro played that made me jump
Neological Gamer	souls are flammable. they can't be killed by fire though just start internally suffering seeking revenge and you clearly harmed something.
Ashlei Herrera	If an object is haunted to release the spirit. You burn it with salt so the spirit goes on the the spiritual world(heaven/hell). Because if shes stuck in the doll she's stuck in the veil ( between physical and spiritual world). But u need to burn it with salt so you don't get haunted. The salt is for the purification.
Impossidle Jackson	That was a creepy video
lucia flores	Burning it is making it worse... STOP BURNING!!!!! Burning isn't going to get rid of a spirit..... It's going to release it..... If that spirit was in that doll for a reason then you should NOT burn it... And DO NOT treat spirits as a joke ESPECIALLY DOLLS.... So the wya you guys were treating the doll will make the spirit EXTREMELY angry which is very bad.
Günther Jadyn	*so have you died yet....or has anything paranormal happened since you burned it?*
K W	You should make an official “we’re gonna die” song
KpopsicleSuga	Jake why are you so stupid (not trying to be mean but dude)
Rwaii Bay	Okay so first off I just found this account. I’m not hating but, the thing inside the doll is connected to it. The person who is very protective of her obviously knows something seriously powerful that’s why you needed to take care of her. Burning her made it worst because the wrist didn’t burn there’s something seriously powerful that happened to the doll. I feel bad because the thing is connected to the doll so you doing “thinks” to the doll, she knows your disrespecting the thing inside of it. They know that she got worried but you still did it. The women that told you to keep her safe knew something is happening if something is calling you.
Bryanna Emery	Jake you just freed the entity that was in that doll... that is a good thing. :)
Creative Potato	Her eyes look pink to me tho...
Mastergamer Shy	Colby is sexually attracted to the doll😂😂😂
thrasherbabe 666	Do a video about her backstory
Bree Ossmann	jake i really.. really feel like this was a mistake. this video made me completely nauseous the whole time the doll was burning i have a really bad feeling about y’all burning the doll. please god be careful..
valentina 15	The first time i watched this istg she had neon pink eyes now I see a magenta
Lissy Dawn	If you die can I go to your funeral?
Sarah Nicole	It takes serious guts or something to burn another haunted object....😂😂🖤
Captain Paws	STOP👏🏼BURNING👏🏼HAUNTED👏🏼THINGS👏🏼
chyanne storrs	I sware I saw it's eyes move
Gaming-Exploring-Vlogs enjoy	If you are burning it it's basically letting the spirit out
Océane Paul	Me: *reads the title* Wtf did we tell about burning possesed/haunted stuff? smh When will you learn?
Ashlyn Dolan Winchester-brock	You really should’ve covered it in salt and then burn it.
Sarah Schneider	4:41 her right eye dilated. Slow the video down.
Samantha Rinker	You know what? I shoulda been Angelica for Halloween
lapis lazuli	When you die and find out that you have 27 demons and ghosts attached to you dont be surprised 😂
Alaina Graham	That spirit has now been freed. It's already targeting you guys.
Aly Odom	NOT A GOOD IDEA AT ALL BOI NOT SMART.
Angie Dolan	What is Jake's deal with burning demonic stuff😭😂
Brooklyn Alyese	"I said I'd make another video about her for fifty thousand likes." And he holds up a three and a zero😂
XxKenzie _WolfxX	I thought this would be a bad idea
Hanka Micova	Guys just oh goood watch yourself
Hailey Miller	I love u so much
Kayla Deliz	Don't you love how they decided to  burn her at night
Brenna Miller	when you are really focused on Jake’s video and you scream when his outro starts playing because you think it’s a jump-scare. that’s my life right now.
Genelle Vieira	The calls could’ve also been a fan trying to find out your number. Welp and of the possibilities just mean that you need a new number or even phone.
Cassie Jackson	She literally told you to take care of it... multiple times.. why tf would you Burn it?
Amya Statzer	I don't give a rats toot LOL hahhahahahaahahahahahahahahahaha idk why that is so funny I guess its the way he said it
Seanna Donnelly	4:49 was that a sherlock reference colby??😂
Anne Clearwater	This BETTER be your last burning haunted things video, because I did see the arm move (the one with the slit wrist). Sam didn't want to touch the doll (which is saying something). Colby was....not very nice to the doll. Its face definitely changed throughout the video. You kept getting calls from a random number whenever you tried to put it out. And "I got chills" just from watching  the freaking video! And you uploaded it a few days ago! It feels like something is literally standing behind me and watched the whole thing with me and is now very pissed and wants to murder me. And all of you three as well. Watch your step. The future is most definitely going to be in misfortune to at least you and Colby. Great, now there is a thunderstorm. Something is going to happen tonight. Thank you. Either way, all of you, even family and friends that were not involved with this at all, need to be careful. If theyaren't, it could mean accidents. Or in more sever cases serious injuries and quite possibly, death.
h0pe MSP	DUDE, you are gonna die. When you burn a possesed doll, you release all of the spirits from the doll. No, im not an expert, but i study ghosts and you CANNNOOOTTTT burn the doll. You'll start getting weird calls and texts. Im warning you..
Fay Ele	5:43 why does it look like her eyes are shaking...
joy steph	I love your vids
Aubrey Ann	Why did you do that that doll was attached to a spirit non the less a good spirit who wasnt doing you any harm ik you guys like the paranormal and all but id think you guys really understand it being a sensitive of the spirt world this is hard
Ava Zuccalo	I wish I was that doll ... when Colby was ......
KenzieMcKrackerz _	Jake at 11 seconds.... LOLZ hi jake
Angelwings 45	Ok so you basically released Angelica cause she was trapped in the doll. I would've barried it, in the woods, 6 ft under, and just forget about the doll
diablo 6	Did her eyes change colors or something because I thought they did
Doug	The entity is probably Kevin.😂
SamandColby Brocker	You dyed your hair again😘
Peachy Productions	Jake can I get merch for meh b day it was Saturday
Crazy Girl	SO SCARY OMG ....
isabella	He said the eyes were orange but I see them pink
Ashes Schnitzle	if the doll is how the person died then they probably did cut there wrist because if u just your wrist that way its harder to stitch it back up so she would most likely bleed out
Nichole Eccles	Colby r u color blind it’s pink....
Pewdiepie Legacy	Where her wrist is cut I have the same thing  bc I went tho a glass door and almost died
Nova Star	I swear to god she's in love with colby just like the rest of us
The Gamer	Mabey its a voodoo doll
taeyong enthusiast	yall..... when you get a call on an iphone it doesnt say unavailable unless you change that ti a persons name...
veronica ramirez	I hit that like button ... Keep this good videos coming .. also you should later try to burn the arm as well to see if it does burn ..
OPicebear 1359	I swear I thought I saw the doll’s mouth move at 4:40 but idk it might just be my mind playing some tricks on meh. -3-
{Meg Meg}	What if the lady...sees this video?
Brandy Swift	The doll mouth moved it looks like it smiled
Amanda ified	The fact that someone kept calling you over and over Jake.... you boys don’t ever listen ! “Take care of her” “keep her safe” Jake: “nahh let’s burn her!” WTF
Catelyn Humphrey	I have a theory Angelica is a voodoo doll, which explaines the cuts and stuff, maybe as experiments from the original owner. Also, when Angelica was on fire, maybe the original owner felt it, and tried to call Jake, because she was in pain. Which would also be the reason she told Jake to take care of it, seeing as it was her voodoo doll.
Sterek Haleinski	The poor woman that owned that doll is so worried about it all the time it's really sad to believe that they'd burn something dear to another person's soul... It's a little disappointing to me...
Khaya C	It's a bad idea to burn anything haunted. I'm not saying it is haunted (even tho it looks to be) I'm saying in general. Burning haunted things sets the ghost out to the world,its basically opening a door to our world. I'm a wiccan and a medium and have researched the hell out of this because I had some problems with ouija boards. You guys do what you wanna do just please be careful
Guard Grandma	This is so stupid omgggggg
GhostWolfXOX	And suddenly, this turned into a Shane Dawson video! 😂
Evan Moores	nice video but like,, maybe that doll used to belong to somebody that the woman loved, like a daughter or sister? and couldnt bare to have it near them bc of bad memories but just wanted it to be looked after,,, its quite rude that you burnt it idk? i mean i cant explain the cut on its arm or its undeniable spookiness but idk,, i just felt rlly bad when watching this,, ik reggie bought it so its technically not the womans anymore but,, she just seemed really worried
Skye Myers	The very second they started doing shit to the doll in the fire pit, my computer started glitching out BAD and this is a brand new computer guys. And as they were about to set it on fire my laptop glitched and then went white. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear everything. I had to restart my computer, and it was fine after that until you guys started to put out the fire. When fire was shooting from her head, my computer glitched again for a sec. It was weird you guys, but do NOT burn that doll all the way. It's still trapped inside it and it needs to stay that way, you need to get rid of the doll by selling it or giving it away or something. You need to get it out of your house. But do NOT, I repeated *DO NOT* UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BURN THAT DOLL TO ASH!!
Aly J	"Why is her head igniting!?"   *flashes back to a few moments ago where they poured the most gasoline on her head*    😂😂😂😂
a person that u don't know	Yeah blow on the fire give i to oxygen 🙄😂
soalharvester595 Alpha_panda_gamer_jeff	That was f*&@ing creepy
Karina meh	No nononononono 😭wtf did you do
Madeline Armand Taylor	JAKE WEBBER HAVENT YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE RAGING COMMENT SECTION ON YOUR DYBBUK BOX'S BURNING VIDEO?! 90% of the comments on that video was about how you shouldn't have burned things that have demons or spirits trapped inside of it. I dont understand how you could even come up with the idea of burning this doll when people have been commenting A LOT about how bad of an idea it was for you to burn these demonic stuff cuz it's literally releasing the demon inside. Please jake, for these kinds of serious issues, consult from those who are more experienced. You dont mess with paranormal stuff. We bother to write such comments because we care about your safety. :))
Rimini Chesworth	Jake, I love u and all, but I think this was a bad idea... 😬
Just Me	Colby: She has beautiful eyes  Me: yeah, ikr  Jake: haha PSYCHOPATH  ME: smh I was just admiring her eYes... and they’re not orange... they’re pink.
Shindi Naomi	Greatest intro ever; "Hey"
Mariya Campos	So you burned her before knowing her story? That’s kind of fucked up....
Sour Candy	"Yall 3 are going to hell" sam jake n colby "we are all in this together!"
venefica aure	In the dream I had about your doll after you posted the first video, she was very aggressive. BTW burning something that holds an entity, let's that entity out to attach to something new.
AannW Rootbeer	How you all have yet lost your soul to the devil is on me. I mean holy cow. Even I got the creeps after this.
شيخه الكبيسي	Dude there is an app called real caller and it tells you who’s number that is if you wanna know
Natty Joachim	that doll looks like me on picture day
Carley Clokey	That’s the creepiest looking thing I’ve ever seen..it’s one of those things where I’d see it down the hall, run and turn the light on.why do you guys do all this creepy crap?
Tricia Dela Torre	You know when you use gasoline to create a fire it usually is harder to put out the flames using water. This is why fire extinguishers are more advisable. I think what happened was that the gasoline seeped into the hollow part of the doll's head and the pops were just because of the gasolline and the heat and pressure that built up inside the head. I don't know about the scar though or the timing of the pops hehe.
KittyCat 11	Good.... Job Jake.
Gemma Duff	I had chills watching this video
Daniela Zorin	SHIT who got scared by the outro cuz I DID
SkylerY Yanime	That's so creepy >.<
Mischief Gaming	I kinda feel bad for the doll like she didn’t do anything, now you’ve kinda just pissed the doll off she gonna come throw you in the fire pit now😂Rest in peace Angelica
Our Lord and Savior Pete	Maybe it didn't burn cause it wasn't in the fire
Hanatuzuki Shiori	I hope Colby buy more white sage that he bought before..  correct me nicely if I spell something  or say something wrong, please
iEditors 1817	FUCK MY NAME IS ANGELICA bye💀👋
Xy- -ri	So ..let me understand please because I've seen her eyes more worried about what was going on. You burned her after the owner told you to keep her safe ..and then you receive more calls from probably the owner. I think the owner was in some way attached to Angelica and you set the demon or whatever was in that doll free that's why she was popping and her face literally burned in a hell flame. And what if that doll was a voodoo doll? What if the owner called her Angelica but the doll is actually the owner? I don't know what to think more and what to say. Just one thing Jake: never burn demoniac things, they're demons they live in flames.  EDIT: I FELT SOMEONE BREATHING BEHIND MY NECK WHILE I WAS WRITING THE COMMENT AND I'M HELL SERIOUS.
Big Robz	Anima
Mia Rossouw	You should text the person and say that the doll is died now
Katie Dillon	I actually started to feel bad once you started burning the doll and when you three it on the fire
horror movies is the best !	When i just started watching this video i got a spider on my arm
Maia Jaye	oh man, they are screwed
Erykah M-M	Omg I swear her eyes grew wider when they put her in the the thing to burn her
Kate Carmichael	It went from happy to pissed off when you dropped it in the fire pit
Pettyvxbes	Boi am I blind or did I see those fucking irises dilate?
#1Candy EVER	“The eyes are orange” bish No their not. Their pink asf
TYPICAL JACOB	You all are so dumb by burning the doll your releasing the spirit into your house
Bruce Dsilva	Instead of showing 5 fingers for 50000 he showed 3 so it means 30000 likes
Bridget Trammell	I swear I wish you would just throw it against a wall it freaks me out when you have her looking in the camera... you should have told the lady hey you need to tell what is up cause she scares me and I’m about to get rid of her .. I can’t believe you’re burning her ... I don’t like it ahhh ahhhh
Aleyna Beki	I think he should call or meet up with the previous owner and ask about the backstory... and maybe show the good care he has taken of the doll
Alsya Marinda	SAVAGE JAKE😂
Jeaven Pabrua	Yo, imma send this to the woman u just texted HAHAHA. I actually saw her doll in the past selling it on ebay so i know her contacts
Downey Black-Spencer	Btw idk if this makes a difference but if you burn a dybbuk box you have unleashed the dybbuk and it will take a long time to burn but you unleashed the dybbuk for good and it can never be returned also in doing some reading on the back of the neck of angelika it seem to have the work shena well in researching about the dybbuk box that ghost adventures has which you may wanna look at there is a reference to shema and in doing more digging there are other dolls made just like angelika and there on etsy also in researching the dybbuk box that ghost adventures has there are multiple references to the etsy website and i researched more there was a holocaust victim named angelika who was horribly degraded, raped by multiple nazi soldiers, mutilated, and murdered in front of her family. Which consisted of her, her mother, and 2 younger brothers and they swore revenge against Germany and the Nazis and the last know descendent of her was a women named Angie who had her 2 yr old daughter murdered and she several years later was horribly murdered in both cases the murders were never caught and what happened from there no one knows. Jake I am not saying any of this to scare you but to inform you. I believe you have unleashed the dybbuk to yourself i have noticed certain things you have been doing since you opened it that are strange and I do not believe you unhexed yourself using that spray. I feel your life is in danger that the dybbuk grows stronger and you are getting traits from it I also believe you should contact a Rabbi I know I sound like a crazy person but I have seen and know more than I want to. Im begging you to please seek help from someone in Hebrew religion preferably a Rabbi ASAP!!!! Before it's too late!!!! Like I said this is a concerned fan wanting to keep all involved safe!!! But ultimately you do as you choose. I wish you good luck!!! And blessings. And I also ask that you guys and all other youtubers quit messing with the unknown because somethings are not ment to be dug up or messed with and you all are basically intriguing the minds of vunerable audiences for likes and subscribes and ultimately causing them to cause harm to themself and others tampering with things they shouldn't and possibly releasing evil spirits and demons to our world. PLEASE do better research. And DON'T mess with things that are hidden or sealed it was put there for a reason!!!! PLEASE!!!! And little side note the dybbuk knew if you burnt the boxes it couldn't be locked away again therefore unleashing it forever. Good luck!!!! Best wishes!!!!! And I hope you listen. Please for everyone's safety
Queen WildBeauty	Do not sit outside at 1 in the morning watching this.  😂 I was tripping so hard, I ran in the house.  You guys are bat shit crazy.
naomi fonseca	what if that was the doll calling you. :0
Abbey Menchin	Make a pt about when the lady tells you the back story??
Alvaneya Navarro	Reminds me og the movie The Boy like boi that is creepy.
Abri Atencio	What would have been the most scariest thing is if that when y'all wake up in the morning the doll was just sitting outside by the fire pit in perfect condition.
Galactic Shadow	dude... you hella dead
Andu	Si chuyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Sadi Preve	Simple Salt and Burn case
Musicly Stars	I love you Jake! 💓 Your have the best content! 💝 I wish the best on your videos!💞 Your so funny!😫 #JakeWebber #ScaryWebber #WebberSquad #FunnyJake 💜
Ayanna Slaughter	Wtf did you guys do to Kevin 🤣😯
Hardy Har Har	Uh.. she has orange eyes? Looks pink to me
Torrie Mluzan	I love how ever clip, Jake's in a new position 😂😂
Rebecca Adkins	10/10 that doll was possessed by something and it’s probably still there and it’s probably really pissed off now
ArkerTheGreat	Shut up we love you
Kaleigh Betancourt	tell me why the eyes moved at 4:43
Christa Ellsworth	Do you want ghosts?
Veronica _ Family	That so stupid 😭😭😭💀
me95917	I'm still subbed but like every time I looked at it I felt like it moved. Bad idea Jake...
Ethan Van Emmerik	Her eyes are purple colby
Fluffy Marshmallows	Jake.......... YOU'RE SO STUPID!!!!! I love y'all and everything but that was beyond stupid! Please PLEASE stay safe!!
Kayla Joyce	Burning it was a bad idea. When you burn objects that have spirits trapped inside of them the spirit doesn't just disappear. That will release the spirit, which is far more dangerous.
kk plays	That was wrong
Jayla B	Colby spanks the doll 😂😂😂😂😂😂👏
Mercedes Ireland Mua	Idk but I saw an upside down cross when they were burning the doll lol
TheDivergentSlytherin	Honestly, call me crazy, but I would’ve just kept the doll 😂 I mean, I would actually take care of it and talk to it because I’m fucking weir but seriously, I would’ve taken her! I just turned thirteen and am not even scared of it. You can kill me if you want!
Gay Subway	IDGART   I  DONT GIVE A RATS TOOT
ミッフィーチェーンWolfeChan	Why do I watch these scary videos before I fall asleep?
Taleah S	I don’t know why I found it funny every time they cussed it went   *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* 😂
No Name	3:17 orange lmao i see bright pink
Zamo Tv	The last time Sam starts pouring water on it he hits the un burnt hand and it moves up and down. However it then starts going side to side
Bryan Droptini	if you look closely u can see the eyes move like light flickering don't burn it
Jeff the Killer Lover	at 11:22 watch right above her lip there is still the blood or lipstick smere and she looks sad....also di you ever think that by burning the doll you free the spirit into your home......
__emily	The owner of the doll is going to show up 😂💀
Sedona13 Penny	2:29 KEVIN 🤤😨😵😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱☠

Nattie	This pisses me off so fucking much. This is so disrespectful on so many levels. Looks like you've learned fucking nothing you shit head
amy	do yall not know how fire works lmao
MacKenzie Hall	I think you guys have officially lost it lol
trex ballerina	4:41 why do the doll's pupils get bigger for a second and shrink back down??
Always Jalynn	He should be waited to hear more backstory to it💯 burning the doll could've jyst made everything worse & you guys are back to square one where u guys were when y'all were playing the midnight man & all those other rituals💯 you guys could've sold it to Zack Baggins the Ghost adventure guy to put that thing in the museum💯💯 if y wanted to get rid of it. Do research before burning evil haunted things
duhh its me	The end made me jump 😂
Nikki Boyatzies	You should try to find the obituary or backstory on the lady who had her who died. I seriously think the owner put her in the doll or some shit. I have a feeling she killed herself like her wound on her arm is how she died. I’m very sensitive to paranormal stuff and like spirits and i can’t stop thinking about it. Also That lady had to have felt that dolls spirit be freed or something. She was so attached and ew I have such a gross feeling.
Bratannah	Your hair ❤️❤️❤️
Maija Pakkanen	the moment when she caught on fire looked weird, arms wide open and the furious look in her eyes
constance williams	Did you know that if you burn something that is cursed that they can have acsess to you so I would stay up all night if I were you or go spend the night in someone's room
Destiny Banchich	You guys should have hidden a camera on the doll and seen if it moved
Pinkghost_22	I think you should have put holy water on it before you burned it
May K	You should stop burning stuff like that Jackey, you know before things get worse.
Cheyenne Brewer	U are not smart for burning that
XxItsGellyxX ello	OMG MEH NAME IS ANGELICA!!!!!!!!!!! ( WHY MEEEEEEEE?!?!?!?!? Why does everyone hate meh? ... I love ur vids btw❤)

Jennifer Lynn	You probably just forgot to DM me but you can date me though🤷🏻‍♀️
smug f4nt4	Jake made a really bad mistake burning that doll, a really bad one. He shouldn't have burned it. Just a feeling.
Lexi🌑	Sam: “How did that happen?” Me: “Fire.”
Wolf Bitch	You could've given me the doll I really liked it...
Blue Gangsta	Should’ve gave it back to the lady, this is kinda fucked
sunny studios	I feel like im the only one thats re watching like three times in a row?
Calie R	Wtf that was the most stupidly entertaining thing ever
Virgil Sanders	You guys fucked up big time.     That was a real real bad idea.
holly13000	I felt so sad for that doll ☹️ I wanted to protect her or something
Tania Escobedo	I feel really bad for the doll.. y’all shouldn’t have burned it.
Lilith Stefanovich	Should of put salt on it then it would be dead for reals fool
Kim Jack	When Sam sed what is up with you burning Evil crap all I could think about was Shane Dawson burning stuff
Woodzy Girl	THEY TOLD YOU TO KEEP IT SAFE OMG IM SO WORRIED FOR YOU GUYS WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
Christiona Fourman	Honestly I don’t think you should have burned her
It's yuh girl mikkeai8908	Jake never learns. You're not supposed to burn cursed objects Jake. Now you have just freed the evil spirit that was trapped within the doll.
tammygibbs	Omg be safe and stop!!!

NoodleDaddySenior :3	All of a sudden someone calls him and all you hear is “Is Angelica alright?”
Maddison_yeemo24 Yeemo	This was insane. Stay safe. Love u 💜
Kawaii Pandie!	The head was igniting because there was air in the dolls head so it was making it worse and sorry I have a spelling disorder
makeupbyjesss	jake i love you. stay safe 🖤
Chloe S. Mendoza	10:50 it was her for sure
Spicey-Chan	You just burned a innocent soul in a doll when I saw you burn it I knew there was something wrong not right
Alexia Harp	i just now got the notification for this. what the fuck youtube
Haylie Pierce	You could of just sent the doll to me lol
Trinity Garrett	By burning the doll you burned its home so now it's spirit is free
Max	Am I going crazy or was the doll’s expression actually changing on camera  Like not just  Bam bam bam instantaneous change Gradually on camera like a real human
ThatCrazy AnimalLover	I saw that on Instagram that freaked me out lol
schuuichiminamino	Can't wait on the feedback of what is about to happen now on. Good luck Jake. You can run away to my country if you will. I'll take good care of you. I won't set you in fire. Promise.
Cindy Michelle	I think burning the doll was a mistake but since you did it I think you should’ve burned it all including her arm
Olivia A	dude so at the end of the video where they showed the doll one last time my computer froze on the close up of the face and i kept clicking escape and the space button  to fix it and it just logged me out of my computer and then it wouldn't let me back in for a minute. thats never happened before ever
sianemmajones	Umm sorry but everyone knows that if you have a spirited doll and you think something negative is attached to it, you do not burn it, is like releasing a genie from the bottle to do what it likes :/ :( be careful guys!
JIMIN POP	WHY THE FUDGE WOULD YOU BURN THE DOLL!?!?! LIKE TFHJSDBKJSjFCDS
Nico Di Angelo	As a Wiccan, burning spirits like that is absolutely a bad idea. ESPECIALLY when they say they have bad intents. That spirit was released from the doll, partially. Fully when you poured the water on it to put it out. I do highly recommend seeing a priest, because as you said, that spirit is going to be extremely pissed when it comes back.
Koffee_ 399	what if the spirit inside the doll is connected to the person that owned the doll or what is the owner is the spirit inside the doll.. idfk 😂
Delia Welker	wtf is wrong with you jake
Willow Garcia	The dolls mouth lowered at 5:37
Ezra Sanchez	You just let it free by burning it inside of the doll if it was someone there spirt just got it and could hurt anyone else in that house .
Kia Laursen	Am I the only one who sees the eyes move at 4:42 ??
dum dum	I have a Theory a game theory sorry I'll stop but for real I heard if you have mirrors looking at each other that allows demons and or ghost,and how you have a bathroom I think with a lot of mirrors looking at each other that might allow demons and or ghost in your house.That is why think you are hearing things and you think it is haunted.
cheesetoastie11	This gave me chills
Mariah Marty	Did anybody else see the doll started shaking when Sam started getting the water closer to it's head or am I just going Insane
Kaitlyn Goldsberry	Omg the doll’s facial expression changes throughout the video😧
Cat Gaming The Deadest Youtube Channel	I kind of feel bad for her
Numb Nuts	ARE WE JUST GOING TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT COLBY MIGHT BE COLOR BLIND. BECAUSE HE THINKS THE DOLLS EYES ARE ORANGE WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY PINK LMFAO
Natalie Zdzieblo	the eyes scared me the most... doll eyes do not normally do that. sending love and prayers to you all🙏❤️
tam	sometimes i think yall fuck with these ghosts because you want to be haunted,, be careful guys seriously you joke but you're gonna get yourselves possessed.
Jennyy D	Bro so I stop and took a pic on snap at 4:46 and stoped at 5:29 and puased it and the face expression changed 💀
stranger 2 dolan	It looks like her finger is moving on the burnt hand in 9:55 - 10:03
Gracie Binette	Jake... why

ɪt raɪns	FAAKK The ending song scared me so badly

A Wleklinski	OMG THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT SAID “That was a mistake.” AND THE USERNAME WAS It’s Angelica WTF, THAT SCARES ME SO MUCH LIKE I FREAKING TEARED UP
Tanja M Dahl	Leave it overnight on the couch and film it and see what happens🙉
Lexi828	Jake's outro music always makes me jump after these videossss jumpscaresssss
Haley Marie	Guess you can say that this video was...LIT. But all jokes aside you should keep us posted about the after math and that lady! Maybe make a video of you telling her you burned the doll and see what she says.
Nadia Dragoncage	You dyed your hair my favourite colour! :D
Christine Castillo	Colby lol
Jo Jo Campbell	I hope that wasn't that lady calling wanting her doll back 😂 or maybe she has some attachment to that doll and she felt something bad happening to the doll 😱
Caity Moss	When Sam the person who ALWAYS does 3:00 AM challenges and messes around with haunted things wont even hold the doll is when you know its bad lmao. Jake shouldn't have burnt the doll it just released the spirit and you should've waited until the lady who sold it told you the WHOLE story
Allex Strider	That lady told y’all to keep it safe you burn it? Wow
Richard Baranowski	I think it was kind of a dick move burning the doll after you told the woman you were going to take care of it. Creepy as the doll is/was the woman who sold it was obviously very attached to it.
Clickbait	No guys wrong move your so close to letting the spirit free your putting yourself in danger and if you burn it to ashes then who knows what damage will be done
Madi Hollingsworth	Imagine the soul just screaming in pain
kenzie christine	Please be careful guys, this was a really bad idea.
Patricia Martinez	Wow what a great ending-just showing us the burned dolls face is greeaat*cries in a corner*
Goat boat	HER HAND WITH THE CUT IS NOT BURNING
Maqaroon	I have the uneasiest feeling you can ever get in the world.. It really was a BIG MISTAKE for burning that doll. Imagine that old lady from Kansas calling you one day, asking for the dolls care and comfort. Or maybe she sensed that the doll is dead although DON'T BURN THW WHOLE DOLL! THE SPIRIT KEEPS THE DOLL AS A VESSEL. IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, IF THE SPIRIT BREAKS FREE. YOU DONT KNOW HOW SCARY THE SPIRIT MAY BE OR HOW EVIL IT IS AND WHAT IT'S ABLE TO DO!! Just be careful!!!
Alycia Harp	Why would you burn the vessel?? That’ll only release the spirit
ZOEY STRONG	Bitch u should have looked up  what to do
Mariana Malta	Dude you are crazy
ᴍᴀɪᴀ.	Y'all are always doing some fucked up shit. Take wanna be Annabelle out, wrap her in a clean white cloth and bury her far away from you, pour salt on her grave then never go there again. UGH YOU BOYS WILL GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK.
Nikora Bagzie	The ending though
heller msp	Jake "why is it burning so fast"  Um idk, probably BECAUSE YOU PUT WAY TO MUCH "LIQUID" ON IT
Allie Kitty	How many times do we have to tell you jake...burning the doll only makes it worse smh
Jaylyn Dinn	Never pour water over an open flame put dirt over it
M & S	normally i don’t believe in all this stuff or care but this gave me seriously bad vibes ...
Nikita Bowe	Lads am I color blind or are the eyes pink ?
wolfiplier wolfie	I think you should've answered the phone when the doll was still on fire. The reason I think this is because if you did answer and said hello, someone might've said something back. Because if it was the doll, it could've said something. That might the reason when you did answer that no one said anything, because you put the fire out and there was almost nothing left. This is just one of my conspiracy theories.  Love ya'll! Keep up the good work on vids and if you need any advice on paranormal stuff, just ask me cause i know A LOT! <3
Peter Lariviere	you should of kept it and not burned it .. bad idea .. she was special and you should of just hung onto it.
Makayla Ross	Lady:is she ok  Jake: yah (also Jake) where gonna burn the doll XD
zoeyLoLcutie 1617	I really Liked the video but the lady never said it was a bad spirt or evil you shouldn't burn it any way evil or not but what if she's was a good spirt you probably should of checked before you did that it would be kinda sad if she was a good spirt
Annette Miller	"take care of the doll like it were your own...." Hope she don't see this video 😂😂
Hailee Fair	Omg this scared the shit out of me 😂😂 I’m praying for you Jake,Sam and Colby. 👏🏻
Aleksandra Georgieva	Jake for us the eyes are pink for you and the others they are orange that is maybe because it doesn´t want to have anything to do with us but it wants something from you
Cindy’s DTXplr Edits	Like for Kevin’s thicc body
Holly Drury	This video possessed me 😂
Richelle Santos	yall fr about to get more haunted like 1000000%
Naleena Villarreal	u probably just released a demon
Jackie Martinez	Ily
eturnal_kat_gamer :3	JAKE HOLY FUCK BALLS AND COCK
Bexsternaitor	Is it just me or did anyone notice that it kinda looked like a cross when it was a burning
Marik Ishtar	I would've taken her for free.   Edit: I love haunted things.
ParkChoiJeon -	Jake... did you NOT read the comments saying that burning these type of stuff is literally the WORSE idea you could have ? .. no ?? Thought so ..
I’m Angelica	That was a mistake.
Andy Scene	Min 5:51 you can hear someone humming (Female)😱
the kittens	What would you do if that released her spirit
jazmineriva	oh no.........
Olivia Beatham	Don’t read this...   Oh look you’re reading this I thought I said not to....    You’re still here!!!???   Ok this is getting to serious stop reading this before you get to the.....     Boo 👻 it’s almost Halloween 🎃  Happy early Halloween 🎃 😊  I scared you didn’t I 😂😂😂😂 Jk
Teela	After they spanked its but it looked like it was smiling.
Martina Anitram	What if that lady.. previous owner.. wants to buy it back? Oof
Joshua Alvarez	You say your scared but you fucks with the ouija board???? Lol i mean if anything, a spirit is already latched to you. You just cant physically see it.
Angie Ryen	Hey Jake, so I have told Sam and Colby both about this. I recommended coming to Lily Dale, New York. I have lived near there for my entire life and the mediums there are legit. You all should come and get a reading done. Something can be done to protect you all from the beings in your house and anything you decide to contact later. Mediums here are usually in business during the summer when people are traveling, but I'm sure strings could be pulled to make it possible for you to get readings done whenever. Please come and get some help with all this spiritual stuff.  I'm seriously worried about you all, especially after this video.
CKFilmzTV	At 9:39, the hand starts moving as if it was squirming because of pain.
Kalei Seno	I’m literally watching this in broad daylight and I’m spooked, guess i won’t be taking my nap
Erin McCormick	So everyone saying the pupil moves at 4:42, slow the video down to the slowest one and it moves 100%

Freya W	what the fuck jake why would you do this
Heema	Idk why im watching this alone in my dark room rn when its night here..
Gaby Daoud	Jake i think ur stupid cz u released the fucking spirit you dumb fuck and now start complaining about having ghosts and paranormal activity at the house real smart realll smart. And i know playing with stuff that are devilish make ur life miserable so go see a priest and stop playing with stupid stuff
Crazy Unicorn	7:50 what is this thing in the right up cornerof the fire?????
CpTheRanger Ttv	DUDE YOUR OUTRO SCARED THE LIVING POO OUT OF ME!!!
Lps Honey Senpai	Is Satan controlling instead of the girl who died..
Dawnyelle Reece	is it just me or when they were burning the doll I got hot as if someone was burning me
Flower Freak	So light 'em up, up, up Light 'em up, up, up Light 'em up, up, up I'm on fire
Kiara Molina	I was honestly scared and felt bad cause the lady asked multiple times to keep the doll safe. And now it's gone/dead.  no hate tho <3
Ava Laine Precour	You tried so hard to burn it. But was ro hainted to do so
Deamon Kitty	This video gave me the fucking chills
Sydney Meyer	I’m glad you did what you did.... I can feel the bad energy coming threw my phone I don’t wanna sound creepy and sometimes I don’t believe the shit you do but you definitely need to bless your home...
WHOSLAUREN_ XD	LOOK AT THE CONJURING! THE DEMON GIRL HAS SLITS ON HER RISTS JUST LIKE THE DOOL YOU BURNED! (The conjuring is based off a true story.)
hydi c.	READ YOUR COMMENTS JAKE! EVERYONE TELLS YOU THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO HANDLE THIS STUFF BUT NO! YOU DO THE BAD THINGS!
rayn3260 rayn3260	Angelica is one thiccc bih
Daimarie Tenney	I liked it!!!
Gray Jimin	You should not have burned it
Samuel Vilei	you are fucked
Makenna Silva	doesn’t burning the doll, release the spirit inside it?
itsjustteagan	When u burn it I swear it sets the soul free or to another object
Dariann Adams	Omg can someone tell me why I started to feel sad and about to cry when he put the doll on fire. I like felt guilty or something. The dolls face when u burned it was so creepy. I got chills when u guys started to put water on it and someone or something started to call Jake... Guys that was a bad idea to burn that doll u shouldn’t have done that. I think u just let out the soul 😭😬😬🤭😲 be safe
Life Of Kiki	OHHHH NOOOOO ......
ah yeet	What happens if that lady finds this video?
Cry Baby X	Colby is showing us all of his kinks
Ana Ana	Early YAYY
Eric Lindesay	7:50 look at the top right of the fire pit. SHADOW HANDS
Grace Lillian Simon	Not like it would matter now, but burning with salt actually works so that probably would’ve helped. Just a thought for the future since we all know you guys are gonna keep messing with these sorts of things.
Maddy Grace	207 is a Maine phone number..
NerdyEcho	on camera the eyes look pink not orange
aya-412	use spy caller to get the number
Trina XxxX	I had to pause the video to take care of my dishes and all of a sudden right when I turned my phone off I got a random phone call. It scared the crap out of me.
Fancy vlogs With ari	*I missed their vids*     ❤️❤️❤️
Shweet_gothy_pie	I think this is really disrespectful. I would’ve taken care of her. Have fun getting haunted
Fausta Užkuraite	you f*cking idiot  why ...wait wait wait you realy did that NOW at first can you wait to heard her istory you realy dead! her soul free now and that b*tch say that you not save so  WHY THE F*CK YOU DID THAT ?!!?!?
Jasmine Corona	“ I have receipts sis “ 😂
Arleth Pérez	WTF DO YALL KNOW THAT BURNING POSSESS STUFF IS SO DUMB MAYBE THE SPIRIT IN THEREWAS EVIL AND YALL JUST OH DANG IT Atleast yall are moving BUT STILL IT COULD FOLLOW YALL BC U FREE THE SPIRIT.....
Mollie Marks	jake, burning any 'possessed' object will only set the spiritfree. you should have sold it on or something. jake please cleanse yourself and your house. please jake you all are in EXTREME  danger.after the queen mary things you don't want any more, and as well as burning the dybuk box. STAY SAFE Xx
Issiah Montanez	If I was supposed to see a scary ass doll I'm kicking that shit thru a field goal
Ariel Ortmann	Omg the fact that the person kept calling..omg. They should try to call the number back..
Felix Clarke	GUYS DID YOU NOT LEARN FROM LAST TIME, DONT BURN THEM IT JUST SETS THE SPIRIT FREE!
hannah mackenzie	I feel like it’s facial expression changed when you put it into the fire pit honestly I’m terrified for y’all
Tegan B	That is some demonic shit

Kayla Fitz	Y’all gonna die 🤡
Fatima Munoz	Lol when he said 50,000 likes and he it up 3 fingers 😂❤️
Ava Sarkies	My bf ❤️💖
the turtletron	I have a feeling something bad will happen. You shouldn't have done that. You sure are in for it, Jake. You will surely regret it.
Nikki Richards	I don’t know why but I was eating and got sick to my stomach watching that doll burn
brock tarts	You shouldn’t have done this. The spirit trapped in this doll could have very well been attached in some way or related to the woman who gave Reggie the doll in the first place. This could have been the soul of a child, or a baby. The way the doll looks on the outside does not reflect was may have resided within. You burning it did not set its soul free; if anything, it just upset the spirit further. You should have taken the doll to a priest to get it blessed and find a way to release the spirit so it can go to the light and be released from this physical plane. Spirits were once human too, burning their physical vessel like this is just as disrespectful as forgetting they once existed.
Emma Grace	So I’m just now seeing this, and then when they started burning her I get a friend request on snap from some person i don’t know name Angelica I absolutely Lost my shit and hid under the blanket
its Addison games	Jake that's a 3 not a 5 XD
Zoe	Technically, Colby raped the doll and killed her like jesus dude
Fatal Stitches	Oof...
foxichu	if something is attached to that doll and it was cursed which it is hence the scar it has to find something new to posses . I hope it is going to not posses something new. :(
Samantha -	and it makes sense to kevin *and his nipples*
Annabelle 42	6:31 light em up up up light em up up up
Marika	when that doll was hardcore smoking I automatically blew on my phone🙄🙄😂
Mia Talbot	What if the lady sees this? She'll be so fucking pissed jakeeeee! If she wanted you to treat it like a child,there had to have been a good fucking reason!!!! I love you guys but!!! Your fucking idiots!!! My brother i think you fucked uppppp!!!!!!!!!
Yana Rossoshanskaya	2:28 What is wrong with Kevin? Who dressed him like that?! 😳😂😂😂
Olivia Barron	I’d take it as a compliment if Colby started humping me 😉😛😏
Sophie Robinson	You actually scared me at the front but you are soo funny and I love the way you talks and the zooms and different angles and those eyes tho love the hair
d.arkcolby.mp4	Sam & Colby : Orange eyes. Me: boys that's *pink*
Blonde Creature	You are fuckin hilarious. Love it ❣❣❣💙💙💙
Savannah Burnett	Did anyone crap them selves when the music came in at the end
Rufflebutt	oh boy that was a mistake. the spirit has probably attached itself to something else now and is now pissed off. you should not have done that.
Unicorn Farts	NO FUCKING JOKE WHEN I WAS WATCHING THIS A NEWS STORY ABOUT THE QUEEN MARY CAME ON AND THEY TALKED ABOUT ROOM B340 WTF.
Baka No Nightmare	I made a comment on Colbys video about why you shouldn't burn the doll. Welp, better get that priest over because you've just created a very angry spirit.
warrior cats fan	THE FUCK! MAN! BAD IDEA VERY VERY BAD IDEA!
BlueBubble Cosplay	You guys are fucked, may god be with you.  ***Me in my head*** ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID?! Hey let’s burn the doll! HELL NO
editingbel	i love u jake but....you’re a fucking idiot lmao
Louise S	The owners gonna be pissed😂
ᑭᖇOᒍEᑕT ʑơᖇɠơ	Omg your hair 😍😍😍
Like Whoa It's Trent	Hey, Jake, follow-up video idea - Maybe you could take the video of the doll burning to your local firehouse and ask a couple firefighters why the head seemed to burn so abnormally? They may have a logical explanation? Or they may be like, Holy crap, never seen anything like that before...  Regardless, I did NOT get a good feeling watching this video.
I LOVE BLEACH	Know I wanna dye my hair like Jake's
Liana Mcduff	4:42 and 5:42 her face totally different!!!! This is freaking me out Holy crappp!!!!!!!!
RAIDER RAGE	u idiot if ur gonna burn something that u think is posessed u need to pour salt over it before burning or the spirit wont go away u need to research this shit before doing it man
Laura Braun	You shouldn't have burned the doll.  It's probably possessed by a demon. If you burn conduit (because they can't possess objects only people so they use an object to get to you so they can possess you) they will be unleashed. Pls be safe! ❤
nyah nieves	-Burnig A Haunted Doll BAD IDEA- Me:YEAH NO SHIT!!!! HONEY!!!
Han Law	Her eyes moved at like 3:20 urrr ok ...
Cecilie Trolddal Juul Laursen S7A Sofiendalskolen	FINALLY YOU KILLED THAT F*UCKING DISGUSTING DOLL!!!!😖😨😨😬 dools are you some crazy ugly killer sh*t...
Cassidy Starr	Jake gets everyone else to do his stuff
Arwa’s World	Make i still don't understand....... WHY THE HELL DO YOU NOT HAVE 5 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also creepy awesome vid!!!!!
Cadence Barfield	“how is it burning that much” idk maybe cause you put a lot of burning fuel on it?????
Angelica Cunningham	This is weird but that's my name and spelled the exact same way
TimidCutie	I'm a little confused, is the camera not picking up the orange tone or am I seeing things? Cause those eyes look PINK, not orange in my eyes. (I know this is irrelevant but I might as well point it out.)
karla e	those phone calls were creepy as shit, daym that’s crazy! hahah mad respect jake, you got balls 🤣 🤟🏻🤜🏻
Kimberly alfaro	You guys literally do the things I would do but I’m such a pussy to do them so I love you guys
Kiwi The Great	I feel bad for the old owner and doll
20dakota03	Dont worry about the fact that the head of that doll gets more on fire when you put water on it, because (well I don't know what you guys springled on that doll) some sorts of liquid may get a more havier fire when you put water on it.  Love you guyss  I am sorry for my english tho. I come from the Netherlands soooo😂
Byron van niekerk	Shy is not than yout 😱😱
bru.itsPaige	omg what have u done if u burn a spiritual object (LIKE ANJELICA) u are destroying something or ones home pissing them off so yeh 'we're all gonna die'
Kawaii Psycho	*Jake singing happily* We're gonna die we're gonna die xD Why ain't anyone talking about that
Sinead Mohally	The only thing left in tact is her hand..
Victoria	dude this was probably the dumbest thing you guys have ever done
LFC Spectre	This is such a bad idea Jake Webber big mistake good luck with sleeps ahead including roommates.
belladonna morrison	that was a dick move she was so pretty .
Meghan K	5:41 into 5:42 her left eye moves....... I watched it like 10 times and it gets creepier every-time🤦🏽‍♀️
M S	3:18 orange . They are fucking pink
x gabrielle x	okay i'm freaking out... what if the lady will try to contact you again?
LD C	I don't know if you'll see this. but there are people who take possessed things & know how to "care" for them properly. Zack Bagand is one of them. I believe he's got a haunted museum where things like that are kept. Y'all should probably look into something like that instead of burning things like that. You keep screwing around with things like this & bad stuff keeps happening to y'all.
Xaya Blood	DUDE YOU DON'T PUT OUT GREASE FIRE WITH WATER OF FUCKING COURSE IT'S GONNA BLOW
lindsey taylor	I feel strangely sad that you’ve burnt her... I liked her 😢
Jessica Barron	4:41 lol
Isabel paniagua	Put the remains in a box and set it out to the ocean or put it in a cave
Michelle Dzbinski	Such a stupid idea 🤦🏼‍♀️ y’all are gonna get hurt ..
Taana Warren	Yo I swear I saw her shake when you guys putting out the fire
Your girl t	But can you keep the scary vids going? I live for these 😂👌🏻
Jaelyn Sebastian	the doll did not wanted to be free
Zaynah Begum	u guys r gonna get a spanking from the lady who sold reggie the doll.
holy shit	as soon as i saw the title i was like "wHy dId YoU dO tHaT? Of cOursE iT wAs A bAd IdEa"
Brin Chan	Ok so.. I scrolled down the comments and someone mentioned that the doll's pupil moved at 4:42 , something like that. So I went to 4:42 to check and I didn't see it move. BUT, i changed it up to speed 0.25 slow motion, and THE PUPIL ENLARGED AND SHRANK BACK A FEW TIMES. YOU NEED TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY TO CATCH IT
Stacy Lynn	WTH
Gabbie Gab	11:26 stare into her eyes
maureen T	Oh my god 😨 what have you done , you can't burned the doll , jake, if you burned that mean's her spirit is free when you said that when all you wanted to get closer she pop, so that means she wanted you guys to stay away so her spirit can free, jake and all the roomates you have to becareful because you just unleash something evil becareful jake, GOD please protect them, give this thumbs up for jake and all the roomates 💟👍👍💟💞💞💞
tam bam	yall literally know not to burn this haunted shit y'all done it before and everybody telling u but i guess views are more important
Madie Singer	Jake maybe the lady told you to take care of Angelica because something is inside the doll and if you burn the doll you could have released the spirit making Angelica even more powerful than she is in the doll. Long story short if Angelica is evil you are in deep 💩
Elmy Diaz	Ooooh Boy
Kat Space	Good job, you’ve pissed off a spirit and now it’s malicious and will search for revenge
Coley H	Don't judge me but that doll was so pretty.
ryuķ565	yous smile n joke round to much for me to think this is real 😅
jessica delarge	Holy fuck this scared the crap out of me!!! I hate knowing u guys could be in danger. Pls be careful ilysm ❤❤❤
Conceited Jay	Fucking insane......
Lexi Marie	It looks like when you tried to put its head out that whatever evil spirit was in the doll when it finally did go out, Looked like it left the doll. Which means y’all could be in for some stuff.
Min Suga	JAAAAAKE!!!! WHY?! IF YOU BURN _ANYTHING_ THAT IS HAUNTED IT DOESN'T GET RID OF IT, IT BRINGS THE SPIRIT INTO OUR REALM!!! and considering it was attached to the doll it's probably really pissed at you! PLEASE don't mess with things that you are uneducated about, especially the paranormal, or you will eventually run into an unfortunate event that will be way more life changing than even the Queen Mary incident _ever_ was. The spirit was best left in that doll. Had you shown her respect, she wouldn't have shown you anything less. Any spirit can be a nightmare if you anger it.... if you read this, Jake, please take my comment, not as hatred, but as an informative message to take into consideration for the safety of you, and those around you...
Lyla Tomar	I love Colby sm😂😂💀😘💖💕
nevvy XD	Ok what if the owner like before he posted this (jake) was like why did you burn her??!
Brooklyn Neibauer	If you burn a haunted doll the spirits will come out of the doll 😐
ineedalife 00	I know I may be trippin...  But at the end it looks like the face of Angelica is tear stained but IDK MAN I MAY BE TRIPPIN THO THIS VIDEO REALLY CREEPED ME OUT
XoXoQueenDaliahXoxo	YOUR SO DUMB JAKE!!!! WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE THE BAD SPIRIT INTO THE WORLD
Eily Sheehan	What's Eily, the overly scared, worried her house is haunted even if it isn't doing at 1am? Scary vides that are making her sweat
Emma Booth	GUYS I SPOTTED A WILD JONAS BROTHER IN THE BACK AT 2:30 THIS MADE ME JUMP SO BAD
Manuel Peru	Jake I don't think you don't do that because you will release that evil spirit and things will get much worse, and you and your friends will be in greater danger.
Sphoorthy Kandra	SPIRITS USE ELECTRONIC STUFF AS MEDIUM TO CONTACT PEOPLE IN FEW CASES....EVEN THERE ARE MOVIES BASED ON THIS....IN CASE U DINT KNOW THOSE CALLS MIGHT BE FROM ANGELLICA AND PROBABLY THERE NO WAY U CAN GET RID UNLESS U GO FINDOUT FROM PRIEST OR SOMETHING...BE SAFE JAKE...DONT GET UR SELF INTO TROUBLE FOR VIDEOS
Metalfy	Jake that's the worst thing you could've done. Burning a possessed object is not gonna help you get rid of it. And I don't think the woman that owned it will be happy...
ᄀᄂSongmin	Okay but like, Angelica's eyes look pink to me, but Colby said they were orange?? I'm deadass so confused,, maybe it's just the camera that makes them look pink??
Banar Nilam Sari Wijayanti	You're the dumbest person I've ever seen bro. I'm not even brave enough to touch kinds of things like that but you BURNED IT WTFFF
Jasmine Andersson	Her eyeballs whas moving back and front.  🔥🔪🖤👹😭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😵
乙卂匚卄丨'爪	Did u see that sort of white/black Bodie like flame shape go up into the air?
Rima El-Alo	The phone call could also be some weirdo people recording your voice to use it to sell shit to people because that's a thing. I don't know why they would keep calling but yeah. Creepy man.
Kane Deverall	Tell the owner that you burned her
Lindsey Tomlinson	Umm Colby dont say your a sociopath because Shane dawson will get you  Shane Dawson has entered the chat
Twika	Colby really wants a girlfriend 😂
ugandan knukles	My house has been more and more haunted ever since my 13 birthday witch was a on the 4th.  While watching this vid my tablet flew across the room.  I'm scared.
Ruby Davies	What would we do if Angelica got set free even though there was no way out the doll and it kills you and the room mates
siddhimoodley	was that ending really necessary i almost cried
xXsgtSNIPER66Xx Add Xbox	Since the scared arm was left maybe the spirit was released from the doll
nichole rose	That was so scary and u are amazing and awesome and keep up the good work
Marshall Hall	Wtf at 4:42 the eyes do fucking move I’m done my g that’s fucked up
Bryan Vargas	Next thing u Know the doll reappears trying to kill ya for burning
Angela Stell	NOOOOOOOOO YOUR NOT supposed to burn it that's really bad you sell it to someone else oh my God you're going to regret that so much
Amber Louise	Jake’s dimples 😩❤️. Colby’s smile🙈❤️. Sams laughes💕.
Vanessa	All the fans/watchers: "DONT BURN THE DOLL, YOULL RELEASE SOMETHING" Jake+roomates: *"BURN IT"*
Emily Twizzlerbee	Half of these comments are saying not to burn the doll. You do you boo boo.
skyeanais ayris	Don't wanna make y'all freak but flames coming out of the eyes mean's demonic, im afraid you let a demon out of its trapped body. when trapping a demon you have to keep the thing trapped, Now there maybe danger coming your way. Be careful.
Tina	if the doll really was haunted, and the spirit had bad intentions.... then this was a bad BAAAAAAAAAAD idea
Marije Zwaal	Omg when jake was called in the video, someone called me, that was scary, exactly on the same time.
Crimson Smile	dude you have a deathwish all of you realse the demons at your house what did you expecting ?
Dancing Star India	You're stupid wtf. Your ass will get haunted and then yo gon cry.

Damijana Aukselis	Jake Burning haunted things to make his house even more haunted Since 2017
isabella hepburn	i cant be the only one that saw the dolls arm move at 9:38
Beni Venetta	Oh my goodness... 😢 why do I have this feeling of sadness? Which is almost like you're torturing a child. I know its haunted and stuff and I understand you wanna take it away, but.. Oh man.. Anyways good luck. Don't know how you'll survive
hfkgore	How did that happen? Idk sam, i think it's because....it's melting

Izzy IsYellow	BBSNSND RIP MY EARS WITH HEADPHONES IN THEM AT THE BEGINNING 🤧💀
Jessica Clark	holy heckballs
Andrea Williams	Crazy hey 😕 keep safe guys 🙏💖
Lilla	I think the best idea would be to pay a priest to move into this house with you guys, it's the only hope😂🙇🏻‍♀️
Akanksha Kohlib	Idk why but when they burnt the doll I got weird feeling I just don't get it why did I get that weird feeling 😥😱💀💀👻👻

Sky Hislop	I thought that was colby s doll
Ali Quenery	Goodluck on thay jakeyyy.
kirstin gracee	but like i need colby's sweater, like my own, it's bangingg
Inspiredbycolbybrock 5	I think Colby is colour blind.
Trym The Viking	u brought it on yourself..... by burning her ...
Amzie xxx	What I found weird is that when Sam was VERY gently pouring the water on the dolls face it ignites really big through it's EYES and then immediately after the flames go out... Sam poured just a trickle of water and that happened??? Also I think her face blew up the most bc they were joking around at the start so they ended up putting loads of lighter fluid(?) on her face... thats probably why... be REALLY safe guys ❤
norjihan abdul rahman	Never burn curse object... Give to someone else.. I bet many oddities collecter want the doll.... In my religion.. Satan and devil are made from fire..  so.. it will not affect that doll at all coz the doll only a vessel.. gud luck to you guys!!..
Andy Indra	5:50 I feel like I heard a girl's voice like "hmm"
Priyanshu Singh	Sociopath 😂😂i knew its gonnna come 😂😂

Helen Greensmith	Omg. Best. Fucking. Intro. Ever!!! 😂😂
Jono Lovegood	Last night or the other night I had a dream I was about to burn some evil stuff and there was a doll there along with other things, I woke up before I did though. Thought it was sketchy..
早川優聖	disappointed :( but who cares... Rip the doll :(
Enikő 91	Why would you burn her if she is hunted? ... i mean i would just sell her of to someone else who is into that kkinda stuff ... you just released the dolls spirit what ever that was ... plus in Colby's video it said it wanted to hurt one of you ... so if the spirit /Demon what ever that it was in the doll is free now ... you guys should be careful ....i dont think its going to thank you for burning its body ... nice video btw .. :)

ExtendoClips	After burning the dybbuk box you still haven’t learned your lesson..

Raven Dragon	Finally you got rid of it. I keeping on seeing her move her eyes
Caboose The Michael J Caboose	Why am I watching this at 3 am?
SuperStormingGamer //MrSSGamer	Jake your an idiot if that was actually the doll calling you it means it has energy to and a mobile phone has a lot of energy THINK ABOUT IT and on Colby's channel the doll said I can't escape Spirits or Demons say this so that you do something bad to it and eventually do something like burn it aka RELEASING IT now the doll if if it evil (sign of when you went to touch it the the doll the fire gets stronger) it will haunt you until a stronger person can get rid of it (some priests) so good luck   Also I have no clue why her wrist has still not burnt maybe cause it's how she died maybe no gasoline I don't know   Also also the fire coming out of its eyes is because it is releasing the spirit    Edit: also when the owner told you to keep it safe  One: otherwise it will hurt you  Two: it was probably a family relative that died or maybe even Murdered!!
Emilia Levin	Love you jake❤️❤️
sam	WHY WOULD YOU BURN IT YOU COULD LVE GIVE IT TO ME ITS NO RIGHT
Cheyenne Hicks	While I was watching this my phone screen went all black it still is but I can still comment

Devon Salina	Look closely at her mouth a 11:20 a bubble comes out her mouth as of its siliva then it pops.  Jake, sam, colby please be careful she could be let free when you burned the doll and might be after you be careful
tiger craft	its a demon the head kept getting on fire every time sam put water on it
Justin Natasmai	This is nightmare fuel
baby chimchim	That was scary
Nienke Mennes	Omg you are all gonna die 😂😂 you should never burn the doll you should have gifted it to a haunted museum to keep it save in there !!!!
# Sam and Colby	The mouth opened slowly.
William Walker	Actually if you burn a Vessel it will not get destroyed it more likely will set Free and it will remember what you have done to her, if you found something haunted in your House again then you know why it happen.
Thad Rose	You destroyed the vessel containing the spirit.  Now the spirt is free. You should have buried it far away from the house keeping it trapped forever away from anyone else. Be ready. It won't be happy if that was truly a  haunted doll.
Sapphire Jeon	what did you jut do? the doll's eyes is fuckin moving and her expression gets darker every minute you put an oil in her face...It's not a good idea..literally not
Tona Matt	Well if this wasn't the creepiest video I've watched tonight, I don't know what was.
Stacey Cano	I’m scared 😱 lmao (*cries*)
zach cc	"except that the eyes are ORANGE????" colby you are colorblind :)
Flap Cat	U know... u burned the doll.. what ablut the spirit inside? If it's free now and in ur house

Katie Kat	I rlly like jake's hair
jasmine !!	*JAKE* burning the doll or any object with a spirit connected to it will not get rid of the spirit attached to the item, it will only let the soul of whoever free. be safe oof
Thea Queen	This is like the boy
Ghost2218 Dragonfirestar	1. Burning the doll just makes it worse.  2. Is it just me or after Colby threw the doll in the pit thing, Jake was putting the camera close  to its face and the eyes were moving....
Sam Hamel	I love how Jake said let's get this to 50,000 likes but when he was using his hands to show the number he did 30
Miss Maddie	4:42 it looks like her eyes move!!
Gothic Fujoshi	Why am I watching this at 11pm? ×-× Now I'm paranoid af. Looks like I'm not getting any sleep tonight👌
Yang Geraldine	i wonder if the dolls in the house communicates. like " yo how did you get in there" "the usual, killed and possessed in the this doll" "man this dress is getting too tight"
Summer May539	I feel like that doll was wearing contacts that doll is flipping creepy if that person new it was dangerous then she would not sell it
Cierra Rose	That was totally that lady calling you!!! She sensed it! I hope you didn't release anything evil!
Shadow Wolfy	Y’all are fucking idiots
spooky spun	So uh...keep us updated on your upcoming haunting I guess? Got a bad feeling about this.

Mia Kashigawa	What would happen if the owner of the doll funds out that's you burned her and tries   to come after you.
Daniel Baehr	F*cking hell dude
Prabhudev Sharma	Why did you burn her fuck!
Britney Joiner	Guys did you see when the doll was laying there on fire with her arms out it looked like a cross
Bunny Angel	You were dumb by burning it. You have released the spirit. Her spirit will haunt you now. You should have taken her to a wiccan shop to know what to do with her.
a_ prettygirl___	You guys should not have done that....
Hope Loves Maze Runner	If me and Jake were siblings 5 years ago.. “MOM!!!! JAKE SET THE LAWN ON FIRE AGAIN!!!”  Mom: “What?!?! HOW?!?!”  Me: “He tried to burn a haunted doll... Mom: ... Jake: “WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT????”
ItWillBeOkayLove	i feel bad for angelica, but if her owner really wanted to keep her safe she shouldnt have sold her in the first place.  Burning dolls that are haunted is dangerous because it releases the spirit captive inside.  I don't commend it as it's dangerous and the toxic gases and chemical released from burning this thing is also dangerous for your guys health as well as bad for the air.  I have a little bit of family history when it comes to haunted dolls, so i'll give u a little info we keep, aside from the dolls hair fibers probably causing the head to burn more.  The soul is thought to stay mainly in the head instead of the heart or chest are where most cultures and folklore have taught it to be in the human body. So...that could be a superstitous reason her head was burning more.  Although im sure there's a clear scientific reason as well.   The doll is considered a vessel just like a human body, your soul cannot leave your body and inhabit another unless you do some sort of crazy ritual or are a master of astral travel..but even in those circumstances, YOU. ALWAYS.HAVE.TO.COME.BACK.TO.THE.SAME.BODY. The only exception to this is death, the ultimatum, you are no longer bound to your vessel or bound to it, and unless you are trapped or cast somewhere or into something, you are generally free to roam for the most part..as a soul that is. The rule is a bit different for no-gooders though, those who do unforgiveable things in waking life, there soul gets heavy and dense, tainted in its own way, its harder for them to have the same amount of control as those who didn't do unforgiveable misdeeds.  Those who say all sins are forgiven..you living a myth , sorry to break it to you.  But after life matters and controlling spirits even removing them from areas or binding them is my tribes specialty and i take great pride in being a half descendant in that.  You burned her vessel so she might be free now..i cant say whether or not she will haunt you guys, or terrorize you, it depends on the amount of energy she holds without a body in all honesty and if she is able to drain energy from you guys to use herself. The doll still wasn't completely burned though..so there is a chance that it hasnt actually been released yet.   In these cases its better to break apart the doll, limb from limb, attach a prayer , or spirit bind to its dismembered head, place in a box and bury deep below as you would a deceased human being.
Jeff Howard	So is everyone buying this cash grab?
Niklas Palicte	Jake what’s your Outro song I need to know
Rita Fernandez	Whyyyy!!! Did I watch this before bed damn it jake 😂 bye bye sleep
Michelle Planko	I’m legit scared for you guys. More for what the former owner will do when she finds out you burned the doll than anything else....the lady gives me such bad vibes, and she now has Jake’s number....I just have a really bad feeling
Ayy Space	Don’t leave Angelica (Me) in the past! Keep me in your present & future!😭💔 (P.s. my name is Angelica🖤)
soupy water	Please be careful jake. By the way. ThAt stuff is scary especially since someone was calling you
Alexandretta Billings	This better be ur last scary video dude u and ur friends could be in danger I dont think u realize this is dangerous and can lead to someone getting hurt or killed I see and hear demons and spirits ik what they can do all of u need to stop messing to with the dead
Ella Stiletto	If you're going to mess around with haunted objects such as dolls and boxes, you should at the very least be respectful and handle them with care. If you're going to get rid of it, make sure you know the best way to do so. Burning haunted things isn't always the go-to.
Siiri Heinonen	If you burn the doll you release the spirit into the world and it will stick to the person or thing who burned it/ where it was burned
Chelsea	Goodbye grandma 🔥
Ella	Can someone tell me why the face and the 1 arm aren’t melted but everything else is...
Sierra Knight	tell me why i've been listening to burnin' up by the jonas brothers all day and jake so happens to pick that song
Lily - Unknown Yt	Haha you call the lady at the start at she doesnt pick up but before that you said it would be 11:00 we she is Haha Jake your funny :'D
Susanna Hansen	*sees title* NO S*IT SHERLOCK
Heyyy Reyes	Just got done watching Kevin Hart and I came home to watch this and now I can’t sleep 🙃
BearingtonTradingCompany	I can't believe they would burn her. That's incredibly disrespectful. All I felt from her was immense sadness, anger sure, but holy crap the sadness. You didn't even have a conversation with the woman. You should have at least heard her out before trying to destroy the doll. You didn't even fully destroy her so whatever is trapped is still there.  Edit: At 4:40 put it at 0.25 speed and you can see her pupils adjust.
Crimsen rayne	I'm honestly really disappointed about this video..it's super disrespectful to Angelica and the girl that sold it to you guys..I hope you guys don't get hurt..  I may be taking this video to seriously but seeing her burn made me want to cry.
Hailey Mueller	BURNING a HAUNTED doll is not cool dude not cool thats mean cause basicle your BURNING the SOLE
Wolf Leader	Where'd Colby get his hoodie?
Cole Ann	I loved that doll 😒🙁 but also that’s a dumb idea
Gwyn Reiman	i love you Jake but that was a BIG mistake, i have a haunted doll myself and i would never want to harm her, if she scared me or not. this spirit might be a bad one, but she was in a vessel. i felt sad watching her burn, her spirit is now released but she was probably happier in the vessel. spirits fade when not in vessels. please never do this again Jake.
Icy Waterfall	Jake Y’all did wrong by Angelica. You should’ve donated her to one of the haunted museums like Zak Baggins in Las Vegas or something ... or at least waited till the lady got back with you on her back story !
Hannah LueWho	Is it just me or did her arm slightly move at 5:55?!
yo GIRL estefany! we lit Llamas	Wait she had orange eyes?!?! But I see pink its weird
DemonBoy -	I'm actually mad that y'all burned the doll, she honestly didn't seem that bad until yall started f*cking with her.
FreakzRitual	I'm thinking burning the doll might of released the spirit.. So now he is stuck with it.. I was also thinking if he didn't want the doll. He could of given the doll back.. She said keep the doll safe.. He clearly didn't...
Megan B	This is so disrespectful to the lady who sold the doll to Reggie. Especially since she said to take care of her.
JesseLoves Carbs	Ya funny cunt. Hope she isn't haunting the fuck outta you, Elton, Sam, Corey and Colby :/ aaaaaaaaaah fuck that shit
Aine Hughes	I shouldn’t of watched this at 11 o’clock at night I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight
Abby W	A little after 4:40 when Jake puts the camera on Angelica, her pupils dilate for a split second......
Rian Limpach	The eyes look pink
Isabella A’	Colby: Her Eyes Are Orange  Me: Looks at the doll and thinks: That’s Pink... 🤦🏻‍♀️😹
Jennifer Novella	I saw Colby’s video first and it was creepy how weird things were happing as they had the doll right next to them , and then Jake burns the doll not knowing what’s going to happen 🙃 please jake be safe that wasn’t a good idea ...
Alice Valdez	Yo Jake man I have a feeling that what you Sam and Colby did was very bad. Please stay safe guys and always be alert with that doll being burned could bring bad news. Love y'all's vids but this was freaky. Just stay safe 😎
Hannah Shuler	You burned the vessel. Not the entity
Jordan Troyer	this gives me the heebeejeebees
Joy Arnette	that lady is gonna be pissed, and you're gonna be super haunted now
rukiagirl19	honestly i just wanted to take care of that doll as soon as i seen her, i hope its soul rest easy after that burning
Kibuni	You’re all psychopaths lmao
makayla misses niall	jake, i really dont think you should’ve done that..
*The Pansexual Pocky Stick That is Named Pan*	jake *no*
Mary	bro even THE Sam Golbach, guy who does every haunted exploration and 3am challenge, won’t hold Angelica. that’s when you know something’s really scary.
Stephanie Brock	Jake I love u guys but... *ur such dumbasses* lol jkjk but srsly Ik u guys aren’t rlly religious so u should hav second thoughts on that and hire an experienced priest. Or go to church at least. U need to bless the house. Colby doing ouji and *bringing* the spirits back home, Sam *inviting* spirits in with rituals, and u, Jake *releasing* spirits their trapped for a reason ._.
Lindsey Hensley	Some Youtubers are going ham for Halloween. Jack Weeber out here going for a full thanksgiving dinner.
Derpy Dino Gaming	At  11: 27  When jake zooms into the eyes... look at the right eye... what is that?
Christina Petrin	"I bet that f****** doll's doin it" 😂😂
Jjlove1056	This is why i watch these right when they come out not 11 at night on a school night😂😂
FarBeyondGalaxies 22	Burning things releases the spirits and shit in it? So you let it loose in your house? Why?
Kitty Max	When you burn a vessel you release the spirit to do whatever it wants.
Taylor091096	JAKE, what did we say about burning haunted shit...!
Maddi V	just after 11:42 HER ARMS MOVED
Tara Delaney	Jake omg 🤦🏼‍♀️
Effys World	Jake I think you've just make a big mistake lovely. Not only have you just released that spirit but when the lady who sold it to your brother finds out what you just did... She's not gonna be pleased. All round you've made a bad decision and I hope it doesn't come back to bite you on the ass. Stay safe ok?❤️
DeviNNoisE	You're such a pyromaniac wow.
kissy_george kissy_george	Do you one man hide and seek do one man hide and seek
Kali Ander	I can't believe so many people are dumb enough to be worried about him burning the doll 🤦. It's just a doll there are no evil spirits
Panic! at the 21 pilots chemical fall out	Jake. I love you. But your fECKed now. *F E C K E D* .
Tia T.	Shoudve answer  the first call lol
Brennan Revere	Im not usually the type to get scared over these and i live on the other sidevof the united states and im scares u boys better stay safe!❤️
Grayson	I just googled what it means when an unavailable number calls you. It means that the number calling you is being placed outside of where your phone service can receive the actual number so it couldn't have been the woman who sold it to Reggie and it couldn't have been a friend trying to prank you because both would be within reach for your phone service to recognize the numbers. The phone rang each time you tried to put out the fire. I, personally don't think that's a coincidence because once the fire was put out, the strange number stopped calling. I don't think this is over Jake, so I wish you good luck.
sarah geddes	She was a beautiful doll
Terry Navarre	No why
Mitzi What?	You poor boys are so dumb. You're gonna learn though. I hope this video was a set up, because if it wasn't, you all are so fucked.
Anthony Melvin	First comment on any of your stuff... Havent you herd of not burning a ouji board cause it will leave a portal open for the demon? You think this is different?
NayNay Steele	Colby is a sociopath and I love it 💕
Lexi Pinto	I seriously hate the fact that Colby’s in these, like Jake has proven to not give a fuck about MANY things. Especially these, but Colby was always the one to be very cautious and now he’s fucking around with this doll and burning the thing? Making sexual jokes like really???
Gracie Acheson	So I'm not sleeping. I hate dolls
Spade Of Cards	You just fucked yourselves over man
Nayeli	Ima have nightmares.
bunny cake	You guys are going to get haunted while you are already are but still you guys are probably I am not trying to scare you but when you mess with demonic things that have bad intentions they attend to possess people that you don't know they are possessed or take form of a different person that you think that's at the person but they're really not that person there's somebody else and there's trapped in astral projection astral projection realm and you know hope you guys be safe because you playing with fire right now like very bad fire to never burned a doll I can feel that something bad is going to happen
Paphitchaya Saksaowapak	her pupils tho, went big and back to small 4:42
Olivia Da Silva Moore	I know this isn't very important right now but.. JAKE! YOUR HAIR!😀 Does it randomly change colour?? Edit: Jesus, if the person that sold it found out that you did that tho, 😦
Grace Machado	Don't mind me, just digging your grave
cami	u guys are dumb afff
OreoMonster951	Bro, you should've just sent it back to the lady. I'm scared for you guys. You gotta be careful with that kinda thing.
Synnovea Dhanipersad	Y'all need to cleanse your souls after that holy crap dude.
Isabella Nelson	if feel like wherever the doll is it's always looking at me and it's fucken creepy as
marshall mondou	You just released the spirit completely into our realm you fucking dumbass
Tara Hughey	I was actually terrified that entire video
Anna Sherlock	This is probably the scariest video I have seen and I’m and being 100% honest about this lol
Ghostwolf	Why tf did you guys burn the fuckin doll you guys possibly just released a spirit that will possibly try to kill you now and plus that lady said keep it safe there is something that she wanted safe or didn't want to get released out of there... i love you guys but this is stupid lol

lil sprite	burning the doll wasn't a good idea. you might have just released whatever was in that doll.
Edward Niles Klawitter	Im not an expert on these types of things but, when you burn something that could have a spirit in it wouldnt you realese it by burnning it? Idk but please be safe about what you do.       Love ya❤ EDIT: (as i was writing "please be safe" when i went to type "suffer" for the word "safe". And it kinda freaked me out
kyrsten Pack	When jake started blowing on the fire it made my ears actually hurt cause I was wearing headphones with the volume all the way up 😂

Hannah Seddon	уσυя fυ¢кє∂ вяσ....
Rae 45	ew at 4:40 it looks like the pupils are moving💀
c mal	6:29 does anyone realize that it looks like her eyes are glowing?  and at 7:13, like Sam said, her eyes are orangish white. also, at 7:19, you can see them go black, and at 7:34 is when we can see for ourselves that they actually went black. ONE OF HER ARMS ISN'T EVEN BURNING
Remogr Person	My phone literally sucks with notifications 🙁 but at least I’m watching it now🙃🙂Also hi jake
Alejandra M	Did Colby say bye to it before ya burned it? He didn't do It...
Momo Chan	To be honest I'm not sure if I  want to like this vid... it's just too creepy... and it's 3:21 AM ( and I'm terrified😄) sooo I'm just not gonna like it sorry Jake 😔

Emma Carpenter	So like....are you going to tell the lady you burned the doll??
koala june	I cried when you hurt her IDK why  Ik she's a doll but something about her just seems calmer ik I'm not making sense  But that's wrong dude so wrong you hurt an innocent soul  I really wish she isn't hunted omg she must've been scared & in pain
Ally M	Your fucked Dude.
animelover 277	Look jake...i know you were doing this for the video but you should not have done that,I haven't researched or know exactly what happens after you burn the doll but I think something really bad will happen....i love you but...this was a stupid idea.
horsegirl love	Holy shit that was scary  the thing is like the devil's kid if he even has one that was scary and sorry for my mouth
Noob101	When the dolls head wouldn’t go out I started shaking like crazy
CrypticCats	Spooky
Crissy Mae	What is with you and burning stuff? I wish I told you sooner that I wanted the doll. I would have fixed her up and kept her safe. She was a pretty doll and she could have been worth a lot if she was fixed up and taken care of better. So sad 😞
cheryle chia	im so-. do you really have no more content?

Evelin Gonzalez	Honestly U should’ve waited to hear her background before you did anything and I love scary videos but you’re going too far with these videos yeah it makes content but it’s real and u needa stop messing with it before u regret it
Nemesia Rodriguez	i was so spooked:0
Tapainga Walker	I do not approve of this....you don't even have proof that its an evil spirt, that was a dick move you and the others did, plus you didnt even care about texting or calling the dolls owner to tell them. Like you could have just sent it away if you didn't want it.
BIDL Macy Nguyen	When someone called Jake and didn't say anything, I was thinking: " THE HASHSLINGINGSLASHER! " Idk how to spell it 💀👹
Michelle Jimenez	“i have the receipts sis” -jake   new favorite quote 😂🖤
Rosie// Subliminals	BURNING A HAUNTED DOLL (BAD IDEA)   Because setting a possessed doll on fire could go a right way

Torieplayz Nothing	Jakes mind* -keep Angelica safe-  *Burn Angelica*
Bunny Kookies	Is it weird that I find the doll cute??? No? Okay
r u b e l l e	[ FORGIVE MY BAD ENGLISH, ITS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE KSAKL ]  y'know jake..  the soul inside anjelica/angelica whatever it is, well.. guess what? of course you don't know well, let me tell you,  the soul inside that doll is still staying with you all, it won't leave you. this isn't the end jake, she's still staying, you didn't release her soul out of the doll, you didn't ask for an expert's help, and her soul can possess anyone; dog, your roommates and your other dolls/stuff toys and etc..  she's mad and she won't stop, she will get revenge, be careful and now, she will be stronger and angrier at all of you  and now, my theory is.. maybe the soul inside angelica was/used to be depressed, maybe the one who you bought it from was her mother/etc.. and also, i think that..  when she was human; she got so depressed and decided to cut/slit her wrist and probably the cut was so deep that one of her veins was cut- the vein that was connected to the/her heart and it killed her. and maybe it stayed there because she's trying to tell how she died or how one of you will die, well the seller was calling jake while you were burning the doll right? i think she got suspicious that "jake's brother" suddenly messaged her out of the blue and felt that he was lying, or maybe she followed colby from home and saw colby with angelica and saw the 3 of you burning her, and maybe she called while you burned the doll 'cuz she knows that once she calls you; you will stop since you will get scared, all i know  is angelica won't stop haunting you all, and you might get scary nightmares
Fandom Goddess	I have no idea why but the intro with him just saying hey with the sweatshirt is so funny to me lmao. It's like me at parties
Aubrey Paige	I believe that if you burn a haunted object you release the spirit and allow it to move on. But this doll was not completely burned, you need to finish that bitch.
Jennifer Bergeron	BAD IDEA GUYS! Plz stay safe🙏
Weepy Tea	I wish they had sold her somewhere, so what if the spirit wasn't nice. How would you feel if after you died you possessed something and it was broken or burned?
PatrickStarsMomma	4:48 Colby's giggle <3
Jessa McGuire	Why did watch this at 11:00 and I think that Colby is a rapist know that what he did to the doll and I know is so triggering to someone me too because it happens to me 😞
the_beauty_of_logic_yt	Jake u fucked up so bad. If it we're me I would sell it or take care of it and make peace. Not burn it cause you can't burn a lost soul so all u did is anger and realise it.
moon meow	I hope Colby chooses to be more respectful to things that are more than likely very connected to a spirit. If he seriously wants to start practicing Wicca, he NEEDS to have more respect. Smh. I'm sure one day he'll come across a spirit who will happily teach him a lesson on respect. Hopefully he doesn't start worshipping a God or Goddess that is big on karma. I'll keep him in my thoughts...
Lps Makenna	I saw her hand catch on fire but it still disnt burn and out of the whole body of the doll eyes are either to fall oit safely or stay put in the socket
princess tay	Love the outro music scary to hype😅
Sarina Hansen	Y'all are idiots...you never do this scary stuff the right way and it's so annoying.
Brieana Bott	It was definitely her. You need to get an actual priest to come and see what's going on. That or get someone to put a protection spell on you guys and the place y'all live at.
Halbug and Allison	Dudee this was not a good idea. Burns things like this realases whatever spirit in the doll which could be a bad spirit. I be very careful please Jake....
Emily Smith	Okay at 4:42 I swear the dolls pupils moved
Siobhan Davenport	Wait how they going to explain to the owner they burned her
Kira 1308	I feel bad for the doll :( what if Angelica really went through something horrible like that and them u put her through another horrible thing :( and i rly hope you didn’t set her spirit free because in colby’s video, Angelica wanted to harm you guys. Please stay safe!!
Steph14	When it ignited at 9:44 it went bright and immediately was gone, it stopped burning almost as if whatever spirit was in there was getting out and when it stopped burning it was as if there was nothing in there anymore
Maycee_Ann	Andddd...now I can't sleep 😭
Brianna Ribeiro	im having an anxiety attack kkhh-
Frankie Bloodshed	I love you guys.... you guys need to stop doing this dumb shit, y’all could really fuck things up for yourselves. Don’t take this as a hate comment, I’m actually concerned for you guys!
Averie Switzer	This is fucking scary😰
Meghan St. John	I love your hair!!!
•Spooky Zo•	Each time jake put the camera on the doll the doll’s mouth open a little bit each time
abby broughton	Omg I love colby
MarSadie Edwards	bad idea
Beo abdurrhman	Did Colby just 4:01 lmao 😂
jamie_9	0:52 this is why I love Jake💗😂
_katelyn_	4:44 the facial expressions were ok but when it goes to 5:35 I think it changed unless it’s just me
Rylee Stewart	Can we please get a curse word count 😂 That would be so funny tbh
Auburn Schmidt	Keep us updated if you get possessed or whatever
skyla josey	WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK! see this is why you don't mess with haunted things
Lexington Imbraguglio	(EVERYONE MAKE SURE THE ROOMMATES SEE THIS)[screenshot it and send it to them on Instagram or Twitter] The spirit is still trapped because the doll wasn't burned to ashes. The doll was clunking to keep them away from it so it would burn then it called to get them to worry about who was calling, and when they were putting it out the flame kept getting worse so it would scare them and try to force them to leave it alone. The spirit is still trapped because it's not fully burned to a crisp only a part of it is free not all of it. JAKE DO NOT BURN THE REST OF THAT DOLL. The spirit is using the doll as a conduit or as a vessel if you free it, it can and will possess the weakness person in that house or attach itself to one of you just like it did that lady in Kansas that's why she is so worried about it because she has a direct connection to it. That lady is going to call sometime the day after all this happened and she is going to know what you did Jake. BE CAREFUL
Star Power	I liked both videos at the beginning. The content is better than Red Dead Redemption 2
Maddy Storm	yeah you're right this was a bad idea jake you let her free and she wants to kill you and the roomates. Yes. She was a human at one point obvioulsy. and this was probably her favorite thing she owned if she took care of it and then later possesed it and you just burnt it. Jake thats messed up and you most likely made her more mad then she already was. i would have given her to someone that would acually care for her and someone she liked. bless your soul. 💚💚
tater tot	No lie Jake the doll seemed like it was trying to tell you guys something I mean it kept popping as you got close which you could've angered the spirit and the head kept igniting so the spirit is mad also burning that doll just set the spirit/demon free
Elise Keehan	Is it just me or did I feel bad for the doll.  Like something was attached to it.  Jake this was a bad idea 😟
Alex C	BRING BACK THE PRANK WARS😭💩  You should’ve played one man hide and seek before haha
Sabrina Ladd	I’m seriously wondering if it’s entirely possible to exercise a possessed doll, like a possessed human...I’m gonna look it up
Amy Sirawsky	I had a bad feeling when I read your title. I think this was a mistake. I’m not sure if the spirit in that doll was good or bad, but I don’t think it could hurt you if you treated it right, like the woman said. Now that you burnt it, I just feel like something bad is going to happen. If you didn’t want it in the house, there are plenty of people who would be glad to take her. People who know more about this than you. You should do the mirror game again with Sam and Colby to see if she’s attached to any of you
boos123	You should tell the lady you burn the doll and see what she say to you about it
Chelsea Moon	That was weird when it’s head started igniting when u tried to put it out. Also after what the owner told u, u chose to burn the doll... what if she called u to check on her. Good luck😭
Beyya DiCaprio	U guys r such idiots why did u do that the only flipping thing that didn’t flipping burn was he slit wrist
Mariel Henderson	Your going to die my lord 😂😂😂 RIP Jake
STRICT _ SHENANIGANS	JAKE YOU RE SUCH A DUMBASS OHMygODDDDD YOU SHOULDVE WAITED TO B URN THE DOLL TILL THE LADY TOLD YOU HER BACKSTOry BRO OH NOOOoo
andrea beltran	i am scaerd to like this vid ssrry i am NOT going to
LizardQueenie	Stay safe
Arkham 703	Try burning the rest of the doll otherwise the thing the spirit was "latched" to wasn't technically burnt. That's what I would do if people disagree say
Rn Tn	Come on guys quit forgetting to hit the 👍 button! This crazy bunch is great!
Claire	What was that popping when they were by the fire
Julia LeBlanc	In Colbys Video the doll said it wanted to hurt them....If you burn the doll isn't setting the dolls sprite free? There dead for sure        Jk Jk 💙😅
Evelyn Gonzalez	Umm sir, why?! Lol
Cla zrma	I think you need 1 more fire where you actually make sure every body part gets in! Be safe Jake!
Chyynia Reeder	@5:53 it's mouth started to bleed😱
Grace M	Honestly I love Angelica the eyes are so pretty and there’s something so esthetically   pleasing about the dolls creepiness idek
Emma Grape	I'm watching this at midnight in pitch black on a school night alone. Wish me luck
Maryam That Artist Fab	Didt the woman you got it from said to...oh idk, KEEP IT SAFE? That thing’s gonna haunt you....
Samantha Exists	To put out a fire you don't blow on it when it's that big you're basically just helping it to be larger. Have you ever seen somebody blow on coals to make them light? It's because oxygen helps feed the fire. You either put water or dirt on it to make it stop.
jeanne maclennan	YOU SHOULDNT HAVE DONE THAT
lovablewolf 1	You shouldn't have done this. Who set it on fire? She was trying to call Colby's phone, right? This video was the dumbest Idea you have ever done, the girl that was haunting the doll, she was trying to contact you guys when the phone went off, If it was Colby's phone, Colby, I am sorry, I have to do it. If it was sam's phone of Jakes phone, your fine. I have been keeping track of you haunted videos And all the paranomal stuff, and the stuff that you have been targeted on. You hurt her, I dont want to scare you Colby, but....your the taget, she wants revenge, he....want revenge.
Specer Payseno	Oh my fucking God are you serious
Sydney Androsuk	Omg you're so stupid sometimes. You are putting the whole house in danger
Infinity Derp	Why do I always end up watching these types of videos at night
Kyra	How could you burn the doll when the owner gave it to you so you could protect it like wtf thats messed up
Victoria Zamora	Y'all crazy🤦
Jenny’s World	With all the stuff that’s been happing in the house I swear you guys don’t need no more spirits attached Jake burning the doll doesn’t solve the problem it makes it only worse !!
Warrior Wolf	jake gonna die rip jake
Raspberry Tea 663	I love your hair!!!   It honestly looked like the whole time you were planning to burn or started to burn it it started to move even the mouth looked like it moved a little, why do you like burning evil satanic things!!
ExploringForward	I’m gonna have a nightmare about the doll now! 🙁
Sarena Maynard	Is Colby that desperate for a girlfriend that he HUMPS the doll what the freak she said keep the doll safe and he is over here humping her and then throwing her face first smack into the fire pit!🤣
Genuine Happiness	*singing happily* 🎵🎼I'M A SOCIOPATH!🎼🎵

Maggie Breeden	You. Messed. Up. I wish you the best of luck jake.
Skull !	I SWEAR TO GOD THE DOLL'S FACE  CHANGED.... 😓😓😓😓😓😓
Psychosister101	This spirit is going to reak havoc now that you released it jake
Blade Lord	1) Solby trash emo boi # 1  gets rid of creepy doll in the most "heartwarming" way possible  2) Colby should've thrown some sage in the campfire, Now he's gonna need to burn a pick-up truck worth of the stuff.  3)The former owner is going to be steamed.  4)Jake is gonna get possessed or worse, the spooky things would hardly do anything to Colby and Sam has the Midnight Man,. (The Haunting of Jake Webbers body - coming to theaters this oct 31st. its gonna be so lit)
Daphne The Angel	Before you burnt her,  her mouth was open.  At the end it was half closed.
Grace .G	“She kept texting him is Angelica ok? Like a WEIRDO”😂👏🏻
TheSmolBoi 07	Dang it jake you shouldve set a motion camera infront of it for a day so that we can see what happened MISSED OPPORTUNITY
Cookie Dragon [CD]	Guys. I love you, Jake, Aaron, Colby, Sam, Corey, etc. Etc. But...WHY!? WHY DO YOU STILL DO THIS SHIT?! Like you’re awesome. BUT GOD DAMNIT!
Bekah Rat	This genuinely just made me so sad and uncomfortable because haunted or not this was someone’s belonging who obviously wanted it to be safe and in one piece not to mention she was a nice looking doll and idk that was someone’s at one point and it meant a lot to them
ChillyFan	You guys are idiots full on morons
Romeo Miranda	I actually feel bad for the doll... Couldn't you just return it instead of burning it?

Merdith Campbell	It’s weird, I wanted to help the doll and stop y’all from burning her and then when it shows close up shots of her, it made me want to cry! No joke. I don’t know why but I felt so bad for her.
DiaboilkGaming	11:27 u can see like an eye looking at the doll so creepy

Chloe Alexis	THIS WAS CRAZYYYYYY!!!!!!! TALK ABOUT SPOOKYYY
Pickle Waifu	This is why you din’t burn haunted dolls... or buy haunted dolls... Just don’t have dolls, they’re creepy.
Taylor Brigance	If Jake or anyone else in that house dies... what the hell am I gonna do with my life.
Ella Decorso	Damn dude I woulda bought her
Sara Moncayo	i think maybe the doll was some kind of robot or at least had some electronic device in her head...maybe a camera? thatd be weird haha but maybe that is why it was popping and also..the way the owner would have known and called you...that...or the doll is really haunted and i dont know how the owner knew :o
Melati Salma	JAAAAKEEEEEEE WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Turtle Lord	"I don't know how else we're gonna get rid of it." BITCH SEND HER BACK!!! Also since everything has been already been sent to hell you might as well burn that hand to because this could be like that one part in Choraline where the other mother's hand was left over and that hand still had life in it
Peachy Queens	Jake jake JAKE why THE HECK WOULD U BURN HER!!! U COULD OF LIKE pUT IT TO A ANTIQUE SHOP OR SOMETHING
Bunny girl only	I don't know if it my eyes messing with me but it look like her arms move and she seems anger and worried or sad I don't know

Beca Stevenson	Guy's I Think You Should Just Burn The House Down At This Point! Guaranteed You Have Demons If Not Really Evil Trickster Spirits In Your House!

Jenna North	Dude that doll has creeped me out for the past few videos but idk if this was the best idea I mean 1: if its haunted you probably just released its spirit into your house and it may just get worse and 2: if it's not that lady is still gonna get hella pissed! Idk man this just seems lowkey wrong maybe you should've just given it away like she did
cheerskiitten kitty	Loved the video loads it made me smile loads and we all love you very much no matter what you do.
Adrianna Sims	Whoever called you had to *67 before they dialed

Marika Taylor	You shouldn't have done that jake
Meg Foreman	I watched this right before I went to bed, I hate myself
Marissa Jay	Y’all need some Jesus
Queen Weird	This is so ypu shouldn't ever burn haunted things. It releases the spirt and it makes it unhappy. Dont burn haunted things
Bree Rose	Alrighty roo. So because you don’t know what kind of entity was attached to the doll, it wasn’t the best idea to burn it, because if there’s a dark entity attached, you just burned the vessel it was contained in or connected with, which can release the entity so you (worst case scenario) could’ve screwed yourself and the roommates.
Bailey Holloway	Im watching this at night at 9:40 it's doesn't seem that scary but it is  Because I've already started this video and now I have to go to the bathroom  The scariest thing is I have to go outside so in the dark alone with no light freezing :T
mari sanchez	am i the only one that sees neon purple eyes? i don’t see orange??

Sarah Cupcake Lala Land	Me: *yelling at my phone* "WHY WOULD BURN A DOLL!!" Also me: "oh what the hell! I would of throw it on the trash!"
RosesofVersailles	....Where did you come up with the idea of *_burning_* the doll being a good idea?
Harley Shepherd	JAKE I LOVE YOU BUT WHYYYYY WOULD YOU BURN IT 😂 it's scary what if whatever is attached to it ends up haunting the house. And Colby justtt, cleansed the house. Hahahaha that sucksss bro
Nunya Bizness	You really need to get that dolls ashes away from your house now or things will go very wrong. I know some one who has delt with some slight thing like that. Trust me on this one. I will haunt your until you do something.

Unknown Grudge	You just angered them, also disrespected them.. I should be very careful if I were you...
Keekee Xox	If you burn an item which a spirit is attached to. The spirit will most likely attach itself to a near by item, person or place. Burning items which carry spirits is so dangerous man😫 ya’ll will never learn will ya😂😂😂😂
Cat Rodriguez	Dude am I the only one that buys haunted stuff an try the same things as Jake lol
Umi Echo	Hope you guys will be okay after doing that if I was you i'd be watching my every step
Dilara Caki	please do a second part of this video, like did anything happened after that? did the lady called or said anything after you burned the doll? i'm kinda into this haunted situations at the house haha.
Megan Scott	There's this stuff called "Dark Energy" out in space.  It interacts with stuff in space but we can't see it.  And there is no way that it can be contained just in space.  So maybe it's affecting all the "haunted" stuff
Loki	That was a really really bad move to burn it on your property or burning it at all good luck with that mighta wanted to ask the red book what the outcome woulda been first
Adriana Molina	Bro love your new hair🙏🙏🙏
Irah zuzu	Can I still keep you in my closet Jake😀
Infle ctiun	You’re so fucken cute 😍💕
Fighting Angel	I’m watching this at 9:00 so perfect timing for the video :) and yeah…I have creepy dolls that sit on the shelf beside me. I sleep near them and I’m terrified of those dolls. Anyways, burning it can actually bring the spirit’s demon out and can be free to reincarnate to be attached to another time or a being. I actually had a major nightmare form those dolls and this was  after I touched one after a few months, but it fell down from a storm. It was complicated to say and confusing, but it kept saying I made Anna or some name that started with a J or F mad…there is a lot more, but if u want me to say about it I will
CNCOwner/ Martinator/Child of God	4:42 or somewhere there I swear that F**KING pupil moved I'm not even joking 😱😱
Sara Garcia	Jake dm me I know why it was doing that

Alexandra Balcazar	Normally when you post videos of you burning supposedly haunted shit I’m pretty indifferent to it, but this video gave me seriously bad vibes... you shouldn’t have done that dude
Music N3rd	Ohhh...My....Gosh...WHY WOULD YOU BURN IT? YOU JUST PUT YOURSELF IN MORE DANGER, JAKE. Ppl best hit that like button after all of this.

Pia Alzira Roa	Did you know if you burn a doll that has a spirit inside it. It will now haunt you because the spirit is already free.
Montzerrat Arellano	Doesn't the doll remind you of the movie The Boy. I think ima do some research if I have time.
Gracieee K	I love jake's hair .. And I'm late again ..
Abby Smith	Aaahh this freaks me out!! Please be careful ♥
Carmela Coursen	The music Intensifying as they were putting out the fire gave me so much anxiety but love you Jake. Please stay safe ❤️
Hailey Alsbaugh	jit said “for 50k likes” YET HE PUT UP 3 FINGERS 😭😭
Jay is trying her best	This video actually made me uncomfortable and I usually don't feel uncomfortable from this stuff. It's because it's a doll I swear
BTS FAN 4 LIFE	*_WELP THE DOLL_*
Jenna Marie	you shouldn’t have burned it jake :(
Nine YT	It's 2.30am when I'm watching this and I'm scared as hell....... I love scary videos but that was too much for me......
Keila Davila	Jake the doll gives me the creeps ode
Savannah Ya Girl	421st 😋🤞🏻
testube66	Omg terrifying
ameisha ganggg	I love Jake so much
Jpeli10	Omg at 7:52 at the top right of the fire place there is to stick hands that move really fast
HyunGi Kim	The doll's burnt face scares me. For a sec there I thought her mouth is moving 😅
Alayshia Rivera	dude you literally. like. your literally just screwed your selves. That like saying I'm going to burn the ouija board. you just let whatever spirit was in there free. it was trapped for a reason. God have mercy on your souls.
Melissa Fletcher	the doll almost looks like it’s either going to come back to life or kill u guys
Jay B	did anyone see the thing in the dolls eyes like after they burn it plz tell me someone did see the creepy thing in the dolls eyes
Yemili Cruz	At 4:42 the dolls pupils get bigger and then get smaller
Amanda Blake	Colby is color blind.  Silly Angelica's eyes are purple
Bobbie Houser	Okay this was a lot creepier than I thought it was going to be
XxrobloxmoodxX	I wanna know why Colby is the most inappropriate person in the trap house? Plus at 4:42 it looks like the pupils are moving. Also when you burnt the fall and the eyes changed colors that mostly mean the soul is leaving the body. I know freaky right?
Cody Ragan	You should have recorded it moving
Catherine Bolding	wait you know how like 666 is the devils number and if you call it you can come in contact with a spirit? maybe it's not ANGELICA but ANGIE the girl that died. and MAYBE her arm  didn't ignite because you didn't put anything on it... MAYBE her eyes changed because of  flames.  i believe in this stuff and don't think you can just light stuff on fire. but i have no hate towards you or sam or colby, i'm jut naming the things that caught my attention and trying to  give it an explanation.  and i'm worried about your safety. because you're letting demons  of all sorts into your house. i'm still surprised as to why you would take her from the dead people place( i don't know what it's called) LOVE YOU <3 <3 <3 <3 BE SAFEEEEEEE   sorry it's so long and you came down here just to read this little sentence!!!!

They LoveTatum	Uwu 💀💀💀👀👀👀‼️‼️‼️
Kaz Winters	We already know it’s haunted so what the hell jake?😂
paranoia.syndicate	everyone is like "NO DON'T BURN THE DOLL YOU'LL DIEEEE!" my religion says believes that burning haunted items (including ouija boards) are supposed to be burnt until there's nothing left. it's the safest way to dispose of the item. the demon(s) that posses the item left and do not usually cling to you. however, if they do then you must have your entire house blessed and you must carry protection with you at all times until you feel 100% safe.

Jack shadow123	It was100% the fucking doll calling you, how fast it called back seems like what was trying to call you was angry. I got a feeling you guys fucked up that doll is the only thing that has gotten me worried just from looking at it out of all the things you guys have done.
