You‚Äôll also have to trade psycho all of your hats from your inventory. But you have to be quick, so that The Heavy can capture the intelligence and win the game for all of you epic gamers.

Elliot	This man, I once could say I had great respect for.  He has called upon me in the past, and I have answered eagerly.  I have given him my house.  My wife.  My first born son.  All in efforts to obtain the enemy intelligence.  But this?  The final straw on the already much overburdened camel‚Äôs back.  I have thought much on this, and believe I am able to definitively say: as he sits there, eating his sandvich and occasionally pressing the right two buttons in order to spam pootis, this man plots against us all.  I will no longer support him in his efforts to obtain the enemy intelligence.  Mommy always told me: ‚ÄúSon, in the event that you are presented with a dilemma which involves completing the objective by way of great self sacrifice but those who gave their promise do not deliver, you must take matters into your own hands, swing wildly at everything that moves, assume anything could be a spy, and when you are clear of doubt, turn to your hoovy teammate and state:  ‚Äòmy good sir, if you are unable to capture the intelligence while ubered, kritzkreiged, and supported by your scout, you are undeserving of my full support.‚Äù  I have never forgotten those exact words, and today I will follow by their meaning.  Heavy from Team Fortress 2, you have asked too much of me, one man, and have therefore discredited yourself in my eyes.  I will no longer support your consistently futile efforts to capture the enemy intelligence, and I will not give you my strange Ghostly Gibbus, it is mine and I will guard it with my life.  Likewise I will for my Club Penguin account password.  Thus concluded my official statement to the Heavy from Team Fortress 2.   Pls like and subscribe, and follow me on my social media, links are in the description.  Wanna join my gift card giveaway?  Just send the last three digits of the number on the back of your credit card to this email address:  definitelynotHeavyfromTf2@hotmail.com  For free shipping and handling, please send me your home address and social security number.

Kool n√£osei	The fact that some people here posted their real credit card info (some are fake and others are expired... Please tell me they were expired) on the internet clearly shows that kids shouldn't be allowed on youtube.      The very fact that you placed your real credit card info publicly shows how retarded you are to not understand that this is a joke.    Oh and btw, a heavy? Carrying intel?!  Why would one do even that as a mental challenge to begin with? He's the slowest character of them all and he's pretty much vulnerable to everything.  Not to say that you also suffer a movement penalty when carrying intel so good fucking luck bringing in that intel to your base as heavy.     Also, TF2 isn't a cancernite ripoff game. TF2 existed waay longer than that garbage that looks like puke combined with micro-transactions.
