Xephonia	I appreciate that their is a pre applied screen protector. Do we know if it is tempered glass or plastic?
TheHvk	y'all are here bitching about the headphone jack lmao. I haven't used a headphone jack in years and I have some  random cheapo phone. Get an anker bluetooth headset for $25 and be done with it.
Wrongthink Machine	>end of 2018 >people still don‚Äôt have Bluetooth headphones
gymratmagoo54	What will yall ever do when samsung and lg ditch the headphone jack.
luton ian	Unother nail in oneplus coffin
reshi p	That notch looks worse than the iphone x lol
FyWhy	I was looking to upgrade from htc one m8 to oneplus 6t but since there is no headphone jack i'll wait some more.
Henny Roggy	Good and informative video :)
Vishal Singh	7 minutes long ad
AlphaCodexx197	The notch on this device looks better than all of the other devices with a notch... Even the essential phone. It looks almost futuristic if that makes any sense. If I had to have a phone with a notch, I'd say this one is probably the most tolerable
Kavya Balchandani	I got the onepluse 6t ad as i clicked on this video
Gibran A	No headphone jack? Guess that means 1+ is getting -1 sales this year from me
tonebonetones	Notches are just terrible, and spoil the aesthetics and the visual lines of display with this annoying, cheap fix feature.  Samsung is about to show you how it should be done. ....again.   Hopefully, this time the penny will drop and even Linus will concede accepting the awful notch was not one of his better moves.
Wickedpowerupguy	Looks like OnePlus actually knows how to price Thier phones sensibly *cough* Apple, Samsung, Google *cough*
Sebastian Lindner	I have a problem with my oneplus 6T Phone Calls and Whatsapp calls are okay but if i send a voice message in Whatsapp it is very silent so i have to hold the oneplus 6T very very close to the mouth, that my friend can hear my voice message. On my old iPhone I can hold the Phone 30cm away while talking
J C	You don't have to say goodbye to wired headphones just use the dongle they provide
Colton Mandell	Linus looking like a real hugh hefner here.
Javier Hernandez	No 3.5mm jack I'm about to give them a 9mm brap. The fuck did they remove that.
TheRockNinja1	I don't really like the review being sponsored like this...
Peerless Records	did he rly say 'condom type case' xD paha lmao
Ysmael Dauz	I still like One plus even tho they got rid of the headphone jack. I'm more of a wireless person to begin with just because I'm usually always doing some type of physical activity. During the holiday season I most likely will switch over to the oneplus 6t hopefully by the time they will fix some minor things.
Veselka	nice smartphone but that price
Kieran Garner	Why are people so butt hurt over 3.5 mm? I haven‚Äôt used wired headphones in ages!

FLUENCE	My OnePlus 6 became oneplus6T after the 9.0.2 update for OnePlus 6 lol and the reliable fast fingerprint sensor. 6t it's slow. I'll wait until it gets better. Until then am good to go and not even care about the 6t. Except the battery. Anyways I probably gonna take 7t or 8.  Because of thier 3 year software updates policy.!! ü§ó
MrXtravagantx	Ok so are there Bluetooth earphones or no? Is it wired earphones that you have to use the dongle for? Also on the OnePlus website do you have to buy the dongle and earphones separate? They make it seem like if you buy the phone, all you get is the phone, and the charger and accessories are all sold separately.
Peter de Vries	Does the s8 have  gorilla glass? Because then I can savely say its shit
Elliot Mackness	Linus! You must look at the Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 - It all sounds good until you see the camera over-sharpens images, ruining the high-quality 24MP. Please cover this to pressure Samsung to fix the issue!

brian williams	Total iPhone fanboy here, but this phone actually looks damn nice
gameflux	Cool !
urich lau	didn't someone dissed the iPhone notch and not having the audio jack like hell? or is it just androids copying iPhone so...
ctrl ult delete	linus said that he prefers the in glass fingerprint scanner over the back fingerprint scanner. and in jerry rig everything's video it shows that there actually isn't enough space because of the fingerprint scanner. the in-glass fingerprint scanner actually sets them apart from other phones than having a headphone jack as there are still phones with them (like the pocophone) but rarely any phones with the fingerprint scanner
Harits S Pahlawan	Hey man, awesome review as always keep up the good work!!  I'm from Southeast Asia and here, the xiaomi mi mix 3 is sweeping the whole a sweeping the whole place could you make an in-depth review about the gadget we would really appreciate that man

Vyanktesh Kanungo	Merchandise is a little too expensive, Linus!
Daniel Harris	Samsung Note 9 has no notch and has a headphone jack, which is the reason why I bought it over the OnePlus 6T.
manjot singh	Condom type case? 4:16
Danny Perski	6:28 Why would you need to bid farewell to your collection of wired headphones? They include an adapter so you can still use wired headphones...

Rayes Alnasra	3:29 i thought it was sponsor time. oh it rhymes :)
Torrey Townsend	I don't care about the 6T where did you get the bed set I must order one lol
Seye oderinde	At least he confess that it's a sponsored video which means he will majorly talk about the good part of the phone which should not be taken serious. Others like mkbhd will not will keep recommending phone so as to get free review phone whereby there are better value for money phone out there

Isaiah Martin	Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but  thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews,  and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.  Zondervan‚Äôs Bible Dictionary:  Ham ‚Äì The youngest son of Noah, born  probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to  live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the dark races; not  the Negroes, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites. Song of Solomon 1:5-6 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of  Jerusalem, as black as the tents of Kedar, as black as the curtains of  Solomon. Job @  my skin was black upon me. Lamentations 4:8 my skin was blacker than  coal. Isaiah 47:1-2 we had dreadlocks. Acts 13:1 I was called a nigger.  Daniel 7:9 burnt bronze skin Revelations @-15 hair like wool skin like burnt bronze. Song Of Solomon @  My dreadlocks are black & bushy. Enoch was a pitch black Ethiopian.  Moses married a black Ethiopian and passed for a black Egyptian and  Pharaoh son. Baby Jesus, Mary, & Joseph fled to Egypt to hide. Jesus  walked the desert for 40 days. Israel is on the continent of Africa.  The real Jews were Egyptian sun-slaves and have always been black.  Acts 7:6 Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Know for certain that for four  hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their  own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. Deuteronomy @-68.  Daniel @  Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they  might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and  the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because  we have sinned against him. Isaiah @  But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in  holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none  delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  Jeremiah 17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine  heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies  in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine  anger, which shall burn for ever. Isaiah 1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. Lamentations 1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and  because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth  no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. Luke @  They shall fall by the edge of the sword and be taken captives into all  nations. Jerusalem will be trodden down by gentiles until the times of  the gentiles be fulfilled. Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but  thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews,  and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

≈†pajdy Animation	Is it just me or does Linus remind The Doctor (David Tennant / Doctor Who) anyone else?
Malhar	When you're such a prominent and influential tech personality that phone companies send you their phones without you asking, but they wouldn't listen to you to bring back the headphone jack. We really like the headphone jack guys!
meatly1108	Fucking hell, it‚Äôs been 2 years now since the headphone jack has been leaving us, stop being a baby about it
John Ward	It‚Äôs a winner, Apple should have offered an in screen finger print sensor
Daz555Daz	No headphone jack? Argh....I was going to get this phone. Now I'm out.
Michel van Briemen	As long as the bloody type-C port doesn't die within 2 years, lovely
mikecantreed	Looks like a downgrade.  Fingerprint sensor is less efficient, no headphone jack, no LED.  Weren't they pitching dash charge hard before?  Why would they sack all of these fundamental aspects of the device for a marginally better battery and a beta version of the in screen FP sensor?
eug3nius	Starts at 0:52
Konata Izumi	Good to see people are not wanting to buy this phone due to lack of headphone jack.  We shouldn‚Äôt giving money to Chinese company anyway.
Enigami NetShinobi	Imagine the camera behind the screen
Andre Guillen	My biggest problem with both the 6 and the 6T is the lack of expandable storage. I can easily take the lack of a fingerprint scanner, headphone jack and the lack of dual cameras on the front (on the 6T) but I just can't live with the idea of going without a Micro SD card slot for the long haul. I guess one could argue that it's kind of superfluous with the larger 256GB model but I for one am still rocking my Galaxy S5 with a 200GB Micro SD card and I've filled that old clunker to the brim. If it had a slot and I'd be getting, essentially, double the storage with the upgrade it'd be a no-brainer; but right now, I can't justify that loss. This is all kind of moot anyway since 5G is just around the corner anyhow and it would behoove all of us to wait it out, from anywhere from a few more months to a year, for new phones to be released that are compatible with the new generation.
DRWXP	One minus the headphone jack.
Ahmed Al-Bayati	Audio seems off
Lee Hall	So... Sponsor biased review aside. Would you actually buy full price and use this phone as your daily driver, and would you recommend it?
Edward Bedor	I use bluetooth headphones so I am willing to live without the headphone jack.

Chris B√∂hnke	Reported for nudity. Almost saw a nipple.. Whyyyyyyyyy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Donte Bailey	The reason I stopped buying OnePlus is when I realized my 5T's type-C was using usb 2.0. It's the same for the 6 & 6T. A drawback for using their proprietary fast charging. I could never take advantage of my 128gb of storage because the transfer speeds were ridiculously slow. With the slow speeds left so much room for error when transferring files. So many of my files would stop transferring in the middle of the transaction. It's 2018!! Myself and entire OnePlus community has been asking them to stop making usb 2.0 type-c's for a while now. Deal breaker. I'll stick to my S9+ using usb 3.1 (gen1) and 512gb microSD.

Fidel Laurence Ricafranca	so no one's srsly gonna mention that "60" pun right at the intro?
Bill Karoly	I was ready to go to my local TMobile store and trade in my V30 before I looked up the specs. It's pretty impressive but for one omission. It's USB 2. If it had USB 3.1 I would have gone for it. For me that was the deal breaker.
JUNCTION MEDIA	Your earrings looks stupid.
Sunil N	Transparent condom type case, :D.
King Juli en	I won't retire my Sony MDR-7506 just because they are getting rid of the headphone jack. I'd rather retire their brand. Contrary to others I speak with my wallet, not the trend. I speak for myself.Dongle is not an option when number one Samsung with that bigger battery still has it.Don't blame the space, blame the design.

Damond Lam	The in-screen finger print sensor is not the first in 6T, and its responsiveness seems not great compared to that of Mate20 Pro from Huawei. It does not make sense. It looks like One Plus is boxed between Xiaomi and Huawei, and is not getting anywhere very soon.

MarsuveezBlack	Seriously, it makes no fucking sense. You add a god damn notch and then you get rid of the jack? Claiming it's to provide room for a bigger battery when we all KNOW that's bullshit because Samsung has a 4000 mAh battery, jack, expandable storage, AND a pen slot! You really think people who want a budget phone are gonna want to spend extra on Bluetooth headphones that have a lesser sound quality?

FredOrange3	no headphone jack? no buy...
Derek Burkett	People....it comes with the 3.5mm dongle in the box. All you lose is the ability to charge by cable and listen via wired headphones at the same time. I feel like the larger battery, and under-screen fingerprint sensor is well worth, since you aren't losing any screen real estate for hardware buttons.

DragoYT	4:13 CONDOM TYPE CASE??
YasH	It's coming to the end of 2018 and yet people are still complaining about the absence of the headphone jack. Lazy to carry the convenient (FREE) dongle they provided ? Plug it at your 3.5mm headphones and never have to worry about them again. Can't charge while using headphones ? Let me ask you, how often do you actually do that ? and on top of Dash charge, you'll get the phone to charge up to a sufficient battery percentage to use headphones right after you charge it. Still can't sacrifice the headphone jack for a bigger battery and a futuristic in-display fingerprint scanner ? Then you should just settle less for the OnePlus 6, end of story :)
Yahya Naveed	Long term? Like how many manufacturers keep that in mind when making phones? Ain't sealed battery - a common thing - a bigger threat for long-term usage?
Timothy de Vries	can you use a normal usb-c cable or only the fast charging
Ganesh Thakore	Does 6gb ram is enough??
Albert M	Chuckled at the sad music intervention thing. Cheer up, Linus, wired headphone users don't have to get rid of them. It's just kinda unwieldy to have that converter, and you can't charge during use, it seems, but hey

BatMo	Those gestures i had on a zenfone 2 from 2015 so nothing new,just the fingerprint sensor and sponsored video by the same company.
IdealIdeas100	No headphone jack? Garbage.
OGIMAA WAB	Thank for the great reviews and entertainment...
Alcer Sanny	I don't know why is it that hard to keep the headphone jack but to trade it with smaller notch??? I prefer bigger notch than eliminating the jack. And just now I read a google article that an unknown (at least to me) phone company named Nubia had an all screen phone. Yes, it has an all screen phone with no notch but it has no front camera as well. Instead, the company added a hidden second screen on the back of the phone so that you can use the rear camera for selfies. IMO this quite genius, rather than stuffing the phone with motorized camera or develop an expensive solution to place camera under the screen.
Aimlevel	04:28 - I'm dead.
Rakibul Hasan	I'm gonna buy samsung s9. They still have the headphone jack
Eujean Yu	That's cute. Now review the Pocophone F1
von mike	No more Oneplus after 3t
Chetan Naik	5:29 - Watch Linus reposition his hand to reach the non-existent rear fingerprint sensor.
CiVil Comicz	For the sole reason of the dongle, I'm not buying it
Kool Cat	Will you be able to replace the battery without senting it to the factory ?
Patrick Yeh	love my 5t, was going to continue supporting them...time to look at other budget flagships without crappy android skins :/
Firepower	Someone place make Linus saying "Nice." a gif. Please let it happen.

Evanllelos SG	i want that phone
GAME BOY ADVANCE	Remember when the front camera had flash and was super important.üòÇ
Melainium Falican	Oppo phones had that launch gestures years ago
Sal Figueroa	One plus is the new nexus
Zach Demand	I'm not sure which is worse, the notch or the lack of a headphone jack.
Alexander Pena	The knotch make me look at the screen to get sucked in and before I'm close to go in I get hit on the forehead.
Anil Kumar	He is One of the Best  FAKE reviewer of all time. Because all reviewers(including he, never talk about China phone problems(software updates, bugs, quality and safety). And they try to promote them directly or indirectly without saying security is important to everyone or every phone. This one plus parent company includes OPPO, vivo, real me, innome. Even xiaomi, pocco. Budget king pocco f1 camera can't even compete with iPhone SE camera(stabilization). These reviewers should try in movie's, because these guys are super actors.
Gabriel Cambraia	OP >> all
Antek Borkowski	The 0:50 six-ty pun...
La Vaka	He starts literally in bed with the sponsor. Lol
Edwin George	Linus says yes. Austin says a 60% no. Who will win?

Junior Rivera	- I own a One plus 6.. Best on the market. 6T? No headphone jack. That's a DEAL BREAKER for me. Not a fan of Bluetooth headphones... ‚òπÔ∏è
Arek R.	Good, if you're single you'll need at least 128GB of storage ^^
V√§pe	OnePlus 6t will never be a match for 6. -no 3,5mm -no led notification -under screen (optical) technically is worse than ultrasonic ("traditional") one -old notch actually looks better (in my case and it really doesn't take anything from screen) -raised prices due to actual downgrading wtf, thanks to god (not god, satan maybe) the old ones still exist for a small time to be collected by the smart individuals
Steffan Davies	Headphone socket is a deal breaker for me. Looks nice though.
Soul_Eater94	What was the issue with their wireless headphones that you mentioned?
Nick Rff	Linus wants an xray cameraüòÇ
Prince David	Oh god i wish my Samsung had this. One thing i miss from my last iPhone was that front facing fingerprint reader.
Jorge Daniel	Great phone. The lack of headphone jack is annoying, but I have foreseen this moment and changed to wireless already. The LED notification will be missed too, but honestly it is pretty useless, and I find myself tapping the screen to check which notifications I actually have, since you get so many these days. The changing of fingerprint reader to the front is a huge plus, as I find that the back is the worst place to have it, but my 3T works so well I can't justify buying a new one yet. Maybe the 7T when it comes out
Aleksa Markovic	Do these companies not realise just how many customers they're losing by removing the headphone jack?
mumia76	I'm still waiting for the phone with infinite screen! Where the screen wraps around the edges and goes around the back all the way. :p That's where we're heading aren't we? These phones where they try to move the screen closer to the edges are just ridicilous. How do you even hold it without accidentally touching the screen? Not to mention the obvious fragility of the design. And ALLNOTCHES MUST DIE!
Adnan Islam	how white is he! i really thought something was off with my screen
MechanoRealist	Yes I can't believe it, I can't believe just how muuuuuch smartphones have developed in these last two years! Just Holy shit! I'm currently still on my HTC10 for my daily driver and the launch of the 6T arrives just when I discover that my battery is dying on my 10. And seriously, even if I ignore the bezels and the whole 'notch' debacle and the backside fingerprint sensor and the multi camera. The 6T version I choose has 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Compared to my 10 that is *double* the amount of RAM and 8 times the storage space. And the 6T is still 20% cheaper than my 10 was at the time of purchase!!
Sgt. Lagger LP	No Headphonejack ‚Ä¶ at least Stereospeakers .,. but the idiots dont ‚Ä¶ no buy ...
mrdub02	Hows the OS updates and build quality.  Never tried a OnePlus but was looking at an LG G7 One before seeing this...
Arcade Slum	LMFAO $550 for this garbage? No removable battery and in exchange for that not waterproof? GARBAGE.  Get an LG v20 h918 off ebay for >$100 and enjoy a real phone. Quad DAC ir blaster removable battery and no gimmicks.
Tinetariro Chikati	Did you borrow the glasses from Supersaf.
Geoff Johnson	The 6T looks amazing!  FYI, you can save $20 on the phone and any accessory by using this link: https://www.oneplus.com/invite#54G4TN7QFIJKPML
Sharishth Singh	Why enthusiast brands will betray you ? - TechAltar Yes he was right.
Chris Hanline	Wait. Wait wait wait. Episode 60 is about the 6T? Come on. That's providence.
kdawgmaster	Pfft my asus Rog Phone is in the mail. Cant wait :D
J.P. Lasalle	Yes!! Get a house coat.  I‚Äôd get it.
Jose The Rover	great review
m√ØrƒÖ√±dƒÅ ƒç√∏sgr≈çvƒó sweg	why is everyone against the notch? i simply don't get it, I think it's beautiful
Demar Thompson	Saw "sponsored by Oneplus". Ended video.
epevtolser	I have a one plus phone now and to be honest the notification light and a headphone jack are essential for me. I listen to a lot of music and sometimes I need to plug in the charger and headphones together. The 6T does not work for me unfortunately but I guess for most people it won't be an issue.
Aquib Haider	Mate 20 pro is much better.
Carlos Pr	you forgot to talk about its biggest weakness, the camera. Its not that good in the 6t tbh, though I guess compromises must be made for that price
Catherine Ado	I want his bathrobe tbh. Where did you get that?
Mudassar Shaikh	Please review mi mix 3
Skymur	time to upgrade from oneplus 2? not to the 6t. I refuse to support no headphone jack culture. I'll get myself a Zenfone 5 then.
fan1701	I'm not buying a phone that has no standard headphone jack. There is no excuse not to have one. Charge me extra but include a headphone jack!
Guy Lloyd	One Plus has blundered the OP6T and their Bullets Wireless earphones.
Richard Robertson	I was so sad with this phone. Died when they got rid of the headphone jack. I would definitely get this phone if it had a headphone jack and no fingerprint sensor
Robin Stevens	Great phone again!! This website shows the availability history of OnePlus phones and offers a free $20/‚Ç¨20/¬£20/‚Çπ1000 discount code for immediate use if you're thinking about ordering a brand new OnePlus6T from the official website: @t You're welcome!

Justus Springer	Why 19.5:9? Just call it 13:6 you idiots!
Sehr Geheim	Wtf, why should I watch a sponsored video when there are many honest videos coming out at the same time? I like OnePlus, even own one myself, but this is just cheeky
Corvo Kross	Man we are at 6T now?  Still rolling with my OG OnePlus in perfect shape.
SHASHANK G	Pocophone add in one plus videoüòÇüòÇ
OGi DOGi	Overpriced.
herrjonna2007	In bed with oneplus.. HA I get it!
Eden	Can we get a S7 with newer hardware? I don't like all of the new phones.
THEGHOSTSLAVE	I loved my OnePlus models. I've had a OnePlus 2, a OnePlus 3, and I've messed a OnePlus 5. Yes, they're flagship killers. But when it came to getting my first brand new phone this past week (every OnePlus I had was used) I ended up getting a Galaxy Note9. And the reason is interesting. I couldn't  afford a OnePlus 6t..in cash.   I can finance a Note9, S9+, LG V40, whathaveyou through a carrier or reputable retailer (BestBuy), interest free, for ~$30/month. Nobody finances OnePlus in the States that I could find, and I couldn't  justify dropping the $600 cash to get a new OnePlus.

madius the madlad	NICE BONUS !
Armin Tabatabai	If phones constantly want to drop the 3.5mm jack because their phones are getting thinner, why don't they just adopt the 2.5mm jack, which already exists?   Most audiophile hardware uses the 2.5mm jack anyway, and it is a better standard in my opinion.   Phones need an analogue output. We can only hear sound in analogue form, so if your phone only has Type-C, you basically have no DAC apart from the one permanently connected to the internal speakers. The 3.5mm jack is essentially your output DAC, so whenever you buy a pair of Bluetooth earphones or Type-C earphones, you're paying for a lesser quality, miniturised DAC built in on the headphone end to compute the digital signal from the Type-C port, and you're buying it over and over and over because it's built into the heaphone, making it more expensive and unnecessary, and if it's a Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, it will probably have a lesser quality one than a discrete one built into the phone since it will be bottle-necked through the port.   I don't understand why companies are doing it. If people like Apple (the morons who pushed this whole craze) even truly believed in this idea of a jack-less future (assuming they consider it a legacy system that needs replacement) why do their newest laptops which came out after the iPhone 7 still have the jack?
Dmpablaze	people need to get over the "almighty" headphone jack. cords suck people, they have always sucked! theres wireless headphones now... get with the times, wireless is the future... deal wit it!

Ma Co	LINUS U SEXY DAMN
Luka Pavlesic	They are selling Mirror Black and Midnight Black versions while you are mentioning Matte black glass? which one is that?
vitality of spirituality	The people who bitch about the headphone jack are the same people that don‚Äôt use it half the time üòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs a propriety connector and requires to change digital to analog within the phone, and honestly I don‚Äôt listen to music enough to need it

Johnny knows	The same phone as the last one. The only difference is notch and fingerprint scanner. Save your money and buy the old one. It's 399 dollars currently.
Bon Esson	Im more upset by the removal of the notificationlight than the headphonejack. I use the headphonejack maybe once a week, but the not.light is used a lot everyday.
Antichrys	Honest question that requires honest answers:  How often do you guys REALLY use that headphone jack?

Karthik Hegde	Poco f1 ads on oneplus 6t videos. lol
MrSketchys	I've enjoyed watching this channel for its geeky reviews of products. But this is the first review that strikes me in tone and content as totally compromised. You're notoriously hard to please; and pick up tons of small / slight flaw a product has. That's why I tune in, even though I often totally disagree and tend to think you're making mountains our of mole hills ... I like to know what someone with a keen eye thinks. Yet for the latest OnePlus phone you could only find the lack of a headphone jack irksome? GTFO. This company was caught last Fall stealing user data and transmitting to servers in China via that custom Android variant you praised in this review... and AGAIN this January! To fail to mention their tainted reputation is a shot to your credibility and proof you cannot fairly review products while accepting a sponsorship from them too.
Michael Christensen	Since the new fingerprint sensor is optical - does the screen have to be on for it to scan your finger?  I am wondering this, since the capacitive sensors I've used so far, all work without turning on the screen - which means that unlocking is a singular action.   It seems to me, that for the 6T the screen would have to be turned on first (making unlocking 2 actions) or use always on.  Anyone who can shed some light on this?
Suyash Kathar	giving out phone without lauch is dumb people not smart
Alvin Kwardi	Dongle!? Bye OnePlus, u're supposed to be the solution of all these mainstream craps.

Sean Herrera	This guy had no idea what he‚Äôs talking about on usbc cable and fast charging smfh. Like what‚Äôs so wrong that‚Äôs their inside the box??? Because iPhone don‚Äôt do that at all!! They want you to buy that separate like appreciate that their including that with the phone unlike iPhone
garthvater111	I would have taken a rear finger print reader and headphone jack over this any day. It is really disappointing, i mean sure the phone on desk problem exists, but you could just put it on a phone stand and leave it unlocked, or reach around. And when your not at your desk, and your phone is in your pocket, the rear sensor is always going to be faster. I mean i have the original pixel xl, and its always unlocked before its even fully out of my pocket, at the very worst as im pulling it up to my face. Its second nature and naturally offer a betting grip on the phone, as you can do this with the screen side sensor, but your thumb is on the middle of the phone, not the side.  Not to mention there would still be a headphone jack. Seriously, unless we at some point have a movement for all headphones and audio outputs move type c, this implementation will never be better. And you still cant charge while listening to music, unless your headphones also need to be charged...  I was really hoping this phone would check of every box for me. But unfortunately it doesnt. I still hate that its got a notch, even if its easily the best implement out of the bunch, no headphone jack, and not rear fingerprint reader. I really want a new phone, but the only one on the market that checks of every box for me is the note 9, except for the one labeled "is it a Samsung," which has cemented itself in the do not purchase section for their lack of suport and longevity.
opendebate	Linus makes way more sponsored contents than the actual reviews.
Stephen Frame	Just another device that demonstrates how expensive the new i-phone is in comparison.
Salman Awan	This is more of a downgrade
b888	While the west has the cheapest desktop and laptop market, the east by far has the smartphone market. Your smartphone prices & specs & single locked SIM is hilarious.  Just like how the x86-64 was developed in Murcia while it was rapidly growing in the last century smartphones in India and China are being developed while we are rapidly growing. Hence these products here are very competitively priced just like computers (the tech that started while the US was still developing nation) are priced in the west.  Once the country becomes developed, prices skyrocket for nothing. Things become stagnant. Value for the consumers money is lost. Companies become greedy and we have first world problems!

Mus	I bought an LG V30 for the headphone jack and don't even use it that much. The oneplus 6T is my next one. Done paying nearly a grand for a phone.
Alex McDowell	The LG Stylo 4 is better in its only $99
Rigo R.M	With wireless charging getting ramped up it makes wireless headphones a lot more of a sure thing for the future. Us consumers are just going to have to adjust. There are definitely upsides to wired connection but companies are all in competition to create great wireless earphones and headsets so in a years time this really won't be an issue. I don't share the sentiment that removing the headphone jack was a bad move. It's just and adjustment we're all going to have to make when using phone.
Stamps Gaming	I will keep my Op 6
Akash Bhatnagar	this guy must have made countless no. of videos praising the positioning of fingerprint sensors at the back in Samsung and other Chinese devices,.And now, all of a sudden, since one plus sponsors him, he likes them at front.
shaggy433	Quite surprised that no one is mentioning the lack of wireless charging! That and the missing headphone jack means I wont buy it! I think I could live with being a part of the "Dongle Nation" but I love my wireless charging mouse-pad too much!!

Cosmin Gurau	Disgustingly biased, sponsored review. Linus NEVER even mentioned the POCOPHONE F1 in any video, which is by far the craziest thing on the smartphone market in 2018.
Darrell Ng	what's up with companies not knowing how to count these days?Apple, Microsoft..now Oneplus..first they skipped 4..now they jumped way up to Sixty real quick
AlphaHunter	Everyone ripping on OnePlus for lack of a 3.5mm jack. The company has improved upon so many of the features -- the notch, fingerprint scanner, display and screen real estate, and definitely the price -- that its competitors didn't. I use wired earbuds probably 12 hours a day when i'm not sleeping, at work, or in class; but credit should be given where credit is deserved.
Sachin Bhandari	Hi. I have a question. I like to play mobo games. Since the sensor is on screen. I will have to continuously press it while playing games like Pubg or other action games. Will it affect my fingerprint sensors?
switzer ville	I'm sorry but that intro really freaked me out
Ashley Edwards	I'm surprised about loosing the jack but come to think about it, i can't remember the last time i used my jack. I have bluetooth in my car, bluetooth portable speakers, bluetooth earphones...
Uptown NYC	Who the fuck still uses wired earbud headphones in 2018? Earbuds promote early hearing loss compared to regular headphones. Google it you stupid pricks. Just use bluetooth with Bose or whatever headphones and be done with it. Quit cryin like bitches cause they took away your headphone jack AGAIN waaaaaaaaaah!üò©üò©
Phobicc_	While many people are so unreasonably angry over the removal of the headphone jack I have to admit I'm not. Some of the cheapest, decent quality earbuds on the market today cost $15-$20 USD and OnePlus is releasing wired USB-C for $20 with the new Bullet Earbuds. The only reason I have been against the conversion to a single port phone standard is the unavailability of cheap USB-C earbuds, as the best ones I could find were the EarbudsHD from Essential, but they are way overpriced. Now that these cheap ones are in the market, well, I have to say I'm open to the 3.5mm's removal if companies so please.
Ian Moera	and here i am using cheap-ass $100 phone with headphone jack and LED notification light...
M S	Not regretting that I bought the OP6 last month, as the headphone jack is quite important to me.  The onscreen fingerprint sensor is awesome and several other features of the 6T are also, but it is that important to me personally that I can use the 3.5mm on my smartphone. Almost a great job OnePlus. Almost.
asorlon1	this phone is still better then apple and samsung IMO
Alumni deChaos	Isn't there an adaptor for using wired headphones?
Squeaker/w/mic	Is this a good starting android phone to get the hell out of apple?
differlot	I have sweaty hands, so i imagine the fingerprint scanner may be problematic
Norwell Miranda	Upon reading the comments, headphone jack is really a deal breaker.
realhjt	notch + no headphone jack = trash
William Waffle	Couldn't they at least include two USB ports?
HammersmashedFace	Good that my old Phone runs and runs. These Notch Phones are so ugly. I dont want anything in my Screen. No Curve, No Notch..the blank Screen with all of his constant pixels per inch. Btw i've new wqhd monitor, thanks for the good video source! :D
Mark Sheldon	Sad
DarkWolf S	I'm not just disappointed, but I'm also NOT going to buy the 6t due to the missing headphone jack.  Especially sad because I was waiting for the 6t to upgrade from my 3t, not anymore...
SirBilliam	Honestly, I was about to give up my iPhone 6s Plus for this phone until you mentioned it had no headphone jack. The only reason I still have my 6s Plus when I used to upgrade almost every year is because of the jack. Almost every day, I charge my phone and use the jack simultaneously when I'm in my car, since mine doesn't have BT (and no, those BT to 3.5mm adapters are not okay, they all sound like shit). I was unhappy with the S9+ I purchased earlier this year, so this phone looked really intriguing. Sadly, that feature just killed it for me.
dashaun Stewart	Why why are they taking away the headphone jack. I mean at least add two type c ports or something.
ExploringFate	I'm glad there was no wardrobe malfunction where Linus dropped his robe.
Ti6ko	Bullshit. My op5 dropped once from 50cm and the screen exploded.
Spooky shiz	I'm amazed Its finally on my carrier I was actually saving up for a pixel screw that phone I'm getting this
GilgameshEthics	A review sponsored by the company that makes it. :/
Hopelessly Broken	Everybody complains about phones without headphone jacks, but is it seriously that big of a deal? Even if you don't have any wireless headphones you can buy them for about twenty dollars. Only true audiophiles who shelled out one and a half thousand dollars for some expensive Sennheiser headphones or something would need to be concerned with the removal of the connector, and you can still just buy an adapter to fix that issue. All that will be affected there is your ability to charge and listen to music at the same time, and hey, the iPod Shuffle had the same issue ten years ago.
David Saji	I understand why people are mad about the headphone jack being removed but this is just a part of the struggle of going to a fully universal port such as USB-C. Apple removed the headphone jack not because they didn't have space but because  one port for everything is the future such as USB-C, this is the reason why all brands are removing the headphone jack, it is a struggle whilst we move to a universal port but imagine when everything from you headphones to your charger can use the same port. There will be a point when we only need USB-C for all devices which would be amazing.
John Clingmon	I was about to watch til I saw it was a sponsored video by the company themselves. No thanks, bugs me when people try to promote a companies product that was sponsored. Seriously wtf Linus, youre rich af buy your own damn ticket and be a tech YouTuber one time
chernowi	Sorry andy rubin, no one remember what kind of notch had the essential phone...
Savin Wangtal	what is the best Android phone under 5‚Äù screen right now?
Burt Co	Do mi mix 3 please
ChitownCraig	Thank you for confirming that the notification light is gone. That was a great feature all around. I would rather have that back than the audio jack.
TheQuentinSK8	My 3T is still going strong and I see no real reason to upgrade it once my contract runs out
Christian Zarghetta	Too bad I‚Äôm locked in IOS......
AJKHD	Condom type case!!
gmonkman	soz dont care. loved the dell uberizing though .. note the spellinzzzzg compromise.
Gavin Miller	Why did she say unless you're willing to Bid Farewell to your wired headphones when they give you a dongle it's the same exact thing people
Asdaq Rafeeque	3:22 This is Linos He'll be able to drop something that hovers in the air.
MangoTek	As someone who doesn't care about the headphone jack because I carry around a dedicated DAC/amp that takes USB output anyhow(Oppo HA-2SE), I still wouldn't buy it because I can't replace the battery or expand the storage.  That's an absolute dealbreaker for me forever, and no amount of bling can replace that.
Juan D' Angelo	07:00 nice midnight cowboy reference there!
shoham00	No headphone jack == no buy.  I like OnePlus, I've bought a few for myself and family, but they should be punished by the market for this design mistake.
Mohamad Wahba	seriously one of the very few fun to watch reviews with a brand new unboxing style, excellent @Linus
Mathias Kalhauge	*SPONSORED BY ONEPLUS*  Welp... Guess I'll have to wait for MKBHD
Marco Troxler	ugly notch, ugly chin, shitty cameras, shitty mono speaker, no wireless charging, no ip68 nor 67, no headphone jack, faceid that dont work in darkness and touchid dont work with wet fingers. APPLE SUCKS
Tom F	No sd card, so nope.
chugs Rodr√≠guez	Advert
John Constantine	does it have infrared?
Michael Driskell	6:29 bid farewell to wired headphones? I use one pair mostly and using an adapter is incredibly easy... I dont care that the headphone jack is gone because it was done for a good reason. Beautiful screen and has a fingerprint scanner built in. Worth a headphone adapter.
fuk0ff PACY	Im dumb, is there still memory-card slot?
TechUser	Oh my god what is going on with the headphone jack cringe in the comments. You want a headphone jack? Cool go buy a different phone and stop bitching
Stedman75	as a person who had never had a smart phone before ever.. I got a OnePlus 5T and i love it..
Rob	This intro is very erotic.
James Imonitie Oriaghan	You meant to say "I'm walking over here!!"
GLTSA	My OnePlus 5t still rocks ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lowen264	After having a Moto Z Force for almost 2 years now I have to say no 3.5mm jack is a deal breaker for me.  Bluetooth is terrible for this phone.  It crackles and spits when the screen turns off and on.  Having to use a dongle is just straight up embarrassing.  Especially since(from what I've experienced) no reputable company makes them.  Sorry for that rant.
i7rs	No headphone jack?! Case closed!
VladimirPudding	meh still gonna stick with my samsung galaxy s6 tbh
Amu Cheeki	Honestly , test drops should be done by  7 year olds, if it can survive that than its worth every penny.
DAVE B	https://youtu.be/6RGq6WM5WBg answers the scratched FUD question
MoDzAudio Electronics	Good price for a beautiful phone. Who needs a headphone nowadays when everything is bluetooth.
Felodur	rip oneplus
archampion	I don't understand why OnePlus don't add in the waterproof/water resistant and wireless charging.
Vladimir Enchev	what about the mi mix 3?
CoolCrange x	Can I get a RIP in the chat? (For the headphone jack)
Y2Kvids	Condom like transparent case? Really?
MrGatlin98	I'm a simple man. No headphone jack? No buy.
DoctorX17	Under-screen fingerprint sensor is probably the coolest thing... I'd like one on the back too though, honestly. That dewdrop notch is much less of a turn-off than others, but meh. Hopefully we'll see under-screen cameras before my Pixel 2 XL dies
SprockerDog	In terms of the headphone jack removal - I think overall it's an incredibly personal things as everyone has different tastes. I originally laughed at the idea of the removal but as soon as I    swapped to a new phone without it, I hardly noticed that it was gone. The main argument against the removal, as far as I can see is the drop  in    audio quality when moving towards Bluetooth headphones. I feel that Bluetooth is at a point where it can provide ample audio to support or      even  impress anyone who isn't an audio engineer. Also, the people who aren't audio engineers are also likely now using a streaming service to  get there music, or getting it from online. The music there, is for the most part, compressed so you probably wouldn't even notice. There are some places that do allow you to stream .WAV although items uploaded in this are incredibly rare in comparison to the rest of the music    available on those sites, so unless you want to listen to Kanye West's 'Ye'  the music quality won't differ too much(Although, again, if you're an    audio       engineer and that concerned about the audio quality you probably won't be listening to his album or a streaming service) . I also read   that   you  complained about the wireless headphones not fitting under various helmets or hats, whereas your wire buds would, and quite frankly that's purely down to your choice in wireless earbud as there are some that are smaller than wired bud without compromising the audio. The      removal of the headphone jack will also push the industry into further developing Bluetooth and bringing more substantial updates, such as that of improved audio quality, and it does make the phones easier to waterproof, or make resistant to water (You know, one less hole). While there    are many arguments for removing the headphones jack I do feel that it was undeniably a move for profit maximisation from larger companies.    Also I saw someone else mention the note 9 (Which I now own, having moved from a phone that lacked a headphone jack, for other reasons)    s having all of the amazing specs and still having a headphone jack, you need to think about the actual size of the device, because it certainly isn't small and if you wanted to make a phone smaller you would probably have to kill the headphone jack or hold back in the tech you put into the    actual device.
-EM-	Long term?
Tom Brownlee	How are the haptics though? How does it feel to use in your hand? To type on? Is there a nice bump on the home button?
Ripirius Scribble	This just a sponsored unboxing folks, not the *real* review. I repeat, *just unboxing* so we just seeing, no touching no reviewing.
Simon	Don't mix Sponsorship & Reviews Linus, thumbs down
Noir Kamui	Oh dady... I mean... srsly, it may sound weird... but this a bit brave video concept, including the "I'm disappointed" made this channel survive my youtube channel purge :D Dave2D didn't, he's boring and talks only about expensive stupid details.
Max Power	Trading in my V20 and getting this for $300. A steal IMO
Johny Appleseed	Condom like case.  That just went by and I couldn‚Äôt tell he said it for a bit
mjc0961	Why do we have to choose between front and back fingerprint scanners? Put one on each side, since both locations have their pros and cons. When pulling it out of my pocket, I can use the back. When on a table, I can use the front. Win win. I'd rather see than then all this other gimmicky crap, like no\small bezels and under display cameras.
Niclas Kron	whats up with ur eyes linus
James Howlett	Whenever this guy talks, he never sounds legit, he always sounds like he's advertising something, like all his advertisements that he sneaks into his channel. I can never believe this guys reviews.
zephyr Chan	oh Ôºåtoo many foreigners like headphone jack, you can get it's dad oppo r17 . but I forgot you can't  buy it,  you don't live in China.
Awen478	oneplus gone full retard on this phone rip
Tw√≥j Mistrz	Wanted to change my  oneplus 5 to this one but no jack eliminates it. Fk bluetooth sound quality.
Ajit Jalady	I just got a one plus 6 256GB today with a headphone jack
jakedude182	lovely phone, but upgraded to 3700Mah battery, jesus these batteries are what lets the entire phone down, why don't they charge more for say a 5000Mah battery alongside the normal model. If out for a day you don't have to lug around a seperate battery thats the size of the phone almost in the process
tokio genji	Bought OnePlus 6 last month, not having the headphone jack was a deal breaker tbh, I have got noise cancelling Bose ¬£250 earphones...yeah nah. and oneplus6 is really amazing, 8GB with 128 Storage is more than enough.
Wizartar	Wired headphones for life!! WH4L
Slaughter Gang Shit	2:54 Samsung?
Subodh Ranjan	@JonathanMorrison.  Could you compare this to the iPhone XR. OnePlus even made the things that much fairer by removing the headphone jack. :|  PS:  Let me ensure that this isn't another "hate" message. Also, not an Android fanboy. I have used both iPhone and Android. Im just a normal consumer of phone in sub-750$ price range who would hope that the YouTube channels, that I so much believe, would give a fair comparison.   Peace ! (Y)
Ostrich160	Looks like a nice phone, of course without the jack there is no chance in hell I'll ever buy it.
MastaX	The price will be $549 for the lowest end model. I wonder if they do financing?
Kenny Pierre	Yeah think its time to finally retire my one plus one
Robert Breeden	Headphone jack is a deal breaker.
Septien Patterson	OnePlus 6t unboxing in üõè peak unboxing

Chin Chin	STOP MAKING FLAGSHIP PHONES BIGGER
Paul Colella	Review sponsored by the manufacturer? What? And seriously, nobody wants to listen to you in your bathrobe. Gross.
Oliver Kromann	i currently own a lovemei extreme protection case which has a flap/opening for my jackport however most jack based headphones are too thick at the base of where the 3.5mm is placed so i had to go bluetooth which after my ink'd wireless have died on my right ear leaving me "music-less" when on the train:/  i am about to file my return order due to my 2 year warranty but will need to find my approval of purchase first(the note you get when buying stuff)
Jordan Warrington	I was so hyped and was going to buy the phone or at least get it on contract but i want my headphones wired.
Arpan toppo	Good morning
Jonathan Haro	good job, OnePlus. idgaf about the headphone jack. crybabies don‚Äôt @ me
N L	I think people only hit dislike to keep him honest
Austin Herberger	Does anyone know the name of the song used during the bulk of the review?
Soulless leftover!	I don‚Äôt want to know what Linus did to that box, before opening it.
bbsnipo	So, why don't phones come with two usb-c ports?
Ali Harman ANSARI	I though I saw thanos's car and click..but it is a phone review.
AnyHow Tech	4:14 Condom type case üôÑ
anirudh kakkar	I too like fingerprint scanner on front so that I can use it while the phone is resting on the surface üëçüëçüëç
geraintwd	Wow. Sponsored by OnePlus. So basically a 7 minute ad. Great job.
nik kamil	Only things why i bought oneplus 6 are headphone jack and dash charging.. now, mate20 pro and note 9 seems a better choice for me.. gonna switch from oneplus later.. bye op6
LUTFI Rahman	Is it just me or is anybody out there also do not care as much for the headphone jack....I feel like ppl hating are only jumping on the bandwagon of hating it.
Flynk	Transparent Condom type case.
Leo Modzz	Love 1+
Bishal Poddar	Really oneplus, u removed the headphone jack. I really don't understand why oh why company follows that stupid company apple. Now it seams oneplus is also not caring about the customer anymore. Shame on u. I will no longer buy oneplus. Good Bye.
Akantormassaker91	I would have been pretty excited to upgrade from my OP3, but that missing headphone jack is a dealbreaker....
Jack Wolf	I buy phone base on four features, 1st; OLED, second; "contact interface" here how it works, after talked to John he said my wife wanted to you , so I scroll down on his contact his wife is in the relationship as spouse, touch Mary's name and it takes me to contact info. 3rd; "contact short cut to home page" 4th; " photo face tag " by  touching the picture it will allow to call, text and email from the picture. this is an AMAZING features from S4, S5 and Note 4 but Samsung removed it from S6 and later models. my current daily driver is Galaxy S9+ which has everything except photo face tag if one plus has all 4 my features and I will pay $1,000 for it. Linus find me a phone with all 4 features and I will donate a great $$ for your Chanel :)
FUNN SIDE	In display fingerprint... it "sucks"üò´üò´
1UpsForLife	So I guess this isn't technically a review, because it's sponsored by OnePlus? It really looks like a review...
Bradford Rus	The intro was totally a dig on Red's phone and their lack of a review sample
Blaugrana	idk why everyone is adding onscreen fingerprint sensonrs. i preferred the sensor on the back because its easier to unlock from a pocket
Russell Love	No headphone jack. No.  No thank you.
Mopar Mar	linus Tech Tips can you review the xiaomi mi mix 3 the official bezel less phone
Apratim Debnath	oneplus 6t is really a good phone. youtubers always say that and compare it with iphone. i wonder if any youtuber really bought oneplus for everyday use not for only review. here linus wore apple watch so i am assuming he is using iphone right now.
gur_ re	the internet at my house is great but my room (and my computer) is at the  other side of my house do you have a solution for me?
Mensch Meier	You can see. If even a chinese company which beats the employees, fucks on nature and dont pay taxes want to build a phone, which wants to come in the near of an iPhone, its almost expensive as an iPhone. But without the very good ecosystem of Apple. So you have to buy the other shit additional, which made this android at the end more expensive like a Xs. And you have to sell your soul to the devil... √§hhh... Google. Sorry.
cwk18	"transparent condom type case" Linus 2018
AM 2:42	Ima get it
Kung Fury	i wanntttt
ClayDog	Fingerprint sensor!!  Wow that is so cool and 10 years old.
Skyliner	I stopped  watching after i noticed apple notch. I will NEVER buy a phone with a stupid notch. Fuck everyone that makes phones like that because apple did it. Double fuck them for removing 3.5mm jack,  and they are expensive, just, fuck them. Plenty of phones out  there that didn't submit to the bad trends,  buy those instead.
NwJonathans	The Jack will soonly be gone. Move on and buy double dongles. It's worth the money.
Rahul Dhakne	i dont like the video when i see sponsored
darknessviking	this is a random comment
Shaikh Arslaan	üòÜ ü§£ü§£ 4:15 what a case!!
leo sky	I used to be one of those "fuck phones with no 3.5 jack". And I still am, I hate the practice. But I also just realized that I havent used anything but blueetooth earbuds when going out, in like 3 years. They're just so convenient...
Joris Vromans	Oneplus says that wireless charging was left out because it wasn't fast enough yet. I think they missed the point of wireless charging there...ü§î
MORTUSS	Mobile reviews make me bored after 3 minutes! Yawnnn...
Lord Tech Pro	Something that many do not know: OnePlus, Vivo and Oppo are the SAME COMPANY!
Neil Deshpande	OnePlus' website after watching this video: Condom like transperent case  free in box
Makayla Serniotti	I think I'll stick to my galaxy note 9...
Matt Merrill	No phone company out there is making what people actually want. NO one would care if companies didn't make a phone this year and instead design phones that didn't have a notch. But they just want money, not what consumers want. I'll buy a $1000 phone if it had all this in it: OLED 2K Display  15 MP With 6 Axis OIS  Snapdragon 840 Processer 8 GB Ram DDR4 4000 maH Battery 128 GB storage IR Blaster Dual Speakers AR Compatibility Removable Battery Bluetooth 5.0 (current phones only have 4.0) Quick Charge Headphone Jack USB Type C Waterproof NO NOTCH Fingerprint scanner on both sides Gorilla glass 5 Works with Google Project Fi Latest Android thats out
Christian	Audio sound weird to anyone else? Sounds really low quality, even when I'm playing at high resolutions.
Michael Fydenkevez	Would have bought this over the galaxy s9 but no headphone jack, wireless charging, there's a notch, worse camera, and a 1080p screen
Mr Reaper	JUST BUY A FUCKING GALAXY!
CŒ©Œ†SPIRŒîCŒ® THŒ£Œ©RIST	I know a very few guys who listen to music while charging.So omitting the headphone jack for the sake a 12% bigger battery seems quite a good bargain.

naga sravan	Wow they paid you as well? Damn OnePlus getting rich
Alexander Verdoodt	Hey Linus, it's super weird seeing you in a robe the whole video through but not as weird as OnePlus sponsoring this video. Was this a review? How does that work?

Jason Yu	The lacking of headphone jack is a lot to not like

White Leo Gaming	Now try xioami mi mix 3

Abu-Ahmad	Oneplus is killing the game. I like it
TheBournPL	Buying it week after it'll launch :D
Pouranan Katapermal	Why did u show these gestures? Mtk devices had it for years. At least 2014. You could've showed newer ones
Aljaxus	OnePlus FTW :D Not saying I'm buying one (because money), but it looks damn COOL :P
Gustavo Taliano	who Buys this "budget" Phone when you can actually buy for example an S8+  for Less money?
Premium Aphid	To be honest, I kinda like the glasses on Linus
Phantumix	Me want
Amogh	I got a Oneplus 6t ad on this video.
JKSSubstandard	At this point, the first phone to provide a second USB C connection, allowing you to charge the phone while listening to music...you know, like a normal human being does pretty regularly, will be phone Jesus.
Virat Kamble	What? Condom type case?
ZpG Killua	does it have microsd expansion?

Naughty Nookie	*no headphone jack, dumb oxygen os!*
lovely time	can we get rid of the selfie camera and just be done with this bullshit?
Master681	The notch looks terrible. I'd much rather have a little bezel on top over that. All in the name of copying Apple, Apple, and Apple.
P P HUNTER	i just bought the 6 few months ago lol
muhammad halim	We just need someone to make a good case connecting a headphone jack and charging port in two separate parts.
PETRAKOV1	Without fingerprint back on the phone and  3.5mm jack  no way to spend money for it.
Totenmon CS:GO	hm on the thumpnail you look a bit like James Veitch
julius de los reyes	The 1+ dongle looks prettier than iPhone dongles
Chang Yang	Ugly notch and no headphone, I'll pass
Lloyd Carter	Cue pages of "Waaa my headphone jack" comments. So nauseating.
[LVES] R1veR	Plz make a video about the huawei mate 20 pro. The phone have a lot of coll features you can show off.  I would really like to see a video about it on your channel
*defense*	OP6 > OP6T
Anuj Kapoor	A BIG dislike. Linus we need to let these companies know that we DO NOT want the 3.5mm Jack to go away. This idiotic nonsense needs to STOP. Bloody F!@#ing Apple started this and now these people want to get on saving every penny. NO it should STOP and we people count on you to voice it out to them. This video of yours sends a message that we are going to be in term with this. NO. YOU HAVE TO VOICE THIS OUT. PLEASE!
TrisskyTV	Gonna hold on OnePlus 6 (non-T)
Skrillz Playz	Did he seriously say "Condom type case"?!!?!
Ian Chorne	Not having a headphone jack sucks but the one on my iPhone 5s has been broken for the past year and a half so I'm already used to life without it
Lance Lindle Lee	Screen under the display, you mean the Mi Mix 3?
SubzeroDev	I much prefer the fingerprint sensor on the back (5T), because the front can be unlock by face-unlock already. When it's on the table, I simply double tab and let it scan my face, it jumps to home screen instantly.
Ethan	I mt heart died when I saw that 3.3 to usb adapter
Lukas Tran	notchn't
THE16THPHANTOM	i'm sure there are people who just stopped buying phones with no headphone jack. just functional oriented people. the notch, i'm pretty much avoiding it, doesn't matter how old the phone is as long as it doesn't have a notch. just waiting out for death of this trend.
wv9mm	I looks like I'm just going to have to get the Note 9 with the 3.5 headphone jack. After a while of using the Iphone 7, I noticed the difference between "No headphone jack" vs "Headphone jack".
TheMk002	I wonder if this guy is still a virgin?
Esfak EA	I‚Äôm still disappointed about no stereo speakers üò≠
James Rowe	You can tell how much time he's actually spent with the device with the fact that he doesn't know that "turning off the notch" still keeps the notification bar contents up beside it.
Thisis Thisis	You should never see sponsored videos go see and one plus 6t unsponsored video like Austin evans
Trung Nguyen	Stop complaining, enjoy the device üëå
david daulby	nice phone but i found it hard to take him seriously in this video as all i think of was why linus looks like a wizard
Abdulla Al Neyadi	19.5:9 = 13:6 just saying...
ramakrishna paramahamsa	Please don't behave as a oneplus fan boy even of they sponsor your video.
JCAPlayzGamez	Who else is watching from the USA and thought he was in the USA but just found out hes in canada?
Darren Ng	Still no stereo speakers, and you kinda have to double tap to turn on the phone unlike the OP6 where you can press on the back sensor to directly turn it on.
JeremyDoesStuff	the "draw a C to lauch te camera" is an old thing cuz its present in the asus zenfone 2
Giosy Palmeri	Linus, quick question looking for an answer: OnePlus 6T or Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?
BluTheUnoriginal	The new revolutionary phones are with notch sometimes.
Phaaze	Keeping my V30 for another year. KILL THE NOTCH. BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK.
Oraa Awake	The people who disliked are Apple lovers and users
tanish chandran	Thank God this is sponsored or else u would have made a video on removal of headphone jack
Dagnis Nierlins	2.5mm heaphone jack exists.
sss	I just saw "sponsored by Oneplus" then I am writing this comment and I am gonna be leaving, bye
Jerome Ley	As long as theres a flagship that had a 3.5mm jack, i'll NEVER ever buy a phone without it. Not a chance.
Mokona	R.I.P. One Plus you were a good brand until now.
paul meegan	Its just a phone..same as last one...what a waste of money, all these phone companies are just laughing at us.
Yorkies Bits and Bobs Home Tech	How good is the camera?
XENDER cage	You can't relate with viewers when you get the phone so easily and free. It simply means the phone company will take extra money from consumers to overcome advertisements.
–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤	Toxicity against iPhone... again. How about fuck you Linus?
Kenneth Asibal	bigger battery and removing hp jack thats still interesting

Nil	Why does your sink not have splash back? Lmfao jesus christ and as a former painter that wall color makes me want to bang my head against the ground, bad taste.
Mohd. Ayaan	Does anybody hear condom type case at 4:15
BurntFaceMan	Buying mine the minute they hit the shop. Finally a new phn i actually want. I love my oneplus 3t to bits. Best phn ive ever used , and i work in the mobile/it industry. Oxygen is imho the only way to have android on a phn. Makes samsungs bloated os look like a whale next to a sardine. And the touch screen finger print just blows me away. Its what ive been asking for on a phone for fricking 5 years. Since every godamn phn starting using silly swipe thumb finger prints to silly on the back finger prints... To even the oneplus 3s touchpad reader... Finally an advancement in phones that makes sense..  sadly the camera is not yet hidden and we need a notch, but at least they realised no one fking likes the notch and did their best to get around it.  Top marks.  3700mAh battery... Bonus!  Getting an 8gb 128 asap.
Soukem	I own a OnePlus6 and I don't even use the headphone jack since I have PowerBeats headphones and bluetooth in my car, the jack will disappear anytime soon guys just deal with it it's not a big deal...
Mike Dixon	Bzzzzzzzzzzzztttt! Nope. I will not buy ANY phone with a notch. It's stupid.
Xdew Gaming&More	WHY CAN'T MANUFATURERS KEEP THE 3.5MM HEADPHONE JACK? THIS IS WHY I HAVE TO USE SAMSUNG PHONES!!!
Anton Larchey	If i got it right, on OxygenOS, "hiding the notch" still uses the space for icons, time, etc, but doesn't allow apps to color it.   So it works kinda like a LG V10, perfect implementation imo
Lior Zeno	Still waiting for your pixel 3 review...
malawi tank	W hy the fu...k are you in bed and in bathroops... please dress appropriate. Didnt wanted to watch the video
Steampunk Skunk	I have a one+ 6, been using it for about 6 months.  Its a great phone and I have no regrets about buying it.... such a pity its the last One+ I will own.  I bought it over a pixel because it had a 3.5mm headphone jack.  I drive a work van all day (not mine, my bosses so i cant change the radio).  It has a 3.5mm audio input on its radio and NO BLUETOOTH.  I NEED to be able to plug in a charger AND an audio output AT THE SAME TIME.  Bluetooth is not an option for me.
Abu Syed	A moment of silence for the fallen soldier...the headphone jack   Press F to pay respects
CallMeNumber8	NO HEADPHONE JACK NO SALE!
Bsc information Technology	mi mix 3 is better and cheaper
a y o e	So tl:dr, it has an on screen fingerprint reader? Wowwee, imma go throw money at my local phone vendor. /s
Jaime Barjau Vallet	I was looking forward to change my 3T. Not without headphone jack.
EnGeRus	the only phone I would buy for much money would be a true 4k res. samsung bc of gear vr. no else function could convince me ever
treehouse722	I like this channel, but it's really weird to accept sponsorship from the company who make the product you're reviewing. That's especially true when it's a brand new product at release time that you'd be reviewing anyway. Yes, you criticise the lack of a headphone jack here, but the whole review just feels compromised. I have no problem with sponsorship in general, but not like this.
FIGHTTHECABLE	Still a notch!
Marijn Stollenga	Oneplus is going straight after Apple, they left the field wide open and there are so many points where this is phone is simply better than one that costs 2 times the price. And by now it's easier to use.
UTKARSH PATEL	*Let's wait till xiomi come up with same thing with half of the price and headphone jack*
Trevor Floren	Looks great, almost perfect. But I still like my 3.5mm jack! Phone manufactures need to look at these comment sections and see how many people they're turning off to their phones.
Adam Azman	they remove headphone jack to increase the battery size? like razer phone?
üÖµüÜÑüÖºüÖ∏üÖæ	I hate how he exaggerate the on display fingerprint scanner and dew drop notch as if one plus had them first.
Luca Jackson	Should I get this or the Pixel 3 XL?
Stephen Wouw	Suddenly everyone is an audiophile...The headphone jack must be preserved!! aargh...  You can make photo's without editing and without carrying around big bulky camera's, you can film to if you so¬† inclined.. have almost bezel less display with great resolution, and is powerful enough to play games as well.¬† And at the price point an absolute steal.   BUT THE HEADPHONE JACK.....  seriously WTF
kamal khan	Best price to performance ratio ever been. ....
olemasolu	Linus always kills it
MrcabooseVG	Getting rid of headphone jacks is a good way to get me to not even consider your phone
BotPlayer Legacy	A headphone jack is rare. So samsung and LG are in top 2 situation here
Loki27	Garbage phone from a garbage company...never again.
Josh Jeggs	Did this idiot really say "condom type case"
gyan deep	background music is soo distracting :(
JCY Jeff	And no mention of the camera?
Ranjan Pai	Like/dislike Why not subscribe/unsubscribe xD
Peanut Brain	When Linus said coffee he wasn't kidding
Shanansn Dmsnns	Paid review
Lorenzo Atencia	i hate chinese phones. okay #scam #fake
G B	Wait, if you're sleeping with OnePlus, how can we ever trust you????? EH??????
Dylan Lewis	No headphone jack was the deal breaker for me. Apple has started some terrible trends in this industry. I'm sure some can live without it, but I have no patience for a bulky dongle with usb-c and 3.5mm inputs. New technology should always be more convenient and elegant in usage. Dongles are a kludge.
chen yonghong	So tell me, how many times do you fuck this phone last night?
Amanda Karpur	More and more the iPhones get expensive, better it is for other mobile companies. They can increase the price and still say we are better and cheaper than iPhones...
Aarib Anwar	Wait, then what‚Äôs the price of the one plus 6 now?
S7 Studio	the not'ch looks like a nipple
maisun monowar	What do you think about Mix 3?
Sean Wiblin	Me at first: ‚Äúwow this seems to be a great upgrade. I was gonna get the OnePlus Six anyways.‚Äù  Me after realizing no headphone jack: ‚Äúguess I‚Äôm getting a OnePlus Six anyways.‚Äù  What problem are they solving by removing the headphone jack?
N-ninja	I was in the need of a new phone recently and this pulls my interest... but that headphone jack is a srs deal breaker...   Has anyone made a mod yet which adds an 3.5mm jack back on like with the iphones?
Kaneki ken	You should really list what songs you use in the background.
Ethan Butler-Amos	But how's the camera. Silly sponsored video
StarFighter2000	So what's worse, removing a fucking headphone jack or bone cancer in children? Some of you are SERIOUSLY acting as if it's the latter which is fucking embarrassing.  Use bluetooth headphones like everybody else or put the goddamn dongle in and shut your bitchmade ass up.
Jesus Rivera	The day they make battery-free Bluetooth headphones, That's the day I will give up the headphone jack on my devices! I been a 1+ user since the 1+1, I have bought every 1+ phone because they always offer me more for my money but lately I feel like they have gone lazy with designs and instead of being leaders, they are happy to be followers. Currently have a 1+5T and I think this is were I stop. I hate the notch and I hate the fact they got rid of the jack. LG or Samsung will be my next choice. It's been fun 1+....
BloatDestiny	Definitely gonna pick up a Oneplus 6T in exchange for my S7 with a cracked screen. The lack of aux doesn't bother me and the tear drop notch looks pretty slick in my opinion.
Adam Monaghan	Looks like Dongle and Notch are the new Tango and Cash..
Guru darshan	Its completely copied by oppos r Series phone.
RemuCSGO	I've been rocking the 5T for a year and to me it's the perfect phone. Well almost. Only thing it's missing is that under-screen fingerprint reader :D
fra.carol	Screen off gestures were already present in the zenfone 2 ages ago
ÍπÄÍ∑ºÏòÅ	idk... the price is really good but I wish I had no notch though its small and had a 3.5mm jack. wish I could spend like 50 bucks more and get 3.5mm jack and get lid of damn notch madness. I know we can hide the notch but its still right there if the light gets reflected on the screen and I DO NOT WANT IT.
james wasda	This will very likely be my next phone if it's open to Verizon.
Alexandre Morais	I really wanted that IP68 cert on this phone, but everything else about it its awesome! But I'll keep my S8 for a little longer I guess :(
Alex Chong	what is T maen?
Gravity Gamer	Samsung is making a under display camera for their s10 which has no bezel!!!
Mohit Gupta	Oppo, Vivo & OnePlus is owned by BBk electronics
Adam Coulter	Audio sounds muffled in this video
DastiRDTV	I don't know if many others also feel this way, but personally I wouldn't buy a phone without a headphone jack. I rarely use it, but when I do, it's nice to have.
Jeffrey Binns	love my Op6, 6T appears to be another WIN... Apple who? Samsung what?
KH Ovikul Alam Orko	3 Finger swipe is a XIAOMI feature <3
Eru Ryuzaki	Nice video as always but what did you do to the sound - it sounds quite dull? I definitely appreciate the high standards that you usually use to provide :)   Just so you see at least someone cares.
Mad SimplyœÄ	Overhyped piece of trash.
Impetusk	I prefer that "not a notch" features as a pimple.
kevin mashru	Headphone jack doesn't bother me. Is it just me or someone else thinks that.
Dipak Gupta	Condom type case üëÄ
DFox Review	WRONG, it is not OnePluses approach it is OPPOs approach.
rrobotman	Enjoyed this review - thanks Linus nicely done and very informative.
random guy	Don't worry guys, OnePlus wrote the script and Linus got sponsored. Win-win solution.
Meem Ain	I would‚Äôve bought the phone       If it had A HEADPHONE JACK  Samsung and LG are our only hope now
Someone	Disappointed in OnePlus
Ramesses	No headphone jack. Samsung, we're counting on you.
Laurence Bajao	better to wait for 7T
m3morales _	it‚Äôs hard to look away from this gorgeous phone !
FURIOUS JAKE13	0:16 that was more of a squished kidney than a heart
Karl Massie	here is a thought making these screens bigger less bezels shrinking the notch JUST GET RID OF THE STUPID NOTCH
Mohit Jangir	Hey guys!!! Should I buy this one or  last one?
Sandeep Hulse	if you are a music lover, please take your time, install the same music app on both iphone se and one plus anything , ofcourse use the same headset, compare , it will be blow your mind, I have not used any other iphones, just wanted to check iOS , the user experience of iOS plus the music and the simplicity of the iPhone se just blew me away, beleive when I say this iPhone SE is one of the last phones which is giving you the best music experience, I want to use iPhones but I want my 3.5 mm jack... it is sad...
Tanmay 2003	3 finger screenshot was a thing in xiaomi devices way back than this
Marxone	Still using OnePlus One. Still no reason to upgrade it. Sad.
Ultrime	When I heard talking about dropping,I thought he was gonna plug in MASSDROP
Oskar Miko≈Çajczyk	Wait, is it a sponsored review? Well, that‚Äôs an oxymoron...
Andr√©e Lind	Linus you need to shave my man
FloatingGoat	I really want this phone but I still have the OP5 and there's nothing wrong with it. Often, phones get slower over time but mine doesn't. The 8gb RAM is amazing and the processor as well. And let's not forget the fantastic OxygenOS on top of Android. The fact that OP keeps updating older phones is really good as well.
Croft	It's a lot of money, but compared to the competition getting flagship specs and innovation like an under-screen fingerprint reader for under $600 is pretty sweet. The prices charged by the other manufacturers are so high it makes me want to scream "rape".
Parag Gadge	One Plus design team is dead. Legit dead. Will we ever see another masterpiece like the One Plus 1 or 2?! One plus is definitely making the trials with the Oppo series phones and then fine tuning it to get it on the One Plus Series. Absolute garbage.
Bergatrollet	Hey, what happend too the camra test!??ü§®

Khim Mai	not'chüòÇ
Christian Risch	I can understand people being frustrated of a removed headphone jack, but I think a fairly large portion of those are just frustrated to be frustrated, and only a small amount is really concerned about audio-quality.  You see when you are going for a run, riding your bike to work or sitting in the bus/train, you are in a public space and are surrounded by noise and also have to be observant about traffic noises and other stuff. So you should not wear full isolated headphones and blast a high volume on your ears to stay observant and safe. In this conditions you cant appreciate the better sound of a high-quality deck and cable-headphones against a good pair of bt-headphones in my opinion. On my trips to university and now to work I couldn't really distinguish the sound of my sasmusng s7 wired or wireless. I know this is about casual audio-consumption but lets face it, the majority of you people out there are also just casually listening to music while doing other stuff.  And now for the audiophiles that say, they want the best possible sound with their high quality wired headphones, listening to beethovens 5th at home. Yes, it sucks, that more and more phones do that to you. But also, the best audio-experience you can have will never come from a phone in the first place. Thats what we have home audio systems for. To praise the standard 3,5mm jack in every phone that still has it, is bullshit in my eyes. The quality of sound you get from there will pale to a home audio system, with a 4,5mm jack. You will never get the studio-quality sound you want from a smartphone, so nothing is really lost here too.  I love the convenience of wireless headphones more then the "inconvenience" of charging another device. My JBL 50BT last for around 20 hours, so I have to charge them like every 4 weeks since i mainly use them for my travel to work. Also while running I always have the proplem, that the cable of wired headphones under my shirt slowly pulls the speakers out of my ears what is really annoying. Having to charge them every 4 weeks for about 2 hours doesnt seem so bad to me.  Yes it is a dick move that companies try to force you to buiy bt-headphones or dongles. Yes it is shit that you cant use your nice headphones on your new phone out of the box. Yes it may seem inconvenient to not being able to charge and listen at the same time or having to take an extra dongle with you.  But honestly I have not have these issues yet. My phone is always charged enough to enjoy a long time of hearing podcasts or watching videos with non-3,5 wired headphones, The quality of sound is very good with my BT-Headphones, I havent experienced delays or dropouts and i can let my phone lay in the living room, whil i listen to music in the bathroom while cleaning the shower.  It is a downgrade, but in my eyes such a minor downgrade, that doesnt really deserve so much focus and attention. And it shouldn't be such a dealbreaker for so many people.
ShroudedWolf51	Tiny notch, but it's still a notch. Just what I want in my device. I have a video playing that has a chunk missing, or a game that I can't control properly because the chunk that's missing is eliminating a bit of the controls. Perfect. Also, turning off the pixels is not a proper solution, because now the aspect ratio is fucked. Fuck the magic camera, fuck the notch. The bezel is fine. Nobody is going to cry themselves to sleep at night because of a tiny bezel.  Oh, and the real deal breaker, the fucking headphone jack being gone. And, it's such a shame. The rest of the phone seems like a pretty nifty device...even if I'm not going to use certain aspects of it. Like the fingerprint reader, since I actually care about security.
BrainlessDude	I must say im really pissed off! OnePlus wanted to be the competitor without being so pricey aand without shitting on their customers.   Now we pay more and more every generation and they act just like the big companys. No 3,5mm headphone jack? Are you nuts?!  Well. I guess I will just stay with my 3T. No need for me to say goodbye to my perfect device and get a pricey Samsung clone.
Jason	nice one this is
Wouter Kamperman	I used to be passed they started removing audio jacks but now all my audio devices are Bluetooth anyways so now my jack just gets really dirty
Eagle 367	If they are taking away the 3.5 they should at least give us 2 USB c ports on these damned devices so we can use wired headphones while charging or devices. Stop being sucky smartphone companies and give us 2 ports whether the 3.5 or the extra usb-c
Naing Aung Lu Lu	In 3:10 min of video , he spoil the future of next inovative of Oneplus phone.
RealBloodstorm	nice phone, if it had IP waterproofing i would buy it... For now ill stick to my S8+
Abdul Hameed	The only guy who reviews a new smartphone in pajamas ! LIT
Outdoor Andy	I use an external mic with my phone often, so, no 3.5 is a no go for me.
Andrew Montague	I have the 3T and I'm due to upgrade in the next couple of months. I can't decide if I want the 6T or to shift elsewhere. Hopeful there will be a review of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 as that is looking super keen on price and pretty cool too.
Da Brickbat	The thing these reviews don't tell you is that after 2 years oneplus stopped releasing software updates, screwing over their own customers.  Never buying another oneplus.
Rahul Talreja	Wondering what would Linus's review be if one plus hadn't sponsored it. Not sure if great tech like this needs to do anything like this.
Prabhat Kumar Singh	canadian hoe sells himself out to a Chinese company for a cheap phone

Vytautas V	Theres no headphone jack. Im not buying
TuKeZ	camera comparison?
pdscoelho	The headphone jack isn't a big deal, just use the adapter, one plus of not having the jack (sexy pun right) is that you get better water resistance with less ports. Who are these people that need to listen to audio while it charges? You literally get hours of music playback just with a 15 minute charge. Overall I like the improvements especially the larger battery, they kicked it up a notch (hot damn, ok ok that ones old). They should add wireless charging though, is that really going to add much to the cost? Did Linus even mention it lacks that?
Norbitek25	Forget the headphone jack, just grab a Sound Blaster E5 and you will be able to use your favourite headphones and get excellent audio quality.
Abinash Pal	All of a sudden Oneplus seems not costly looking at the iPhone price.....
Cutie Dumitru	op 6 right here, in my hand, is still very good phone, and the notch is not a problem as you can disable it in the same way as 6t
Novin Davis	Is it better than Mi Mix 3 which comes out at 474$ ?? .. why pay 549$ for same spec of OnePlus 6  No Headphone Jack  No notification LED
Calsefire	Ahaha the phone box looked like a box of tissues.
Oliver Wootton	Does the OP6T have an LED notification indicator?
sanwal farooque	No fingerprint sensor. He tapped the glass to confirm it wasn't there  @00:59
jose silvestre serna medina	Why does this feels like when everybody was making videos about that vacuum cleaner? ._.
Haitian Yue	I have to say almost every new phones in China are as good as Oneplus, but American blocked most Chinese phones from their carriers.
Amanda Amarawansha	LTT Housecoat
J Blando	That comment about them having the good sense of sending you a phone early is so disgusting. You've lost touch, we want the old Linus back. The guy who broke prototypes.

Ryan	6 or 6t?!??! Currently have the iPhone  5s so not gonna notice things like the slightly slower figure print scanner... very conflicted....
Dominic Shiells	They should get a fake front door for Linus media group. This seems one of the best phones this year as it has an under screen finger print sensor and the price is what makes it so reasonable.  Can you do an episode on usb c Vs lightning Vs headphone headphones and analyse which is the best option. I think that is the only letdown.  Is there a big change in audio from using a USBC cable. If apple had the same standard it would make life easier.  I would be interested in an audiophiles perspective
TripleAceAAA	What's better, the one plus 6t or Samsung s10 in a few months? Which one should I get....
Katsuragi	Still have my OP3T going strong, and whenever I am forced to switch I won't even look at another brand. On that note, the jack thing is REALLY stupid, but it wouldn't be a deal breaker for me... it's just the annoyance of having to carry the adapter as well.
Ace Lucero	Great video
A.K. Born	RIP. OnePlus just died cause they removed the aux. Sent from my OnePlus 5t
Moonwaterz	Meizu 16th is still the one for me.

Nitin Kataria	How about giveaways wise guy ?
Boris	The problem with removing the headphone jack is that there are no legitimately good wireless earphone options outside of the airpods (I dont even like Apple). So I feel like that was a questionable call. But the rest of the phone is definitely looking better than most other flagships out there for the price.

pavitra shukla	No headphones jack is a deal breaker for me since i play PUBG mobile pretty heavily while charging the phone and the Bluetooth headphones have a considerable audio lag while playing games also there are issues chatting with Bluetooth headphones. I prefer wired headphones. Bye bye one plus will much rather wait for pocofone F2 or Asus Rog phone
Bobby Blades	your mom is a chin bar
Trukkerkeps	Notches are deal breakers. Absolutely disgusting design. Also, I will not spend more than $500 on a smartphone, pref less than $400.
Jason Leung	Oh man...Linus bought by Oneplus. This phone obviously sucks, all the trade-offs are for the underglass optical fingerprint, which has inferior security. At least Apple put the dot projector FaceID. Not to mention no water proof, no wireless charging

Nitesh Maharaj	We want a bigger battery. We want an under screen fingerprint sensor. OnePlus: sure we‚Äôll hook you up... oh but there‚Äôs not enough room, so we‚Äôll have to sacrifice the headphone jack.  Everyone: I will never buy this phone because they took away my headphone jack.  Honestly extracting blood from a rock won‚Äôt make Fandroids happy. I guess you have to truly experience AirPods to realize how horrible cables are.

Shaikh Har	Just look at the comments and surely one would realize how valuable Headphone jack as a feature still is for people! Without iphones making it trendy these other wannabe iphones wouldnt have guts to remove features that is useful.
Tyler Clarke	Ok maybe i'm just using my phone all wrong here, I pretty regularly charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. If all audio peripherals are going to USB C then give me two USB C ports. Call me old fashioned I like my I/O.

Javier Arocho	And people think that the iPhone XS and even the XR are price justified???  OnePlus offers so much for a great price, without trying to justify with excuses like OLED screen or camera, or LTE Gigabit, or extra RAM, or built materiales prices boost!!!  Apple just try to scam us!!!
Bradford D'souza	I get it, removing the headphone jack is a big deal. But is it really? Initially, I too was dead against it when Apple first removed it. But now that all other manufacturers are heading in the same direction, it got me thinking...how much of an inconvenience is it really? Headphone users are of two types,  1. Bluetooth headphone users who won't have any issue with the removal of the headphone jack and  2. Wired headphone users who just have to keep the provided dongle attached to their exisiting headphones of choice in whatever bag / pouch / pocket they're already carrying their wired headphones in. Which IMO isn't THAT big a deal as people are making it out to be. For eg: Calling it a deal breaker for an otherwise really great phone.

Erizon Santos	Linus what does you're wife think about the overhead rig set up in the kitchen?
JJ Hades	I think you should try Mate20pro
AviAceC130	I'm glad Samsung is keeping the headphone jack
Sam Meng	He's the best I love his videos
Antonio Santana	Is don't know why people cry about the headphone jack, I've been a Bluetooth audio user for years and sometimes a USB C for maximum quality audio. It's just a step forward.
Nate Youmans	People still want the headphone jack. The iPhone 7 was released in late 2016, 2 years ago. If USB C was truly superior and people wanted it instead of the 3.5 mm, OnePlus, Google, etc removing it wouldn't be surprising. Also, realistically, no one makes USB C headphones. 3.5mm works plenty good. Most people want a headphone jack. Stop copying the things that make Apple suck. The notch, the headphone jack, gluing in batteries etc. Copy Apple's nearly seamless ecosystem. Copy Apple's understandable and reliable interface. Don't copy the things that make them suck because that makes *you* suck. Sorry for the rant, been watching a lot of Louis lately.
Dremekeks	*Linus, that thumbnail makes you look like my Dad.*
Zamir shaikh	If they are send 6t to almost all YouTubers then what is the meaning of event üòÇüòÇ
Florian Gutbier	ohh dear linus is nude .. . sort of .. cant be unseen
Max	But it's still too big. Bring back the 5" phone :(
Benito Llan Matos	3:20 *WE KNOW*
lil sence	i dont understand why 1k dislikes
David Kirkwood	Put a shirt on plz
Amatsu	sponsored >:D
sgomez8194	between this phone and the pixel 3 which one would be the better buy?
Gary Perreault	probably like 800$ in canada
Brooklyn TheFurry	the notch looks like a essential phone knock off
Yushan Yasindu	We don't need in display fingerprint scaner please add headfone jack for god said.
Th3RaiN RaiN	Sub to pewds
patdud1979	That phone would have been my new phone but only if was compatible with Vid√©otron üòî iPhone will probably be my next choice.
JR Claridad	It's funny that what kept me from buying other phones other than my note 9 is the audio jack. I don't want to say goodbye to my wired headphones that I find expensive.
Sunny Ahuja	OnePlus 6T gets launched, every YouTube reviewer puts their review, no cons in a single video. I mean they couldn't even get rid of a chin.
Egg Dude	Swear to god they took out the jac because it would have more of a chin, personally I think if they find a way around it they will bring it back. This is one plus, they listen to the people
CHNCAT	Hi R17 S845 ver
Adam J	No led notification light fail
LiteGaming Mobile	Ermagerd no headphone jack!!!!
Logan Otto	Is It gonna be compatible with verizon?
Abdul Ahad Siddiqui	Only Linus can pull off an entire video in a bathrobe ...

RRooooooNNNN	Linus Robe Tips
Julien Groulx	The sound feels really muffled, it's pretty weird.
Jeremiah Gavin	Dongle and notch, NOPE. I even own BT headphones but I NEED the headphone jack, that one time when you need the jack is worth a lesser set of specs. In my opinion that is.
Matthew Acheampong	Bye bye notification LED
Navdeep Singh	5:05 were u trying to use finger print sensor on back..
William Toothpick	Damn Linus couldn't even bother to get dressed for this review ü§®ü§î
Jb Rone	One plus 6t looks amazing but id rather have no camera, shorter battery life,  a weaker screen, no water proof and a headphone jack. look like i'm going to need to find a different phone once i'm ready to move on from my 5T.
Todd Pie	A house coat???? WTF... it's called a dressing gown....
3rd World Garage	My 21 year old pickup truck has a 3.5 mm headphone jack and this phone does not. Sorry but the lack of integration with my beater truck/life partner means I will pass on this phone.
bobwinslow	Okay, I've waited to say something but I AM LOVING THESE INTROS/writing as of late. I've been subbed since 2013, and it's fun as hell.
Anthony Dawson	I guess that‚Äôs why Linus gives Apple such poor reviews - no free phone, no free flight to events - no thick envelope full of cashüòÇ
Blesson Kuriakose	u should wear unicorn pajamas that would be cool
hurty	Seriously considering this... wow!
Josh Ruth	I want an LTT housecoat!!!
Charles Yeo	Linus practicing his dad speech
JustinHEMI	I hope someday I can get one on Verizon.
Anthony Paull	Happy with my Note 9 but I will be considering OnePlus again next time I upgrade. I had the OnePlus One for several years until I upgraded to the S8+ and it was a phenomenal phone for the day. Paid under 500 aud for it and it trounced most other flagships in just about every area for the first year. Still have it today and aside from some battery issues it still works perfectly.
Tek	I think this could be the best Android device that you can buy!
Gilbert V	I literally just got an iPhone Max and I‚Äôm regretting my choice :(
Pau Ges	How about Mate 20 Pro review Linus?
So Eshon Karkee	Oneplus :- baby notch Apple :- Father notch Pixel :- Grandpa notch
CKT1138	No headphone jack? Seriously? I don't comprehend this mass stupidity!
nick shambrook	No Audio jack I‚Äôm actually about to cry üò¢
James L	Bought the OnePlus 5 at launch, was waiting for my case to arrive, went to the theaters and it slipped out of my pocket about 2ft from the floor...still cracked the screen...  Needless to say I am not too confident in Corning Gorilla glass...
rolo francia	Shirtless Linus? Now you have my attention.
AM Motorsport	before I watch this video... NO HEADPHONE JACK AND A NOTCH. No thanks, I'm out. Note 9 is STILL king AND it can be purchased new for $699 now, with all the features the 6T doesn't have. In a nut shell on the 6T is lacking in multiple areas: 3340/3700 mAh battery Notch No expandable storage No headphone jack no waterproof rating SMALLER 1080p screen (with no-notch function on) MUCH less camera than other options  Who buys this garbage when better stuff exists?
Gilbert Plays ‚òÜ #1 Gaming Channel	Linus Lewd Tips
Shibab Haider	Y 1+ Y the missing jack
Kriss Singhania	these mobile tech youtube channels got paid for promoting this shit phone
Mike Hoon	Doesn't have a headphone jack. Not interested in the product. Will find new vendor for phones in future.
ChloeWade	ew that chin, no faceid that shit trash.
Hontas Farmer	The phone looks awesome.   Know it all rant on the notion of a 100% screen to body ratio follows.       Ah the notion of a under screen camera. A tiny pin hole camera of some kind would mean a bad image.  A camera's resolving power depends on gathering as many photons of light as possible focusing them on a photosensor.   At some point the camera would pick up light from the screen itself.  Theoretically 95% screen to body ratio is about the maximum.  If the phone is 100mm long at least 5mm has to be set aside for sensors, and someplace to hold it.
bowen.	Now that the 6T is out i can afford the base 6!!
Mark Kowalski	Good morning honey
Forbidden Office Derby	Please stop sooking about no headphone jack, move on. Dongle life is real
Pard SaysHi	I want to see more memes!
LovelessFascinations	zammnnn daddy linus
Lars Bolduc	One notable missing feature is the notification LED. Like woah.
Vladimir Byazrov	OnePlus just humiliated not only Google with their craPixels but also Apple with their even crappier iphones. Thank you, OnePlus!
Jonathon Raby	I absolutely love the way they made the notch look. Super sleek and not in your face like on my X. Also it's a lot of phone for the money.
Aaron Rizk	Really nice phone it's a shame it doesn't havs a headphone jack though as it might have been my next phone really need an upgrade from my s6 xD
Jamil Saleh	given the fact that it has a larger battery (which is one of the only *real* reasons to ditch the 3.5 mm jack), I think it was a fair way to move up. The bullets wireless are also fantastic and support        dash charge, so maybe look into those if you plan on picking up this boi
Darren Wood	Why are all the android manufacturers handing sales to Samsung by removing the headphone jack? Apple can do it because their customers have no choice, they have to bend over and cop it. Android manufacturer removes feature? Just move to Samsung lol
Rolen Okumura	Loved the video, just the audio sounds a bit like you are under water Linus
Anthoney Tracey	Linus Phone Tips
Admiral Percy	Please don't ever appear shirtless on camera again.
FastLikeUNO	Linus laid a OP6T???
Hooda Plays	So should we wait for one plus 7 or buy 6t
Tommy Landry	I got the OnePlus 3t for 2 years now and, still, no sign of software programmed slow down ''to save the old battery'' which is still largely lasting me over a full day and charge back in 1~h
Basadict	@6:02 üôÑ I've never clicked this much on a timestamp. Autotune is shooketh.
The Basics	Good way of destroying charging port by using the headphones & chargers at the same port . I can't even imagine how many times I charge my mobile & listen to music with my headphones by pushing & pulling
Jay Jones	Get your oneplus 6t on November 1st, with 20$ off of any accessory, here: https://www.oneplus.com/invite#HOUQG9MMN37LHEA
James M	A real man would be butt naked in his kitchen making breakfast.
Vali Zeth	Linus.. the king of odd intros.
Josh	Top quality video. Nice.
J024	1+ upping their game once again. Yes to the housecoat!
Dovah Kiin	I'm sold! What do you think guys 6gb or 8gb for $20 more?
MrNangle	I‚Äôm getting it for Christmas, going to be a massive upgrade for my oneplus 3, their phones last so long, keeping the 6t for another 3 years.
Graam	Thank you for teaching me about the 3 finger swipe for screenshots, I enabled in on my OnePlus 2 and it is working great!
Jake Musser	Okay. So I use my phone for music every day (Probably for a cumulative 2-3 hours per day at minimum), so headphone jack is a major issue. But I want to hear from people who have swapped to phones without a headphone jack AND frequently use their phones for music. How much did the change inconvenience you? Has the sound quality gone down? Did you buy a premium wireless earbuds and were they worth it? I don't have a problem with the notch, and I can swallow no SD Card since there's so much storage, but the headphone jack is important. If it's gone, what's the major effects of it?
Jaco van der Merwe	It's funny how YouTubers say that the mechanic cameras which pops in and out " isn't proven to last 8n the long run" while switching phone every two or three months
Nathan Nguyen	my iphone xs already last year's tech :/
var1328	No reason for this phone to have a glass back - now it‚Äôs a fragile glass sandwich ü•™    That is a step down from metal back phones.   They should make phones out of rubber so they will bounce when you drop them
Mo shatla	you should all check linus talking at 1.5 speed xD
Ayush Raj	test the mix three its a gorgeous phome with 10 gb ram and 5g support with a front camera sliding mechanism
Exterme oGaming	Even if he is sponsored.... He is still linus.. rep++
Dudeofdawn	you ever do a full review of OnePlus 6T in a robe just to flex on Gamer's Nexus?
Peyton Royce	As it is sponsored by the company so linus only said good things about the product.
eWizard	I'd be down with this if it were on project fi. I'm also a huge fan of gesture controls on rear-facing scanners, but I could probably live without that.
Patensoxa Show	Don't worry baby the galaxy s10 gonna wipe out that notch and bessel
Zaha Lc	Grab mi mix3 and you are done
Lal Mazuala	Mi mix 3 is more value for money than Op6t.
PANTOLON YILANI	Were you actually fucking that phone?
able724	Yes, get House Coats!  Big Thick Terry Cloth House Coats with the LTT logo embroidered on the left breast pocket.  Those would be so awesome!  The downside to this phone is that it's only available on T-Mobile.
Viktor Milenkovic	Is it just me or there's smth wrong with the sound? . _ .  The "How does Fingerprint under display work" has ALOT better sound then this video . _ .
Josh Guyette	Love it, 2:45... I hate notches 10 time more that you do. :)
Johnny C	Please never do another intro from your bed. Otherwise keep up the good work.
Crushenator500	Did they pay extra to have you present their phone in a robe?
AP_Maquina	but, is the camera good? no one is giving me a solid answer just a "well its better than before" I want to know how much better man. I gotta drop serious change on these phone whenever I decide to upgrade lol
crazymonkeyboom	My only gripe is no headphone jack
Harte TCur	True.
dinesh reddy	he looks like Danny D brother in bedüòÇ
Bradley Hove	Still not a fan of sponsored reviews
Daniel Cufino	Hopefully the 3T I currently have is eligible for trade in because if so I'm definitely getting the 6T!
MYtested Official	this still honest review for me with label sponsored
Carlos Dudas	no expandable storage, no headphone jack, no wireless charging, and no rated waterproofing, hard pass at that price point.
Michael Hammer	I guess i'm keeping my iPhone 6s with the headphone jack
Aaron Chandra	does it come in any other color other than black? does it have stereo speakers?
Rudyard Arocha	Linus videos and oneplus - both do well at what they should do
KWEE	Half way in the video I just realized he was in a robe ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nad Kudo	yeah... totally lost me with the lack of 3.5 port... shame :/
Sujan Sharma	Huawei mate 20 pro's in-screen fingerprint scanner is insanely fast as compared to the 1+6T
Crimson	No headphone jack no buy
BurnDaTree	OnePlus 6T = 61
Verlin Swarey	Never saw someone standing in their kitchen in a bathrobe doing a review before! I loved it. Linus is serious about what he does,but always manages to keep it freshüëç
Âä†Ë≥Ä	why don't they just give us 2 usbc ports if they like dongles so much :l
Professor Neila	Is no one going to talk about linus being topless in a soft comfy bed?!
vipin yadav	Awesome deviceüëç‚úåÔ∏è
Geo	Still too big.
ronindebeatrice	Can we just loop Linus as Daddy telling me he's disappointed? It's not a kink.
Anonymous Toes	How does it perform in bed and what can you do with that notch? ‡≤†_‡≤†
GenericAdolescent	it was going to be my best phone, but they didn't have a headphone jack. I would have bought it, but that is a deal breaker for me.
John Douglas	why are they all glass backed?  I don't want friken glass, it CRACKS!   grrr.  and as for "slick" or "proffessional"  bullshit, it's just slippery and shit.
Eleventeen O'Clock	you won't find any other reviewer reviewing this phone in a bathrobe :)
astrophysx	mi mix 3
Austin Duff	Lynus looks like weird al in the thumbnail
LT1 _ Sam	This is a gorgeous phone.... but I just got the onePlus 5T earlier this year....and have no reason to upgrade.
TheSPAZZANATER	how about a phone under $400? something that us pre-paid people would like. or someone like me that are in the trades that would break a phone once a year or so.
CF L	No jack no buy
Varun Maharaj	i really wanted this not to sound great because of the pocophone
arjun	1:11 kinda feels like a cooking show
Alf Blue	Im really confused which to get, 6 or 6t ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Joshua Vanderburg	Let's find out if this phone is any good or not... Sponsored by the people who made the phone!
chopper's place	sorry i don't trust any reviews of products that are sponsored by the very company that makes them...i appreciate the full disclosure, however.
caleb Hall	What's the music at 1:20
alan joseph	Can the OnePlus 6 get the indisplay finger print scanner
Swanubhav Jain	Please do a camera comparison between OnePlus 6T, Pixel 3XL, iphone Xs Max, Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Huawei Mate 20 pro
Nicholas Wilks	when you like everything that isn't apple, your reviews look less reliable.

BenJAMin for a day or two.	Never noticed how pretty Linus's eye were before this...No homo
seontonppa	"Speaking of dropping stuff..." I already exit fullscreen before noticing there is not going to be another ad in this ad.

big BYTES	@linus do checkout mix3
Synth Love	I feel like I just bought the 5T
Hellmo Sandvich	Be really hard to trade in my knock feature from LG. I'm kind of addicted to it.
Justice Forall	I‚Äôm very critical of smartphones with a notch. But actually, this one is sort of cool. Plus you can hide it if you want. And the price? Oh my God! You can not beat that price! I use to be critical of the headphone jack. But now, I rather have a wireless headphone jack. Because the cord gets in the way and you can easily snatch it out of the phone and bend the metal, leaving you with only one of the earbuds working, or none. The fingerprint reader under the class, now how cool is that? Instead of buying an Apple iPhone, I‚Äôd rather buy 2 of these. One for me and one for my sister who‚Äôs an AppleHolic. I meant... Apple Fan Girl! I meant... Apple user! ü§≠üò¨üòÑüòÄüòÇ
Brandon Lombardo	If they can keep this price point for a while for thier new phones they will do EXTREMELY well
Elite Arfuz	Hey Linus you didn't review Poco F1
John A.	How about getting rid of the front facing camera all together, put a small "selfie" screen on the back to allow you to use and see the cameras back there at the same time, and no notch on the front at all needed. you could also use this as face ID, though I will admit that would be slightly less convenient for that feature.
ansarirayyan	IS THIS BETTER THAN THE PH-1 (other than the non-ceramic back) wish it had headphone jack cuz USB-C audio is actually bad
Sloth	Everyone still reacts like this is the first time someone has removed the headphone jack.. like really?
Legend The Boring	Specs ?
G_Manitie	Wow this phone is pretty sweet might actually get it
Craig Elliott	Linus. your look obscenely arousing in this video... hmmmmmmm gigidy :P
pink Fungi	wow  i can't believe everyone is ignoring mi mix 3 shame on you linus.
Crazy Harry the Muppet	How are the speakers? Are they still mono?
Hector F. Torres	Well 3.5 jack is out because of BT stereo, Wireless speakers and selling BT headphones will make them more money and even in cars that now come ready for Android Auto, Carplay and BT so no need for an extra cable!
LiveToRide RideToLive	I bought the one plus 6 and its a realy good phone but apps on android are STILL TO THIS DAY LAGGING BEHIND ,one beeing snapchat. i could take better snaps on my iphone 6 that came out years ago and its realy fucking anoying becouse it shouldnt be like that.
Fabian	If I understood the live stream right, I can send my OnePlus 5 to them, get 300$ and buy a OnePlus 6T with them? (well, euros instead of dollars, but idk how that works yet). Do I need to backup it myself etc, or will they be able to just move my data to the new one? Would be quite annoying to not having any phone for a week or how long this needs. Anyone know more? :D
Parag D	Frankly, I have a 6, and I've used charging and headphones together just twice. I feel removing that jack is justified.
RiseAndShine	I'll wait for oneplus 7.
strife	Stop it with the eyeliner
Dylan Milton	OPPO has had those gestures for a long time. üôÉ
username3017	no headphone jack, no buy
The Insane Bolt!	Removing the headphonejack has no benefits STOP
YoYoBIOS YoYoBIOS	The smartphone industry is trying to cut costs a few cents. Also this is the day and age where manufacturers are trying to sell stuff for tenfold the the price they buy it at from slave labour shops. Apple has initiated the hyperprofit margin buisiness model. Capitalism is going in overdrive.
GAEB DOBLAN	The only reason i watch linustechtips is to watch linus do cringy shit
Lorena	Eh this phone doesn't impress me.
Iskandar Arif	please do a video on the mi mix 3 and give your thoughts
Jaime Gerena	Sd 845?
Bryce Prince	So is the beginning portion of the video your way of saying you're in bed with One Plus? Haha. Love your videos, just wish I had a more even perspective on One Plus phones from one of my favorite tech Youtubers :P

StarGateSG7	Your comment at 2:27 about:  "....I would prefer some sort of magic Camera under the Screen..."   CAN BE made real...IF...OLED/LED screen manufacturers would group their main display pixels into the SQUARE format of:  RG BC  R = Red pixel OLED emitter G = Green pixel OLED emitter B = Blue pixel OLED emitter C = Stacked RGB CMOS camera photosite  where THREE pixels are used for emitting RGB (Red Green Blue) colour and ONE pixel is used as a photosensitive pixel site. Since one pixel can STILL have A STACKED RGB sensor (very much like Sigma's revolutionary Foveon sensor) where you can get colour photos and video FROM the screen itself. What Sigma does is stack the Red, Green and Blue sensitive layers on top of another so that a SINGLE photosite can read all three bands (RGB) of light and smartphone screen makers can do the same.  This means three pixels emit light and one pixel is used to SENSE light! So if you use a DCI UHD (4096 by 2160 pixels) screen you would get incredible good 8 megapixel images of INCREDIBLE light-gathering power (i.e. a SUPER LOW-LIGHT camera) because the camera photosites would be AS LARGE AS the screen pixel light emitters. That means each photosite would have so much light gathering power because of modern  smartphone screens having pixels quite a bit being larger than 30 microns so that TRUE nightvision would be a practical ability on a modern smartphone.  If you use a DCI 8k by 4k (8192 by 4320 pixel - 32 megapixels) smartphone screen, then your photosite sizes would STILL be over 15 microns for ultra low-light still photo and video capabilities. This is MUCH BETTER than ANY other modern smartphone camera! SO YES you CAN make a combined camera embedded as part of the pixels in an OLED/LED screen. --- This above idea is NOW DEFINED AS AN OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE design created by StargateSG7 (aka the person known by the initials HAE) licenced under the GNU GPLV3 General Public Licence applied to hardware designs!
saad sati	actually it will not be shipped with dangle the one you got is pr package not what the actual consumer
Dan Ross	These thumbnails are maddening. You should understand that you don't need to clickbait and make a over-saturated stupid thumbnail for people to watch your video. Go look at every other successful channel that doesn't resort to that...
Ripskin16	I still love my 5T.  I originally was very wary of the fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, especially since half of the day it sits on my desk at work.  But it is in a spot that for anything meaningful I have to pick it up anyway.  I have now found it more convenient 80% of the time to have the sensor where it is on the 5T.  Though there are times I would love one on the front as well.  Doubt we'll get both for a long time but its so easy to unlock as I pull the phone out of my pocket and maintain a firm grip on it.    The loss of the earphone jack seems meaningless to me.  I still loathe glass phones, no point and "wireless" charging is still a gimmick.   If I did not have a 5T I would definitely pick up the 6T.  For now, not enough of an upgrade.  I love the price for what you get though I think the 256 version is a bit on the pricey side for what 1+ usually offers on the 'high' end of their stuff.  I hope that does not continue.
lance c	So you can draw an O to open the camera, and a M to launch maps, so does that mean I can program it when I draw a P it will open my mass amounts of porn? Just asking for a friend.
CnF C.W P	"Not" "ch"
Parker Hartzler	I have a one plus one and I'm literally clutching my savings shaking furiously waiting for November 1st to get here
LunarSpotlight	Not sure what a "house coat" is, but custom bath robes would be a novel idea.
RndmThtz	Do you have to touch another button in order to "wake" the screen so that the fingerprint sensor will be activated?
Alessandro Mele	Thank you. You're still maing a big deal out of dropping the headphone jack. I love my 1+5T, but I'll never buy a phone with no headphone jack, so looks like Samsung will be my next brand?
aaron Cooper	Meh Phone ... they need to reel the phone back to just , Phone calls and the odd browsing.  its getting crazy now, an they charge the price of a full PC build for it.  then make you pay a premium to keep it !

Lord V1LE	I don‚Äôt get the fingerprint reader under the screen. It‚Äôs slower than normal sensors and FaceID. Isn‚Äôt as secure as either and doesn‚Äôt work when crap is on the detector which both of the other options do.
Marcosmos747	let's see what's under that robe bb
Eric Kelley	absolute unit
Roscoe	I'm not sure which way I prefer cause that may make screen repairs way more expensive and I tend to drop phones a lot (also it could stop working due to a screen crack). Also I wouldn't like if it needed pressure since I tend to already have greasy fingers. I also NEED a 3.5mm jack, I don't want to also carry and maybe break the dongle.

Jake Lewis	Love my OnePlus 6! Might be pawning it off on the wife and get the 6T.
Hideto Matsumoto	Linus, you‚Äôre a sellout. How could anyone take a paid review seriously?
Sanjay SudevanS	No wireless charging no improvements in camera is disappointing  but same price is not at all. We want more +1 from others üòé
Jan Ryan	What's with the bathing suit? At least with iJustine we know her studio is her actual real operating kitchen. Your level of pretend is weird.
cecilyt006	Poseur.
Miguel Angel	Funny how people bitch about the price of phones. Yet forget its not the companies fault but the consumers. Did no one learn to buy with in their own price range? Can‚Äôt afford it, well too bad. There are plenty of people who can spend 700+ on a phone with a dent on their wallet
Steve Lee	They ditched the headphone jack presumably to make room for larger battery and under screen fingerprint reader. Honestly 6 is still the best compromise and given the choice today I would grab myself a 6 while there is still stock. Given that performance wise they are literally the same.
Kuchheara Sokhan	‚ÄúThe phone has a screen protector pre-applied and a transparent condom type case‚Äù üòÇ

AsSiMiLaTeD77	Are you guys planning to do a full review of this one?
Tom Sullivan	Linus, you probably won't see this, but maybe look at the Asus Zenfone 5 or 5z. I was looking for a new phone that still had a headphone jack, a clean OS, cheapish, and not a stupid huge notch. I like mine!
DMOC3	Finally!!!!!!! A One Plus product that will work on Verizon.
Imagi Williams	They had me until I saw the dongle, and looked up if it had wireless charging or not. Which it doesn't.

Rowun	Everyone seems to be so mad about the headphone jack, tbh it‚Äôs actually a good thing in my opinion. It leaves space for the  larger battery and finger print censor. I have an iPhone 5s and haven‚Äôt had a headphone jack for about 1 year (it broke). Trust me. You don‚Äôt miss it.
Isaac Rios	I was about to say " *i have to get this phone* " then i saw the usb c adapter
IRockerbacon	LTT should review the Mi Mix 3
SushiSlicer	niceee
Malfunctioning Android	Damn. I was looking towards 6t as a candidate for an upgrade. But...no 3.5mm jack - no buy.
H E A V Y	Microphone sound is not that good on this video with what you are wearing
YatzsE	Do the OP6 cases fit the 6t?
SC G	The loss of the headphone jack is sad but this seems like a pretty good phone
Obsidian 999	One way mirror technology hopefully will produce a camera quality experience with full screen ability, because I don't like the notch with companies try to avoid return to the bevel.
Adam Weaver	So they took the vivo nex s fingerprint scanner and the realme 2 pro notch. Nothing new.
Gzoe4real gameratheart	Shouldn't the fingure print be located on the side of the phone or power button instead of the screen looks more of a natural position from holding the phone. Just saying
Dilly Turbo	I love your shoes linus
ww998w[Gamel]	And Asus zenfone 5z still have 3.5 jack
Flanky Suittably	5:20 as i remember my old sony can already do that lol
funkierfawn budgie	To make this phone absolutely almost perfect, OnePlus should've made headphone jack, made wireless charging, micro SD capable, and there you go
Mr. Dragon	Great video. LTT continuing to give you the best of both worlds, entertainment and information.
ProPlayerBrian	so, is it possible to unlock the phone screen with the screen off since there is no always on display? or is that not possible and would you still first have to pick it up or use the button on the side?
Luke Zeng	Linus your math skill makes this video unwatchable.
Minecrafter55666	That box looks just like the nexus 6 box! xD
KoyotBravo	No jack, not buying. Ever.
Chief Buddy	anohter great quote from Linus "Thank You smart people over there"
Isaac Roufs	I love the 60!
theendofit	At this rate I think I may get a 7t as my next phone still happy with my s8+ I'll hold onto it till its damaged or having any kind of issue.
Rockman Gonzalez	Linus is low key an asshole.
Jack McCourt	The headphone jack is an ancient analog input that takes up significant space in the phone... Stop being a bunch of snowflakes and use the damn usb-c port!
Skryre1080	A sponsored review? C'mon now...
Tom√°≈° Konkoƒæ	IP rating ??..... Wake up guys... Thank you Linus nice preview. Why you guys always crying about IP rating? One drop cracked glass and rating gone. Try warranty claim on any phone with IP rating for water damage without any visible marks or cracks, good luck. All manufacturers have warranty void if liquid enter in to device no matter what rating they have.

Tad the Gryphon	would have been a buy, but no ip rating, no expandable storage, and no headphone jack make it a yawn.
Alaura	Skip skip skip skip downvoted skipped skipped skipped skipped. Your videos are shit, your shit, your shit at making videos, and you should just delete your channels, disband your fucking company, and kill yourself.
John Ramhos	Also, having the finger print scanner on the front is waaay safer when wanting to unlock the screen when driving.  I have a dashboard holder and when it locks, it's pain in the ass  having to take it of  the holder to unlock the screen.
GeneralReticent	Linus the audio is garbage on this video. Did you record this with the Pixel 3?
Anderson Tavarez	Samsung is better than Apple! CHANGE MY MIND!!!
Omniknight	I might actually consider this phone. But damn OnePlus for removing the Headphone jack. Damn you to hell.
SupahAmbition	Linus how am I suppose to know if this is a review or not. It looks like a review, feels like a review and tastes like a review but it's sponsored.
DopeMan	Let's be serious, the oppo find X is awesome, and if they remove the motor and make it a pull and push mechanism that slides up and down you'd have something absolutely amazing. Leaving a more expensive version to have the motorized version.
shahrom ab rahman	1 + 6t = error
Kurt SD	Video is amazing... Just disappointed lol
Arian Winanto	am I the only one who prefers battery life and shock resistant phone without case than bezel size
MasterReptile25	Hopefully we can have this tech on the new iPhone that are going to be released in September
Lance Grieser	I'd buy an LTT/LMG plush house coat!.  :)
Aiden Gulliford	Triangle notch !?!? I would prefer the pixel 3‚Äôs notch !
Technolocic	Sponsored review  >:(
big Johnson	Wait he said a pre applied condom damn with that protection I'm sold
Kwistenbiebel200	I have a One Plus 5 WITH headphone jack, woohoo :). Aaaaaaand NO NOTCH, yeaaaaah :)......aaaaaaand a finger sensor ON THE FRONT.....aaaaaaand ALL CHEAPER than current so called budget phones, double whammy!........so I am not upgrading, woohoo!
AEP-World	No headphone jack! fucking disgusting!
Arjun K V	Reviews paid by the company are literally the lowest this channel has gotten. Though the phone is really great and Linus is generally really good. Still disappointed guys, all I ask is no paid reviews.Please get other sponsors for reviews not the company that you are reviewing. That's it. I have no problem with sponsors. i feel like it's not a really big ask.
Ady Pahuja	Zenfone 5z is still better. At this price point you can buy lg g7 thinQ with IP 68/69 rating and wireless charging and built in quad dac for audio. 5z comes with a built in amp too and is cheaper than oneplus 6. They both have 3.5mm jack too. Then there is mi mix 3 which provides wireless charger in the box and still cheaper than op6t. OP going on the footsteps of apple.
Adam Rasmussen	Papa Linus!
billyhatcher643	that pisses me off that they retardedly removed the headphone jack i mean come on u guys what a dick move stop fallowing apple and stand up and say people still use headset jacks i still use my galaxy s5 jack also the no headset jack is  a no sale on my end i dont want to buy a phone that has no headset jack
Spala	nooooo whhyyyyy oneplus the headphone jack just whhhyyyy
Hemot San	What is your coffee?
Gaurav Koshti	Can we get speed test between iPhone XS face id and in screen fingerprint scanner in one plus 6t..!!??ü•¥
Ciggo Smoke'O Doggo	Did he say "condom tight" @ 4:12
BeagleBagel	This will be a really good upgrade from my Iphone 4s hahahaha
To Pi	Jesus this is supposed to be a video about the OnePlus 6T not the iPhone hate video...... here is the deal.... if you don't like Apple no one is asking you to buy it or use it.... this has just gotten stupid.
Nisco Racing	500+ dollars is not really affordable for most! But i guess bloatware free has a price these days.
Anonymimus	No SD slot, no headphone jack and no removable battery. These are the thing I just hate about modern smartphones. Especially the last one. The removable battery still makes my S3 superior to the Note 9 in my opinion.

MrChevyv8	I'm sorry, but releasing 2 videos of one phone a day, one officially sponsored, one a review, is just bullshit, TBH. Even if you were 100% unbiased and objective, this is just not acceptable in my humble opinion. I don't have issues with your videos in general, but something like this is just way too obvious (no matter if you're biased or not), even for people not watching every video.
Kei Kurono	why the heck is it so cheap?
Lewys Cousins	I can't wait another week for it I need it now üòÇ
Vincent Feliciano	"transparent condom type case"
SoulTurtle	I am pretty sure that Linus still have some eyeliner on from last video
Jonathan Hirschbaum	Wasnt the whole propaganda of jack about waterproofing? Or they already admitted that this is everything about closing the analog gap so finally DRM will make sense? Every sane tech person should beat the fuck out of the idea of removing analog sound connector or you will pay for even fukin ringtone and there will NOT be any way to record it and copy. But hey Linus, it's you who is tech guy, arent you? IM just random folk from internet. Yet another bollox to charge is an extra perk
Joshua McCarty	I just don't understand why they have holes on both sides of the bottom giving the impression they have speakers on both sides but dont
xTransmission	Screw this, pocophone is the new budget king.
ReV3nBe	3:29 I was expecting you to announce todays sponsor
Aaron	Headphone jacks are dead people.  Get over it.  I wonder how are you JackBoys are gonna react when Samsung pulls it from a future phone, which they will.
mrk107	Nice bedroom scene Linus.
Vladimir Rusu	When he shot the screenshot with 3 fingers I was like "but wait a minute, that feature is implemented in lineage os since Android N" and instantly tried it. Custom ROMs are the best.
GuvernorDave	Daddy linus made me feel so guilty and I didn't even do anything.
richard wang	Well watched a 7 minute ad
ATTIC	Plus les ann√©es passe, plus la vie deviens chers. Dans le passe acheter un smartphone a 500$ c'etait fou mtn 1500$-2000$
Andrian Lee	Woooww... It makes a HUGE different when you review "Sponsored" phone ü§£ü§£.
Offensive Nut	Neighbors Dog: I'd like to interest you in my OnePlus(tm) 6T(r).
Pinormous	For the price, definitely no complaints. It's not the "no compromises" Samsung, but it also comes at a much more digestible price without giving up hardware performance or aesthetics. If it had an IP rating, this would definitely be replacing my first gen Pixel, and might still.
TrueRegulators	Wireless charging?
Valentin Radu	No headphone jack, no buy. C'mon, why ditch it, the phone is gianormous anyway, and I'd sacrifice 5 minutes of battery for an actual method of listen ingto music while charging. OnePlus, disappointing as usual.
sunny steve	I see any type of notch I just cringe.
s7yler	No words about the missing notification LED? Or did I miss that part?.....
Burgattti	Ngl with dash charge not too worried about no jack but id sitkl rather have it, but now that my oneplus 3 is dying this is the only phone I think I want
ThatGuyRed	Still not buying anything with a notch
Sander Honig	Seriously considering buying this gorgeous piece of technology
iiIsaacii_	*Wooo sexy linus intro*
First Name Last Name	Big company like Apple want to go full wireless in every device. Wired technology is old school. Everything should wireless now. "But wireless thing is expensive" Thats why we start now, when everything is wireless, wireless become common and of course its become cheap. We need big company to start with,  but company like samsung dont want it because thats what consumer like it. Come on guys, we need to move on to wireless era.   im not apple fanboy
Jordan L	Holly Shit it has a touchscreen!!"
Lumpy Mushroom	I was a One plus man to the very end, but the removal of the head phone jack is a backward-ass way of promoting a "Flagship killer". Normally you improve upon flagship phones while keeping a budget friendly price. Guess we'll have to potentially wait for a One Plus 6T-S to just include a headphone jack with a slightly faster processor. -_-
GhaV jGRite (jeaHAvee)	Linus is in bed with OnePlus.
Victor Hassan	is it 60 or 6t?
Dorraj	I love everything about it, minus the notch, and lack of a headphone jack. Also, 1080p? What is this, 2015?
Andrew Smart	if the camera is eventually able to be moved to under the screen, would it also be moved into the centre of the screen or stay at the top like they have always been?
Darkside1355	The notch aint to bad but they got rid of EVERYTHING we actually liked oneplus for  For that price they better put everything back and some new stuff, i want my  headphone jack Wireless charging Water resistance Dual Sim SD Card  Yea put all that shit on the phone then ill buy it at that price point, maybe even a little bit more.
Chief Chavez	Anyone have the name of the track playing throughout the video? Thanks.
Timothy Tsang	Kids cry about not having a headphone jack.
Muzzled	No audio jack means no purchase from me and litterally every person I've talked to about the lack of one, very disappointing considering how great my oneplus 3 is.
the one you dont see	i wish someone would make a phone without a selfie camera for those that dont care about selfies but still care about screen to body ratio witch would be easier without selfie camera
You are my rock.	No one's commenting on the intro? Video was sponsored by OnePlus, Linus is seen in bed with the OnePlus 6T. So Linus is in bed with OnePlus...
Samuel Castillo	e seen very good android cell phones, but oneplus is an experience different from the others. It's not a big deal but it gives you sastifacciln to know that you have a reliable phone in your hands.
DanielloOWNS	That's why you should test Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 ;)
Noah hunter	I saw that unbox therapy moment...

LA	I still need IP certification and wireless charging. until then I'm on my iPhone X.
Slobodan Tosovic	The fast charger shade was deserved but the home button on iPhone 8 was just another reason why i dislike him.
Dan on the go	no headphone jack = useless phone :(
Jara FPV	no headphone jack ... nice - no thanks 6T Is the world of mobile phones trying to introduce us now to bluetooth headphones?
CrazyKyle101	iPhone skipped 9 so they could get "X" before samsung
MrNotSo Pink	Was considering this or the v30 but the lack of headphone jack has basically answered my question about what to get
CyrenArkade	OnePlus: Hey who likes headphone jacks? People: 90% of us need headphone jacks! OnePlus: Haha, fuck a you!
Albert Chen	no headphone jack, no ip rating, no wireless charge. No thanks.
Dennis Vlaanderen	I was pretty excited when I saw this in my feed. And the video was great and honestly almost enticed me to finally upgrade my 1+ 5, but then came the USB-C headphone bullshit.  No thanks.
TrafalgarLaw	5:36 caught lackin'
R Houde	Rather have no headphone jack than a notch
Lawdie	Saw a notch, suddenly lost interest
Hydrochloric Acid	The one thing i did not need to see was Linus shirtless in bed

Flames Tornado	No headphone jacküö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Princess Luna	Soo, you're wearing lipstick?
ricardo brito	When is linus leaving the closet
Lewis M	What about the speaker? Did they improve the speaker or not?
jumpar	It's a cool phone for sure but I don't really see any point in upgrading from my 5t. They both do the same.
job Van Asselt	Am i the only one who is questioning why the aspect ratio is 19.5 it is just weird, will it have then in every video bars?
R X	Good phone nothing bad to say about it.
Bradley Irving	*nice*
jasson k	Im still happy with my 5t. No notch, and yes head phone jack.
Hydra	Nah, I prefer the Pixel 3XL's notch
Wild Heart	The OnePlus 3T was one of the most amazing phones I've ever tried, but I ditched it, largely because it was just *too* darn big. I'm totally with you regarding the Fingerprint Scanner on the front.I don't want to have to pick my phone up every time I use it and if this works flat on the table I'd still be tempted and you can hide that bloody notch too! ;O)
Tom Morley	Audio sounds a little muddy in this video
parabola1024	Good hands-on review....still the most punchable face on YouTube.
Michael Archer	about time that headphone jack was gone, now a phone worth buying.:-)
ImBleu	I love the 6T, but having had my OnePlus One & OnePlus 3 be destroyed by water damage, and with how much I use my Wireless charger, I'm unsure if I can really make the jump back from my Note 8 to the OnePlus 6T. The Headphone jack doesn't matter but I deliberately skipped the Note 9 waiting for this device and it is a little disappointing.
jamin russell	That's a weeird aspect ratio 19.5:9
biso sresta	üòÇüòÇüòÇ a what case???
Jack INGROUILLE	well it was either a headphone jack or the underscreen fingerprint reader and a slightly larger battery
N N	In the last 20 min. Everyone has a OnePlus 6t Video
shahmir durrani	You pull shit at the razer Phonse and don't say anything about how shit the OnePlus 6t speakers are they are easily covered and aren't even stereo
Harys Viewty	Oh man you have a very sexy armpit üòâ
DnL	That smaller "notch" is actually not that bad, better than the other big or very big ones. But no headphone jack? Nah... That's really disappointing.
SUK MIKE HOK l	No notch and headphone jack will pass , thank you samsung, waiting for note 10.

William Taylor	I hate the note9, but that's really all there is this Christmas, 600mhz Zulu antenna, cricket has 650mhz, but it's no upgrade.  On 700mhz, in 3g on market Street, Holly balls, but only 4 thousand dollar phones b have 600mhz, god damn looser dust.  In free air, you can Store fiber optic signature, so .4 miles from the towers, even 25 miles, it just lacks both antenna technology and pure CPU power.  Because any http in self autonomous, it just is independent.
Luis Maiocchi	God, I wish apple didn't remove the headphone jack. I hope other phone manufacturers don't follow suit. And why the glass back?
Pavel Pekun	OnePlus time is out.
Cory RS	Welp I'm not willing to give up headphone jack so I'm going to have to pass on this one. Yikes.
Klarald Blok	''you were the chosen one, it was said you would destroy the dongles, not join them!''
x factores	I see everyone complaining about the 6T not having a headphone jack and that bluetooth audio quality is shit but most of us are listening to shitty mp3 or streamed music who's even shittier than mp3 sometimes... so don't tell me you can hear a difference between bluetooth and 3.5mm jack it's pure bullshit. And even if you're listening to flac or aac music, is your wired headphones good enough for that ?
StarSn1per	I don't understand all the fuss about the thumbprint scanners.. It's lame.
razza 83	Can't believe people buy finger print scanning phones. Idiots.
Chris Notyourbusines	im a rlly big fan of honest videos sponsored by the company which product is beeing reviewed..but should it not just be called ` "advertising" ?
Dean Fransen	Linus, $579 minus $549 = $30 So 6:18, it's an extra 30 dollar, not $20
Aornum	Just take my money OnePlus.
VenomSnake03	N I C E
Kronocide	"Notch has reduced since last year"  Linus , you need to take a break . It's been only 5 months since the OP6 was released.
mkd1r	"Sponsored by OnePlus", thumbs down and closed. Oh and btw, glass is glass you moron, regardless of its propaganda name. Glass breaks and scratches always the same.

Anorkhil	I came, saw a notch, threw up in my mouth, disliked and left. . .  mi mix 3 all the way
tOmzz4video	Haven't said anything about the recent mobile phone trends in a while, but;  1. Bezels aren't that huge of a deal, I personally haven't had an issue with bezels of phone from like 5 years ago (just a nice round value, no models in particular). Yes, more screen within same form factor is great, but the better grip and fewer angles to shatter the screen are much more preferable, to me at least. Gorilla glass improvements are great, but even with the testing shown in this video, my old phone had survived much more relying purely on a basic rubber case and solid frame to handle the impact.  On top of which, there's no need to deal with annoying workarounds to hiding the front facing camera and all the sensors and speakers...  2. Under screen finger print scanner. This is one of the most sci-fi, futuristic improvements within mobile technology that I've seen (second to only display size improvements). However, at the end of the day, at least to me it seems like a gimmic, offering nothing of substance that couldn't have been done before (in terms of biometric authentication, not the innovation)  3. Removing headphone jack for "improvements" I've mentioned in previous two points, just isn't worth it. These trends have essentially taken responsibility out of the manufacturers and placed it into consumer hands. There are numerous reasons for doing so (i.e. easier manufacturing, more products to sell, more "features" to cram inside the device), but at the end of the day instead of carrying the device and headphones, now there's the need for a dongle, which apart from introducing another point of failure (as there's an additional step to establish a connection) will be easily lost...  Ideally, and being optimistic this trend will end as other consumer good manufacturers will embrace the USB-C standard, however if anyone wants to use higher quality headphones, I don't see that becoming an option for quite few years...
Techno PC	No jack? No one+ 6T.
albin maccarthy	Linux were you masturbating? Where's your woman?
Drunk Asian	apple. im mad and disappointed. they charge you 500 for less yet i know they can make better fucking products but they dont. Oneplus on the other hand im just grateful for them they are amazing
„ÄéBlank„Äè	The tiny notch is nicr but the lack of headphone jack isn't
heretolevitateme	I can't believe (i'm supposed to believe that) Linus sleeps in those earrings.
Reverse Thinker	I like the sarcasm of linus by unboxing "phone" In night dress he don't give a fuck about small tech always focus on junky tech like super computers and fancy gadgets. Not like MKBHD so called Tech channel with only SMARTPHONE Based content.
cyphre	Headphone jack aside, that actually seems to be a compelling option compared to other flagships. Unless I'm missing something in the specs.
Vinh Ngo	No offense to OnePlus, I love them. But are there any cons?
gaftie	just buy a year old samsung, sony, LG flagship
Stefan Sch√∂llauf	The moment he said: " speaking of dropping stuff" i instantly thought he will introduce massdrop as a sponsor. That would have been another great transition. :')
KT Channel	Not much has changed and they ditched the 3.5mm port..
Josh Parkinson	All the people whining about the headphone jack are completely forgetting that OP made the compromise to give stereo audio (finally) and a larger battery. Not saying it's a good thing that the 3.5mm jack is gone, and it certainly made me get the 6 instead of waiting, but there are upsides.
T.E.D. de Medici	Samsung remains the only notchless, jack included flagship phone company it would seem.
Seryous	Best review style so far. Was amused. Again!
Benji Shamata	Dad Linus is amazing
finite tuning	I don't understand the head phone thing, where you complimenting or condemning? I also don't understand those who would spend even $500 on a stupid phone, unless you have special needs. I have a vernee V2 pro and it's way overkill for anything I could do with a phone, plus it's water proof, drop proof with all you'd expect in a tough phone for the low low price of $200. It's got all the same basic bells and whistles for a fraction of the cost and my battery lasts over a week! Go look it up, the V2 pro is damn hard to beat.

rajat tiwari	Why the f**k are u starting the video in bed
kada peep	everyone is crying because they removed the jack... i will buy the C-Bullets
Bres Saga	you should do a video about whether 6 gb or 8gb ram for phone is better
Nikolas Manuelides	that top camera looks like shit, the rest of the video was great
J B	Hold on... this is a hands on review of the OnePlus 6t sponsored by OnePlus .... sounds like the making of a non-bias review Linus
Moin Uddin	NO HEADPHONE JACK???
Dwayne Attard	What about wireless charging
Mark Bevan	Is it me or does Linus look like he is related to Hutch ?
Mitchell M.	Legend has it that Linus was fully nude under those covers ;)
Richard Miller	No headphone jack, no phone
brandon dymock	review the mate 20 pro
Dukkiegamer	I even got quick charge with my Moto Z2 Play. It should be included with every phone.
WyldeGi	*He sleeps with phone boxes* üòÇ
Kieran Daly	New world record, Linus unbox a phone and review in his jammies and 7 minutes flat
Aayush Shrestha	0:08 you can see linus tits. Thank me later :P :P
Cyberspirit	One thing that I absolutely love about my 5T is that I can just swipe down on the FP sensor to open the notification bar. I think it's a really great feature and I'm sad to see that it's gone now. I guess I'll just hope that in a couple generations there will be something like that. Until then it's 5T all the way for me.
Chris O' Niall	That intro was sexy as fuck And Linus with Dad glasses, I came
TheAwakenHD	No headphone jack is plain stupid .
Gooplus Blows	So another company goes the route of Apple these companies need tobhave some originalbideas and maybe ask the community that buy their phones what they want. If samsung delete the headphone jack that will be it no more new phones for me
Craig Lillie	3 fingered screenshot?  Welcome to Moto E5 Plus. ;)
D B COOPER	Linus needs a few more earrings to complete the 80s look
SleepyGames	Who's watching this on their oneplus 6 :(
Nathan Fletcher	No 3.5mm audio jack = no but regardless of the other features
Pach | New Video!	why tf is he calling his dressing down a house coat
Karl P	With good wireless earpieces is there any downside to not having a headphone jack anymore?
Dominic Kuhn	make a review of the pocophone
Khepralife	Linus and Chris Pirillo sound alike.
Reginaldo Dias	3:11  Hi Linus you forgot to mention The Mi Mix 3 approach here. Wich I suppose is the best implementation for the time being.
Trym	The Huawei Already has the under-screen fingerprint scanner
bagpopuk	The 3.5mm headphone jack is the most robust and reliable outlet for headphones, period. It's been around forever and it just works, forever. I've got a phone with a USB type C dongle and it lasted all of 3 months. The 3.5mm jack's omission from a cutting edge phone is a seriously flawed marketing decision; penny wise, pound/dollar foolish!
BenDoesUTube	Can tell this is a sponsored video, go check out Austin's review if you want an unbiased opinion...
Purple ezaH	Still Not better than Huawei... P20 PRO and Mate20 pro are just way ahead of the others
Toine de winter	Okay, the things I was looking forward it has it, mostly, I would want an IP eating and wireless charging and the this phone would be golden
hi im shana	Wait what, iPhone XS Max doesn‚Äôt come with a phone jack converter in the box?  That‚Äôs lame
Dick Cheney	I not trying to hate, but this dude has a very punchable face
Yashlyn Naidoo	That looks like iJustine's house, Linus...
Xenon Games	Mia kHalIFA IS that  you ?
Maksimilan Mel√∏	Best fucking skit ever.  I am not angry.... Just... Disappointed.
Dom_112202	So you suck it off because you are sponsored? üòÇ
Soham Naskar	Removing the headphone jack is so not OnePlus... Dissapointing.
ARRESTEDPAIN	Can we make dissapointed dad a new meme...
Unknown	i can't download headphone jack, fuckin sucks
zycane	8GB ram?! not even Apple's Ipad Pro line has 8GB... yet.
Luciel Campbell	Regardless of the 6T, you mentioned about the notch that it had been made a lot smaller compared to "Last Year". However, the Oneplus 6 came out in May 2018 (i.e. this year). I like OnePlus but this kind of pisses me off, another phone so fast? Makes me wonder if the 6 was a rushed product and/or they saved tech/featured for the 6T.
Phlox	House coat yes
Spike132544	If this phone had a headphone jack, i would consider buying one even though i have a Note 8 just so i could have a backup phone.... That is the only thing (and from the looks of it the comments generally agree) that this phone has gotten wrong/is missing
Lu Kas	with 3.5mm jack it would be THE perfect phone DAMN IT OnePlus ;)
Samer Abdallah	3:31 "speaking of dropping stuff" and i immediately press escape, then realised  the video is still in the middle and there is more than just ads left
Adam Khan	I was so expecting someone else to get out that bed but as a joke someone male, aside that I love the effort put into this video, the silly antics are entertaining.
Master Wrath	$1000 phone with all the gadgets vs give up 3.5mm jacks... Go fuck yourself one plus, freakin apple brown noser's.
Michael B	They should have left the headphone jack and also put a 4000k battery ( sorry  one plus i am not going to buy it  . water proof? Micro SD? This is a FAIL and for $629 this is not budget
jeffscomp	It looks like a nice phone ‚òéÔ∏è
Matoro Rocks	That's why I want a Note 9. No Dongles, and no Notch
yrkifluz	Noice..
Mitch L	‚ÄúTransparent condom type case‚Äù.
Pablo Casiano	Super impressed! They have done a phenomenal job! Bravo!!! This should make the other Android phone makers hide their faces.
Three Pandas	Why so casual?
A Coskun	LINUS WHERE IS GOOGLE PIXEL 3 FFS?
azikurniaaa	Review pixel 3 please
Anubis	I have been waiting for this phone for so long...
Goliath	For anyone saying to accept the headphone jack removal trend and has the audacity to say to 'get over it': go fuck yourself, you can because you're spineless and don't mind being used as a fucktoy.
Aaron Wood	Any excuse to be shirtless...
Keine Ahnung	Why no comment on the camera????
Cobalt	I want an android phone that respects my privacy.
Kenneth Schoen	When are you doing Pixel 3 reviews?
Maximum667722	XIAOMI MIX 3 for best no notch design. Surprised Linus did not mention it when comparing to Vivo and Oppo
Mr Poop	I always just use Bluetooth headphones nowadays. Not having an audio jack is not an issue at all.   Note: On my personal consumption of bluetooth headphones, it last me a week before i charge it for 2hrs. There is no frequent charging hassle to me at all.
Jamie Lievesley	This is just the same as the Oppo R17 Pro. OnePlus and Oppo have always been the same company. Except Oppo was for regular consumers and OnePlus was the inexpensive Android enthusiast's phone. Seems they're just the same now. So, what other phone's are there that fit the enthusiast bill?
√Çnderson Peroty	I was happy until we reached the part of the 3.5mm jack  = /
Cedric Bien-Aime	Watching this video, I feel like 1)OnePlus really wants Linus to compare their phoen with iPhone's to attract some customers or 2) This is Linus's idea. WE ALREADY GET IT but always talking about it makes me feel like people like Linus are the ones that make Apple such a great company.
Chris Panton	Thank you for showing that the FP unlock can be used with ambient display and that having the display fully on is not needed.
peterk202	Now that this is sponsored it‚Äôs all good. Can‚Äôt trust this guy anymore.
Sadik Tusha	transparent ''condom'' type case
dcha9010	Can you test the sound quality difference between a phone with/without a dongle?
Sr. Rueda	Insanely raped by the Mi Mix 3, only "loosing" in battery (and doesn't have hp jack too). Idk wtf is OnePlus thinking but this is atually GAME OVER. Good job Xiaomi.
Taylor Miller	Can afford the pixel 3 xl. Still prefer oneplus. Sorry, Linus.
≈üƒ∑ƒÖ≈£ƒô≈ï B√∏i	I feel like theres no reason to get rid of the audio jack, it's so small and cheap every phone should have one
pepe	I have a question guys. From the video it looked like u had to press the power button on the side before u could use the fingerprint scanner. Is that true or can u use it directly ?
Tariq Zyoud	The background music sounds like an Apple ad
Rekt.aka.flekt HD	I considered buying IT untul i learmed there is No aux input‚òπÔ∏è
Teodor Kubƒõna	Why does oneplus get so much credit for inscreen fingerprint sensor??? They are not the first nor the best at it. WTF.
Jhesus Qwist	Is he wearing makeup in this video?
Alexander Tsoskounoglou	As face ID improves, it will significantly outperform, fingerprint sensors in security, safety, and convenience.
Steve Mannering	A tech review done in a bathrobe....right after an intro in bed. Linus really likes‚Äã to march/strut to the beat of the demons in his head banging on drums.
Martin van Albruna	Did you miss the Huawei mate 20 that already has an underscreen fingerprint sensor?
Adam Is Me	‚ÄúAnd, there‚Äôs a transparent, condom type case‚Äù.  4:12
Vishnu Deepak	Next step only the boxüòÅüòÅ
Ramy Zurich	1:59 when she sends you nudes
Grey Lawson	MKBHD‚Äôs video explains why no headphone jack
NayoNyan	oh boo-hoo look at me guys im so cool for saying i wont buy a phone without a headphone jack cause i still live in 2010, grow the fuck up
Matt Heitmann	But they still don't support verizon :(. I would buy one if I could! Are you listening One Plus??
M	Seeing Linus Face > PC's > Phones
Heinkel280	condom tight case
Demetrios W	Anyone In support of removing the 3.5 mm jack has never given me a valid point as to why. Phones are getting larger and larger in dimensions a good designer would be able to design around a small 3.5mm jack and it's components giving us superior sound audio and more options. When I'm forced to use my Jaybirds or beats wireless buds it's amazing how depending which pocket my phone is in the audio can drop and sounds 1/10 as good as wired. Maybe people have nice wireless headsets at home, but then why listen to audio through phone and not an amp or system? Keeping the 3.5mm is Freedom to the consumer to use as they wish. Removing the 3.5 is a huge downgrade with not one plus to the consumer.
Strayfe	oh no they removed the headphone jack what am I gonna plug my wireless headphones in to??? Oh wait.. Sorry you guys haven‚Äôt moved on yet, why bitch about wireless charging being removed which charges your phone way slower than a cable but then bitch about removing the headphone jack? The headphone jack pretty much has the same quality as wireless headphones now, they are only a little bit better but unless you have super hearing or blind and your senses have increased dramatically you won‚Äôt notice any difference. Wireless charging isn‚Äôt even close yet, Bluetooth however has been on the grind for YEARS and audio has improved with it. Just being realistic, don‚Äôt hit me with dead facts about the way audio compares because let‚Äôs be real, you guys can‚Äôt tell a major difference at all. You guys probably can‚Äôt even afford top quality to the max 420 wired headphones so why bitch with the quality, absolutely dumb. Wireless earphones can still be a pain with charging and going in to Bluetooth settings to connect and switching to your tablet etc and disconnecting, but a trillion company solved that with their Beats line and AirPods.. I don‚Äôt own an iPhone or these products, but my friend is heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem thing and from what I can tell they are miles ahead. They removed that jack and made it a trend when only Apple should have been the one to remove it, nobody else, all other companies have no justification of removing it since they can‚Äôt meet software demand, Apple has conveniently made it simple, top quality and pretty frickin cool. I now know why Apple charges you loads for their stuff, and not because they brainwash all these Apple sheep kids, they actually make the best. No wonder everyone else copied the notch and removed the jack, everyone is trying to be like them. Samsung still going at it, but that chin AND three useless buttons on the bottom of the screen, still doesn‚Äôt have the software engineered to have justification of making the bezels smaller. From what I can tell people are so mad about removing this stupid headphone jack and not buy the new phone because of it, people can‚Äôt stand change.
King Wavy	Noiceüëåüèæ

The New Indian	you should seriously consider teaching for children. I which I had  a teacher like you in my teen :(
Francisco Costa	Linus, once the French Press coffee brew time is up, get the whole coffee off the container!
Toyratz - Gaming, Tutorials	Most of the comments are about the removal of the headphone jack....
Jacopo Carboncini	Did you harrassed that poor phone under the bed sheets?
Bobby Tornabene	It's weird hearing him not talk about the note 9
Reed W	Im seeing OnePlus slowly become the best phone, for still half the price lol. My next phone will probably be a OnePlus.
Luuk Timmermans	No headphone jack is lame af
DarkAngael	My Huawei P20 came directly with USB type C headset but they also included the dongle with the jack. As far of the case and screen protection I think all Chinese phones come with a transparent case included and screen protector pre-applied.
Babybop Kidsrock	Linus Hefner
S√∂nke Ekn√∂s	In May the OnePlus6 launched. This is getting rediculous....
Joshua Latham	Hey, they're finally a flagship killer again.
Dylan P.	LTT is essentially one big commercial for who ever throws money/tech at them.
IVNCBR Media	Vivo had that design first.
Aquel Aquel	Really? Condom type case? :)) =)) you just .... said oneplus 6T is a .... :))
Luke Vermaas	Goddamn it what's with companies removing functionality
GamerFreakz	Sometimes i think switching to Android but idk ditching the headphone jack is kinda sad
BrayanAlfaroTv2	What‚Äôs up with all the make up?
Raymond Shades	"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed" thats worse than a parent being mad
michael jeacock	or you know, the manual magnetic slider on the mi mix 3.
Birdless	No headphone jack = No buy.
Glen Stelko	No 3.5 jack no buy hahahah this is even worse then ‚Äú720p in 2018?‚Äù comments for XR
Dean Cotton	Samsung will be the only flagship with an audio jack...
Diversity pro	Sub to PiUDiepYe

Robert Martin	TOOLATE I couldn't wait. I went with Huawei
Anthony Sun	Under glass finger print sensor, these Chinese phones are copying again.... Oh, wait..
Diaa Jad	First, what's with the conflict of interest.  Second, you used to roast Apple for removing the headphones jack, but when the 6T does it you mention it in the nicest way possible? I'm truly disappointed Linus.  Well, I think my next phone will be the V40
MiGujack3	So, normal OP6 is better.
Justin Hyde	Housecoat? WTF? You mean a bathrobe?
JOUE BIEN TECH	Ah the cluster fuck that is Usb C audio - with a mismatch of non standard, standard digital and Standard analogue   implementations none of which are compatible with each other.
Gerard Kean	that delay 0:26 "with my" and his hand's down below camera and the blanket is moving
ArminSeiko	But does it use USB 3.x transfer speeds via usb?
loyly	Jedi master Linus teaches you the ways of the tech.
Leon Heess	bad audio
Maxxwell Walt	OnePlus says there is¬† No space for a¬†headphone¬†jack!!!??¬†What's wrong if they just say they've decided to copy Apple..   Vivo Nex S has alomst the same body size as OnePlus 6T, a 6.5" screen on Vivo and a 6.4'' on the 6T. Yet Vivo also has the under the display optical fingerprint reader, a 4000mah¬† (FOUR THOUSAND) Battery, A Motorized POP-UP front facing camera(if you need to see how this¬† Motorized POP-UP camera system takes space go see JerryRigEverything teardown of the Vivo) and Still the Vivo Nex S has the Headphone jack...   These manufactures have just found a way to make people pay more(airpods, pixel buds, bullets) in the name of the future/technology. Well this is not a goodbye to the headphone jack, Its a goodbye to Quality Audio that could be improved to come close to¬†Hi-Fi studio quality audio on-the-go as LG phones do provide.. a least there is a last man standing(LG) ¬†¬†  It's business strategy not engineering issue... Some of you know¬† Strange Parts, the guy who put back the headphone jack on iPhone 7. It's¬† clear that engineering isn't a thing here.. And after all the 3.5mm jack its just a standard audio interface¬†as some compare it with death of PCI,¬† floppy disk¬†and other old tech. It has nothing fancy like MBps throughput or whatsoever.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  So¬† whats dying isn't the headphone jack, its good quality audio and reliability of using these phones.. Thats what's dying.
Suspicious man in a flower costume	Is that Elton John in the thumbnail?

Parado	lol up until the headphone jack I was on board, but that instantly killed it
B .S	Where is my 6.35 jack???
Lucky Dodo	What colours is it available in?
Bipolar Bear	RIP Jack :(
Gpcas9	Tuning off the Pixels beside the Notch does not turn off the notification items!!! they are only white on black! nice!
Steven McGrath	nice.
Digby Dooright	Crap, I thought we were going to see you shirtless. -.-
Cameron Harris	Just my opinion but I prefer a finger print sensor on the back. Feels more natural when picking up the phone and unlocking it at the same time. I also don't like these notch Edge to edge screens, the notch gets in the way and so does your fingers when watching content on your phone. Ideally would like stereo front facing speakers and something to hold on to.
Michael Xie	"Condom-type case" Upvoted for quality content.
alex	of course i press like buttom
The Leviathan	did he just say condom type?
Brendan Smith	Ok but sad that it doesn't have a headphone jack and has a glass back/ is difficult to repair.
Ethan Stoops	Seems to be well priced
Alex lehto	Seriously people crying about headphone jack... I‚Äôve had my iphone x for a year now and i never thought to myself i wish i had a headhone jack, i prefer having 2 speakers on the bottom instead of 1
Markus Wiedner	No headphone jack, fuck this phone
speedfreakpsycho	Khm khm, Family strokes Linus..khm khm if you know what i mean. ;)
Ulmo	Nice of OnePlus to sponsor this absolutely non-biased preview of one of their phones.  AMD should do that for, I don't know, benchmarks or something. But only if they sponsor LTT to do it. Only then is it okay.
J F	Had 2,3,3t,now 6 atm and since 3 im using bt bang&olufsen headphones and since then (3) realised i will never use 3,5mm jack anymore, just no need for it, so im fully supporting this because people, hey it is 2019
sangminlee1234	lol whenever Apple does something different on the iPhone, the whole industry makes fun of them before proceeding to copy them
ThatGuy Silver	Linus dressed like yung gravy
Anon 1	One plus ditches the headphone jack? I ditch the phone.
Just Gusta_Cz	6Ô∏è‚É£üçµ     Also, I know we all hate when someone takes away our beloved headphone jack, but everyone complaining is kinda getting repetitive after a year...  Now don't get me wrong, it's shit move from the manufacturer, but if we want to get somewhere, we have to adapt and change few things, otherwise we'll be still selling the same phones in 2020 or whatever...
DiSiLLUSiON84	Just bought the 6 today instead of waiting for the 6T - and yes, solely for the headphone jack.
X7RM	No headphone jack.... Bye bye
kairon156	I would buy an orange LTT house coat.
Shybe	People are complaining about the headphone jack, but almost everyone‚Äôs ditched it at this point. We can‚Äôt keep clinging to it.
Olivier Larose-de Billy	Oneplus consistently dropping mad flagships... I'm really impressed
TTeaMeister Inspector Tea	I got a 1+ 6t add on this vid

PiPArtemis	Week after week it becomes more evident that I'll be using my S9 for many years to come since I have no desire to use a dongle for my headphones, or shell out $99+ on a decent pair of wireless.  Sad but oh well
_Paws_	Notch'nt?
dictator Friendly	Huawei P20 Pro please ?
x TheWDragon x	everybody : no headphone jack so fuck this phone me: *damn that shits better than my lumia 510* edit (realizing) : *all shits better than my lumia 510*
Brian Liddell	Anyone else find the music towards the end super distracting? The last song before the outro music
Sean O'Brien	That was one of the more positive videos I've seen from LTT in a while
Andy Ferguson	Why are no big YouTube's covering the Huawei mate 20 pro yet?
SirVer	Linus literally in bed with OnePlus LMAO

Crazy Ginger	It doesn't have a headphone jack, it's a shit phone
Uncle G	Wow $600 now that‚Äôs more like it
Addam Robin	No thanks, the 5T is the last phone I'll ever buy from OnePlus If you're copying Apple, I might as well bite the bullet and go for the XS Max Not to mention the OnePlus 7 will probably go for $599/$649/$699 next year
thetruejay20	Nice
viko207	Mi Mix 3 on the list?
EVPointMaster	It looked like a really good phone especially for that price, until you hear about no headphone jack and USB 2.0  And also like pretty much every new phone now, it's way too big. How the hell are you supposed to use it with one hand?
sepehr samadi	There is "not"ch much here to "not"ch like
Michael J Conkright	This phone looks awesome but it is still expensive for me they also took away 3.5mm ugh
iskander Vigoa	sony slt?
Icarus	Before I spend time watching this video, I just want to know if this video is a review of the OP 6T or just a paid advertisement. If this is a review, I am not sure how impartial Linus will be considering the sponsor of this video.
kit kitty	do you have guy liner on at the start in bed?
Hengky Dermanto	What if I put a tempered glass on top of the screen, can it still work similarly without tempered glass on ?
Dailey Woodworks	How is the camera? I‚Äôm still on a iPhone6s plus because upgrading is expensive. And I use my phone‚Äôs camera A Lot. But flagships are ridiculous at this point for something that only lasts a few years
Pookie	I wanna ask why are we getting 8gb ram tho? I mean you are sick bestard if you keep like 654800432 programs in the background,mr.multitasker...and the phones still have such a shit cpu-s that are useless for this much ram...
Jon Krupp	All well and good, but the bathrobe just makes it creepy.
AlexElectric9001	Gorilla glass is shit. I dropped my S8+ from 2 feet up on to the pavement and the screen is cracked to shit. 1 more year until I can upgrade devices (or pay $400+ for a replacement screen).
Mr Awesome Clash	Mmmmm Linus you made my pee pee hard
Braheem Hazeem	Fingerprint scanner on the front..... nope. Also get over your headphone jack, just use Bluetooth it's absolutely fine and you don't need to spend a ton of money for a good pair.
musclesdude	This phone has been renamed by fans to 'OnePlus -1'.
LEEDAQ	if I have to move from my iphone 6s i will buy this one out of all other Android phones, although missing 3.5mm is dog shit
Zach M	Does it still have Audio Tuner (equalizer) built into the software?
EliasAEE	I hate dongle and notch
Jonathan Pollock	All these features  can be found on a $150 phone from china where they are made - why because it's got a name - Products that don't make you money are stupid. You  can buy Gold pills that turn your turds into gold.Take care of your mental health people.
Carlo Stefani	More bedtime with Linus, please üòÇ jokes apart, loved the tone of the video
LRM12o8	Goddamn, now Samsung is the only brand that still has a headphone jack on their flagship phones, right? That's shit, I hate bluetooth! I actually have a couple of Bluetooth devices and it rarely works without issues! Not even on my wireless Sennheiser in-ears that I sometimes use (and my smartwatch is just a watch now because connection is so unstable and drains battery so fast that it's a total fucking nuisance!). Really wanna beat up that idiot who got the idea of removing the headphone jack without offering a viable successor to it.  Because Bluetooth is not a successor, it's just an alternative. It does offer more convenience at times, but is also has quite a bunch of shortcomings compared to the jack.
ttt	cool but can it run minecraft pe?
Russian doge	the notch is ugly af
tyjuji	The headphone jack won't be missed. It's obsolete old tech. Bluetooth and USB headphones will take their place. Price and preference are not good arguments for holding back innovation. If you really cared about audio quality, you'd be using a USB DAC anyway, so that's a moot point.
Kaiser Schnitsel Sr.	one plus in bed ?  them must be condoms
Someone Else	Has Linus ever made a video where he does not do the cringy, juvenile, idiotic two-finger quotation sign?

onni tunturi	1- headphone jack
cMiel	Honestly, I'm not even mad anymore. Fine, sure, take away the jack, I can get cheap wireless headphones on Amazon for 20 bucks, sure. Just please. PLEASE don't take away jacks from PC'S. Because if Apple sets that fucking trend, I will move to China to mod my phones OR make my own smartphone company to cut the bullshit and give the enthusiasts what they REALLY want.
Willy Steinhart	I wonder what the better option is, a 1+ 6t Base model or a s9 for 450‚Ç¨ on black fridayü§î
Mellon Symphonic	Is it review or advertising ?
keto11	NO HEADPHONE JACK O_O NO BUY
ragepoweredgamer	I have a Galaxy S8. I would prefer the phone be DOUBLE the thickness, if I got 40% more battery, dual front facing speakers and a removable battery. Even thicker if I had a slide-out keyboard, honestly. This "thinner is better" is the STUPIDEST mentality of phone makers yet. HTC One m8 had it SO good. The original Motorola Droid? PERFECTION. But THIS? I'm going to actively seek out worse specs for phones if it means keeping things like my 3.5 jack and SD card slot.

James Neave	I really like the power button finger print reader on the right hand edge of my razer phone. And it's battery lasts over a day And it's the only phone I know of with proper "clean" Android. Except pixel devices of course.
Calin Ursu	Does linus know something about under display camera? :-?
Not John Cena	No headphone jack and a notch...‚Ä¶.. But it has a in display fingerprint reader. VERY tiny notch (plus the extra long aspect ratio) and it's less than 600$. Ahhhh. It seems I finally have another competent brand besides Samsung.
Sagerbomb	please stop making hearts with ur hands
mihai popescu	admit or not Apple set the future for phones since birth. All the other manufacturers are copycats¬†period
Matthew Bauer	Everyone is complaining about how it's "wired headphones" or no headphones. I went into Walmart looking specifically for a $50ish par of wired earbuds, something that this time last year, I could have gotten a JBL or a Senheiser or jump up to , heaven forbid, the $99 Beats or Bose... As of Sunday, Walmart isn't selling any wired headphones except for the stuff like the $5 or less OR like the $20 ones that are well over priced, and there isn't many to choose from. I think the days of running into Walmart to pick up a decent wired headphones/wired headset if you are going on a trip or need them for your laptop are over. Even Best Buy is moving towards a >50% stock in Bluetooth headphones/headsets/earbuds, except for the Magnolia stock.
ontario39212	Good production value Linus!  I'm impressed.
truestory	I just wonder how shittier sound quality is going through those usb ports... thank you no thank you. I'll stick to the phones, who do not copy iphones.
Solomon Nwosu	Linus your colthes are inappropriate
Chen Qiu	Looks younger
Rannon	A 256GB storage almost makes up for the lack of storage but removing the headphone jack is a deal breaker! Not to mention the lack of an IP rating but that's not as important.
Kevin Orriss	I'd rather they scrap the selfie camera to go notchless and gain some space for 3.5mm jack
Neal Hill	condom type case.......had me in stitches lolololol

2muchjpop	Can you use a tempered glass screen protector though? Without affecting fingerprint
bouchnak jihed	the only solution  to replace  the headphone jack is to create headphones with USB Type-C  no need for a converter
ATLAS	I am impressed. Exept of the headphone thing...
Mower Moddin	OnePlus really did a good job with this flagship.  If this device was widely advertised, it would be sold everywhere and put every mobile company under the hat.  No compromises yet again
namboozleUK	Is it just me, or is the audio a bit poor on this video? Watching at 4k.
Fx	Notch, no headphone jack, fingerprint scanner on the wrong side. Auto disqualified for me personally
Paranormal Paradox	Holy shit a new phone with a fingerprint scanner. Might just leave Apple again despite my efforts to stay. I‚Äôve always loved the front button
Tyrone Johnson	Demonitized for use of inappropriate content- YouTube team
Ghani Chishty	The Headphone jack... their OWN poll showed people prefer the jack over everything else.. Why take away the choice between the H.Jack, USB C AND Wireless.. they could've added audio/DAC over USB-C & H.Jack to give REAL value.. I'd have taken a 100mAh smaller battery for that... =((
Calvin Redding	nip slip
Albert Sitoe	No phone needs a head phone jack

gingery3k	gracias a dios tengo el 5t con lector atras y sin ceja, lo unico bueno que queda es samsung
PryinBrian	This sort of seems like a higher priced version of the pocophone f1, but LESS features...
Aniket Pawar	Increase in battery capacity doesn't make much sense coz it has dash charging, & in display fingerprints tech is just a show of kinda thing Not much useful slow & annoying...  Notch is still a notch so basically it has nothing just T as suffix... & They removed that much useful hole... Huh disappointing... Tech is getting boring now a days üò™
Xearin	1:23 THANK YOU!
Things You Might Like	Linus looks like he's looking barely above the camera instead of at it. I've never seen that before.
David R. Cohen	for a second i thought hr'd whip out a box of tissues

Vincent Nguyen	I like the notch on the six more cause it kinda reminds me of iron Man and that sound track was great. The 6t notch looks off to me
Brian Gaming	dude, you gotta get your hands on xiaomi mi mix 3
No Pls	If there was a headphone jack, I'd get one. Too bad.
MudSluggerBP	Linus - fingerprint scanner is quick. Austin - fingerprint scanner is a little slow???
Cristian Dobrescu	That's not a notch anymore, it's a nipple.
Rolando Ernesto	Funny
Brandon Lewis	Another one without the head phone jack... RIP
The Magpie	Its funny how we've gone backwards ont he headphone jack, I recently was cleaning my drawers and found a old nokia adapter for my ancient nokia phone which didnt come with a headphone jack, then I found my old original google phone with a head phone jack, then I have my current note 3 still with headphone jack, and now we go backwards again with the current models back to dongles, or if your just blowing money usb-c headphones or bluetooth headphones.. The reasons though this time seem that they claim its so they can fit more tech inside a phone (good luck with that the headphone jack is tiny), but really its so they can force us to either buy their headphones or their dongles. Fuck the current gen phone companies.
Abdul Rehman	Everyone is praising the 1+6t but they dont remember that the essential phone has been doing the one eyed notch since 2017
Sokratis Fotkatzikis	The 3 finger screenshot existed on Xiaomi devices for years

Elliott Moncayo	"I'm in my house in Canada", we've seen your "studio tour" videos...
Clifton Carnes	Switched to the 5T After using a Samsun J7 for 4 years. Felt really nice to have that upgrade.  Don't think I'll be needing an upgrade soon, and when I do..I'll want a note 9 literally for the stylus so I can draw on the go.

insdeck2deck	He is not touching himself in this video. Nice. 1+ like for that!
Mark Morris	Now we're heading in the right direction, almost, almost tempted to upgrade my OP5. The 6T is ticking lots of boxes, the price where it should be, not $1k extra, finger print reader under the glass and not on the back (useless if the phone is on a surface), barely noticeable notch, killer spec and storage, and Oxygen OS, aside from a few small quarks, is the next best thing to stock. If the notch can disappear on the 7 or 7T you've got me.

≈†tƒõp√°n Zoubek	I am still running my oneplus 5 and frankly I don't see myself upgrading for some time, and the way things are going it possibly won't even be oneplus device. I like not having notch and I really like my headphone jack. Will probably have to go fro Samsung or LG next time I am buying new phone. :/
Richard Smith	Vote with your dollar. Simply avoid phones without a headphone jack. If they lose money, they will put them back.  PS: Fuck you apple.
AaaMiPixulaAa	He cant believe it
Daan de Wilde	NO HEADPHONE JACK? ONE PLUS 6 Ls ... if u ask me
Aisaaax	Idea for TechQuickie: Why phone manufacturers don't use transparent Aluminum instead of Glass. I mean, yeah, it's more expensive, but you'd think some premium model would have it by now. The upside is - it's extremely hard to scratch or break. It's aluminum.

Maimela Maponya	teardrop notch, i guess companies are starting to remember the essential phone in a way. RIP to Essential phone you gave up to quickly
Nicholas Lalhmingmawia ralte	unbiased
SilencerNate	I rarely upgrade my phones.  I have a BlackBerry Passport SE, which is my primary and trusted phone, and a OnePlus3 as my secondary.  I had no interest in upgrading the 3, but with that much packed into that tiny cost, I am going to seriously have to reconsider.
Maan Alaulaqi	R.I.P Notification Light.

Qasz	No IPX 68, no watching LTT in bath, no buy.
Ali Abdallah	No 3.5 jack=not being
Mark Richards	Are we just gonna ignore the fact that he called the included case a condom?
3GenGames	As someone watching this on a 1+6, this phone was worth the carrier switch and what not. But I'll never settle without a headphone jack. I haven't even used the free wireless ones I got with my 6 because I don't wanna charge them. Also won't be bothered to carry an adapter. You forgot your audience, 1+. You will not see me buying a new phone from you after my 6 dies.
Schnurtelefon	bathrobe
darrennorniron	I recently moved from S7 edge to S9 plus, the only downgrade? The fingerprint scanner on the S7 was much better because it was on the home button - which I also still kinda miss
Jonny Pi	So disappointed, no headphone jack. At least they include a dongle.
Savak	"condom like case"
Xianhong Meng	Guess manufacturer don‚Äôt get it. Apple had the balls to remove the headphone jack because they had AirPod with w1 chip, what do you Androids have, huh?
BadKarma 714	Austin did this video and uploaded it on the same the same day i rather watch linus take i love going to austins channel and say linus alrady did this video lol

Shahar Rosner	No headphone jack, no money in the bank!
TheFinnishYankee Singleton	When you aren't allowed to care because you're on Verizon and OnePlus phones don't work on CDMA networks.
Erik Thiart	Is it just me or is Linus's eyes darker than my soul in most of the videos lately.
Zee uus	Build a ryzen 3 budget desktop
Golan Klinger	He‚Äôs probably wearing socks and sandals under the covers. Linus rolls his own way.
killerm12	you can buy this...  or you can buy Xiaomi Mi 8 for half the price with all the same features(except for the in-screen fingerprint reader which I prefer to have at the back anyway)
adam log	That phone is massive
Kev	Woah... the price is really good
aaae	Using pentile means you have 33% less ppi than whats written on paper. I had OnePlus 3 for one day and returned it. It looked like shit. Samsung at leasts puts QHD so it actually looks good. People making fun of iPhone XR which has more ppi then op6t (326 vs 302 IRL).

Alex Ehm	60. I can't unhear it now. Thanks, Pelle.
Hendobrine 26	Has anyone else noticed misaligned audio?
DMT Stainless LLC.	I have had a OnePlus since the first one, my OnePlus 6 is Awesome BUT I USE HEADPHONES EVERY DAY. I do not want another piece of stuff to lose when I am charging the phone. Plus I use VOLTA Cables, now those wont work. FU One Plus.
Ghost In Your Screen	Crappy speaker, no headphone jack, no wireless charging, no expendable storage (big internal storage though), no IP68, useless second camera... Pity, because these things matter to me.

HellRaiserQQ	I haven't used a headphone jack on my s8+ for like months.  Bluetooth Razer headphones are amazing for that matter
Joey Keilholz	OnePlus has been getting worse and worse
slicster	My OnePlus 6 is a peice of crap in terms of durability. You showed the rivurous tests they did to the last model as well and let me tell you, their QA is lacking. My phone is scratched everywhere(I can't believe this is gorilla glass), the screen and back cracked twice in my pocket. The screen doesn't always register swipes even before the cracks. The repair process was painful and oneplus support is terrible - taking no responsibility for any of the issues. On top of all that, for the back repair, without any notice or warning, they wiped my device. If it was necessary to wipe the decide, it would have been nice to have been informed. Unimpressed where OnePlus is headed. It's as if my phone was build in another factory! It wouldn't surprise me if the 8gb of ram in my phone is somehow software coded because apps don't even stay opened in the background for more than a few mins. Very suspicious stuff! Back to real flagship for me or maybe try Apple for the first time! The glory days of OnePlus are already over for me... Gosh do I miss my OnePlus 3.
blewyd	When he was talking about dropping the phone I thought he would talk about mass drop
George S	I have been using my bluetooth Skullcandy headphones for a year now.  Cheap and works great, never had that painful accidental pull out you get with corded headphones.  Get off the stupid headphone jack thing.  It's not fair in reviews.

Felipe Kauer	why those idiots just make the fucking headphone work over usb them! stupid dongles!

George Chilufya	seems the only thing trending in the comments is the headphone jack this, the headphone jack that. Personally i dont care about about the jack, and in the near future, headphone jacks will be old news. so get with the program. Oneplus nice phone indeed, cant wait to get it!
batsonelec C	Why does Android OS need 8GB of ram ? Windows 7 runs great on 4, Mac OS 10.11 also great on 4, this is a mobile OS, these should need no more than 2GB for a perfect experience, 1GB should still be perfectly usable. If phones are going to need these specs, might as well run real OS's on them.

Bmo	To be honest, I was actually considering upgrading there then I saw the headphone jack thing...  I guess no more one plus for me..
CrossWood	First World problems.
Shawn Miranda	Sponsored by OnePlus? What happened to not doing sponsored reviews? I still have a lot of faith in LTT so I'd greatly appreciate it if you didn't muddy the waters.
Deinorius	It seems like an awesome phone! But without a headphone jack it's a NoGo. At least this makes my Oneplus 6 even more affordable. Instead of that it's practically a superb evolution. Oneplus doesn't need to revolutionise the market. It's fine just to produce the right product and with a headphone jack it would wonderfully be.
Tommaso Galdi	I won't bow to you, headphone jack removers! >:c
MrCow Productions	Oh yes Dennis please film me without my shirt on
Plasmaboo	*Things to not like:* - no headphone jack - usb 2.0 (slow data transfer rate, sucks because you can't put an SD card in, so if you actually have tens of gigabytes of music/movie to transfer, it's going to be slow) *Things that sucks, but at least they tried to compensate:* - no expendable storage sucks, but 128GB is an acceptable amount and it makes it easier to swallow. - there's still a notch, though to be fair, it's pretty damn small. *Things to like:* - good price - fingerprint reader under the screen, though real-world usability and reliability needs to be proved - good enough specs for any meaningful usage (like just about every smartphone now) *Things that aren't good or bad:* - amoled display: great contrast and blacks at the cost of burn-in issues among others amoled downsides. - average resolution. Less than "2K" (1440p), when phone with 4K (2160p) are a thing. But it's not very useful unless you want to use your phone for some shitty VR experience.  If you don't really use your large storage space, or use it mostly for apps, and you either have expensive bluetooth headphones (or can live with using a dongle) or you don't care about your audio being garbage (like, you're listening to mp3 anyways etc), then the main issues shouldn't be a deal-breaker. A decent option considering the various jokes that many smartphones are nowadays.
Matthias Schmitt	Dear god, people! Just because everyone stops puuting headphone jacks in their phones doesn't make it less stupid and consumer-unfriendly...

Edward Drachenberg Jr.	OnePlus or Pixel 2/3 or... ? Recommendations? camera and pokemon go use, would like to maintain free google photos option like my nexus 5x, just want more speed - Verizon
Sticks And Stones	Will never buy a phone without earphone jack... Just another add on cable to carry/lose in your pocket.
Wiskerftw	Maybe tone down the straight up lies in your sponsored content. The on screen fingerprint scanner is nowhere near fast, you were just unlocking the phone with your face. It's really slow. Also it's a 400mah upgrade, not 500.
hovak101	Watching this on my OnePlus 3T
Simoml Gt	You dont need the audio jack for anything because of the adabter 6T have fast charge and good battery so is that too bad you have to use like 20mins for charging and then you can use audio jack for rest day :v
NH Komaiha	1+60
ALFbeddow	I know it's not coming to America but why is no-one talking about the Mate 20 pro.
Scott2k44	Linus I really think you should take a look at the Mate 20 Pro. The in screen fingerprint sensor is really intuitive and allows you to unlock multiple profiles with different fingers.
Aakash Jhaveri	He's the only one who mentions who sponsored them Love you

Bobar	BRO! They missed the BIGGEST chance ever. It‚Äôs not the OnePlus 6T. It‚Äôs the 1 + 60!! GOTEEEM!!!
mark grant	I don‚Äôt see why removing the 3.5mm jack is still an issue with people. The whole point is that wireless is cool, if it be a sound system or headphones being used. And if you don‚Äôt want wireless then add a $1 dongle, it is not even like you have to carry anything extra just plug it into your headphones and store wired headphones as normal for when needed, if they are needed. Then you have the fact that USB C is a better future standard to be having. In a few years it will all be USB C headphones with a dongle for 3.5mm if needed, then no 3.5mm on laptops. My next headphones will be Audeze Mobius, as well as being pro mastering headphones, I work in video, sound and music production,  they have 3D sound with tracking, then Bluetooth, 3.5mm jack and USB C - future proofed headphones already. People need to get over themselves, this 3.5mm thing isn‚Äôt even an issue, let alone a big issue. And I say that as someone that uses professional wired headphones with sound production for the bulk of the time, maybe I am too familiar with using adapters and dongles in that capacity.
Q Mat	So are sponsored videos green lit by the client before publishing them?
Dennis Dowd	All great features, but if a manufacture doesn't insist in wrapping its phone is glass, then all this isn't even needed.  My phone costs me $75.00 and does everything pretty much as I want it too.  Yeah, it is slower than most, and the screen is the best in the world.  It can only use 2.4ghz and the RAM is limited.  But, I don't have "any" monthly payments trying pay this phone off, and I don't need to have insurance because if this phone breaks, I will simply buy a new one out of pocket.  I believe that this is the future of smartphones. I remember when microwave ovens costs as much as a $1000.00 + when they first came out.  Now you can buy ones under $50.00 dollars.  This will be the future.  Our children will wonder what the hell did you pay so much for a simple smartphone?  Thanks for the video.
Ayush Bakshi	03:29 I was ready for "today's sponsor" üò¢
ll	surprised this guy is so popular, he obviously doesn't have any integrity to be a tech channel and get paid to do positive reviews.
Wouter Verbruggen	Great as if there weren't enough screen aspects ratios on android already *annoyed developer*
Rek Dem	Too expensive and no jack. I guess its going to be samsung

Nicolas Shiaffino	One Plus = the best
Nipun Sathsara	Is it have water resistent feature?
The Stopmotion Makers	Who else got a OnePlus 6T ad before watching the video?
David Corden	Nice: https://youtu.be/NdWJpHt1Xws
Johnathan Norton	One plus 6t is the only phone I'm actually ok with having the no headphone jack. It takes so little time to charge that I'll never be charging and listening to music thru headphones at the same time. If I really need to listen I can plug it in for like 10mins and get music for an hour
Isac Joseph	Dang if this came out before the 8+ , o would have definitely bought this ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Cyber rb25	Would like to see the "negative illusion" (trademark pending) for the top of the screen being indistinguishable from the notch whereas you can see the notification and general icons in there. THAT would be next gen solutions.
Dear.zeshan Ali	Can you give me a computer free?
Brendan Lucero	No headphone jack?     DROPPED
Sandor Dugalin	"Still no water resistance rating..." *closes video*

Erkki Muhonen	where's the threadripper review?:D :D :D
Mikul Gamour	Wow! $549? That's insanely cheap compared to most flagships these days! That's pretty much competing with the Pocophone F1 in terms of $$ to phone ratio.
Raymond Gonzalez	No üëªüêùüêù are NICE

Freibuis	Nope. Still can't charge and use real no latency better quality headphones at the same time.

Jeremy Mann	Ah, so Linus IS in bed with One+
Easy Bitch	But yeah, optical fingerprint scanner is not the best, Samsung galaxy s10 will have an ultrasonic and no notch at all.
Kacper Skornicki	OnePlus feature - notch OneLess feature - headphones jaxk
J4NZK1	Linus, are you going to check out Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?  Pretty please :)
anon	Sponsored by OnePlus, not even going to watch the video, nobody would watch a review of an Apple, Samsung or Google phone sponsored by then so why would they watch one sponsored by a smaller company.
Maurice LesGrosYeux	Linus is so biased that‚Äôs boring.  That‚Äôs will cause his fall. Seriously, leave Apple out of the conversation. Apple almost another market. They have their own ecosystem and demographic. I was here to learn about the 6T but the anti-Apple pun, and the Hugh Hefner‚Äôs robe was boring.  Unsubscribe today, it became boring.  Marques is more pro, Lew more technical, and  front page tech more objective and funny.

Jimbles Leedle	Besides the lack of sd card expansion, I'm really attracted to the 6t.  That said, I lost my boner when I saw the dongle.
Bob Tee	why are you wearing eye liner?... have you moved to san Francisco or are you copying 'eyebrows' trudeau?
Shorne Pubique	Headphone Jack ? ahhh i'll keep looking.
andrew nelson	Apparently robes are called house coats in Canada
Bazsik	MI MIX 3! LOOK AT MI MIX 3! I just CANNOT make up my mind which to get! 6t or mix 3???!
TheHermit	I like it, despite the fact that they removed the headphone jack. At least they didn't go all crazy with the pricing and still managed to keep it reasonable... unlike some pretentious manufacturers
Faizal Stormtrooper	Nice for my birthday
alex air	kinda of glaring at my s9 now...
Classified	I was thinking about microLED and possibilities it'll bring to the table when it will be introduced - I think that the camera lens can be created in the way that it will focus the image from between the pixels OR the sensor may be distributed under the panel (between pixels). So we will have really complex lens with many "covering" points and single sensor, or many small sensors with many lenses in between pixels which will be composing larger image.  Of course to eliminate light bleeding - part of the pixels, under which the camera will be located, will be turned off when the camera will be in use. It seems really hard to manufacture, but I think it may be Idea worth spreading. I managed to create some drawings on smaller scale - with 3x3 pixels. I'm also going to create some large scale models. I hope some company will see this comment and introduce the idea, because I'll never be capable of  forcing my idea anywhere - Poland isn't exactly the land of opportunities ;__;
faivdolla	I just wish they would now make a "normal" sized phone, something like 4-4,6inch range would be awesome. Funny thing is, after looking around, there is no info or any news that someone is doing it, only focus is bigger and more cameras... oneplus mini would be great
Mnpn	This is a very nice phone, well done to OnePlus! Coming from an iPhone X user.
Achim Villones	Why do they have to copy crApple?
Patrick Joesph Fallon	So, apart from Gorilla glass 6 and a larger battery there is no reason to upgrade from my OnePlus 5t. Besides the Battery  is steller already on the 5t already and with dash charging your battery is basically full after 30 mins. Gesture thing is already implemented on the 5t. Changing location of fingerprint scanner, pointless, I like it on the back but these preference, and unlocking speed of it seems slower, whats the point of that animation? And no 3.5mm audio jack is a real negitive for me, A. Because can't charge the phone and use headphones at the same time and B. Wireless headphones are another thing you have to charge and I know if I got them I'd lose one or both of them.   So I don't see a reason to upgrade. But definitely a good if not the best option for non OnePlus users currently as the price is most reasonable for the quality of the phone.

brandon bilodeau	please explain why everyone is saying that youtube is dying
sv6m	Really?  Nothing else that is bad about this phone besides the headphone jack? The show itself was very funny (though a bit exaggerated) but it feels like 1+ somehow got "special treatment" without too much criticism...
Maurice H	yeah whatever but can it make phonecalls?
Ansil Hameed	No audio jack? !!.. nop.. nop.. nop..üòë
Callum Mace	Can't say I trust a review sponsored by the company that made the phone smh. What's the point?   Plus this review just further highlights Linus' irritating bias against Apple because when they implement the same features, he hates them. For example the notch. Now I know this is just personal preference, but a triangular notch? That seems way more annoying to me than Apple or Google's one. Maybe just me.   Then again, Apple aren't throwing money his way like 1+ have.
Landon Moody	As a futuristic approach, I do see that the removal of the headphone jack to be beneficial. Imagine wireless earbuds becoming smaller and as cheap as 10$. Then it really makes sense. But right now, I think the removal is wayyy to early as wireless earbuds and headphones are not abundant and too expensive
Waseem Aslam	60. Am I the only who found it funny?
Llova1	Mostly stock android is exciting, and I LOVE the under-screen fingerprint reader, but:  What about updates? How long do they promise to support the device for? He didn‚Äôt mention the camera either, I don‚Äôt want or expect much of it, but it does worry me that image quality was totally ignored.
TheOneNOnlyAxi	GUYS GUYS GUYS IT'S FINALLY VERIZON COMPATIBLE!
Your wise cousin Joe	No

Francesco Romano	Don't add a list of different prices with their storage and RAM options to the review, Linus.

Aurimas B	4:38 üò≠ Not one plus, you were the chosen one.
Everyday Gadgets	No more sponsor plugs in the beginning of the video? Is this a dream?
Crescendo	That no headphone jack is a deal breaker for me. I use it every day and at the time of day I usually use it the most, I'm charging it at the same time. Not really gonna replace my nice headphones with some cheap wireless option (maybe in the future i'll get a nice pair, but not now)... Maybe i'll settle on the 6 instead...
john m	My V20 is still better than all this current generation garbage you promote. No headphone jack, no replacable battery, that's what a call a phone for chumps with more money than sense.

Michael Kantorski	This is not a drill! I repeat: not a drill!  Verizon Compatible!? Holy shit finally! We finally get a great phone  for a reasonable price! And hopefully that brings down prices of other phones now too! The choice of phones on Verizon is abysmal.

Aashish Kapoor	Sorry what 4:13 ?
InvisiMan	I hate these sponsored videos... you're usually unbiased, but this video stinks of sponsor-induced bias. You spent like 5 seconds *joking* about the removal of the headphone jack and a few second justifying the notch. Nobody fucking like these terrible "features" and it will hurt the OnePlus brand. Anyone looking for a new phone should know that these are everyday omissions/oversights that will hurt the user experience for as long as you own the phone.

cgheezey1	the disappointed father bit was the best part
neophoys	Okay right of the bat, it just isn't good practice to have a video sponsored by the company of which you are also reviewing the product. I have no issues with sponsorship per se but this just begs for criticism, no matter if there actually is a bias or not.

Twinlies Blaze	No audio jack!!!!!  DISAPPOINTED !!!!?
Liam Sharif	Couldn't give a toss about the headphone jack anymore it's not needed
Leo Weng	this is literally the same as my current phone oppo r17pro
TheZoonder	No 3.5 mm jack, no sd card slot, no dual sim, weird screen ratio (19.5:9 wtf is that?),  no wireless charging and not even water resistant... The only pro being the underscreen fingerprint sensor. Which will not really be something that special in a month or two. Wow, you really showed us, how is it done, OnePlus...
Richard	Now, I can make millions by making usb-c headphones with a passthrough. Sweet.
Exude	You guys need a new hand model tbh. It enhanced the video watching experience
CyberGenesis	Honestly, i got BT headphones a while ago and really stopped caring about the jack, its the ridiculous hardware for 1/3 the price of another flagship phone that's got me hooked on OnePlus

ViruLe Dalek	Not going to lie, I'm really tempted. I've loved my 5, and the only thing that kept me from upgrading to the 5T or 6 was the fact that they put the fingerprint reader on the back ( and that I'm not an animal who goes through phones once a year). Seeing that the one under the screen is still pretty snappy has my interest. Having no audio jack sucks, but I rarely use mine as it is anyways.

mynameisray	When you're sponsored so you refuse to say bad shit about it. It's like Apple doing the shitter thing and putting a fuckin S sticker on it. Total trash with minor upgrades.

KILLERONROAD	Why can't we just have a freaking headphone jack on our devices? Why is that such a big deal? We want it and it costs like nothing to add.
Dustin Graham	Everyone really loves to bitch about the headphone jack. Almost every single company has removed it so why exactly is this surprising to anyone? Yeah Oneplus did a shit job with those polls, but if  you want a phone with a headphone jack you either need to buy an LG or Samsung phone, or you have to go pretty low budget and compromise on some specs. If you want a reasonably priced flagship spec smartphone with great software, you can't really go anywhere else but the pocco f1,  which has an awful screen.
Papa Thanos	What's this? *No* headphone jack? Well I guess it's trash now.     But seriously, the absence of a head phone jack shouldn't blind you from the posittives, such as the under screen fingerprint sensor and the price range which is lower than the big companys(apple, samsung) just becuase something changed ,doesn't neccesarily make it bad.    Note: sorry for bad grammar

x√∏√±œát	Well... I've been using good wireless headphones for almost 2 years already, so it's not *THAT* painful of a loss, but still disappointing. I'd still like it to have a slightly better battery though. And of course, I'd like to watch a more in-depth review later after Linux has used it for at least two weeks, to hear him discuss actual objective pros and cons.

Akeem Scott	bro why we roasting apple all the time lol but it true with apple 1400 with  new fast charger and 3.5 mm dongle
ImReqularr	I had like *10* OnePlus 6T videos on my feed but I chose *Linus's* !
Jeroen  Van De Bunt	Hey Linus, what do you think about the Xiaomi mi mix 3? And are YouTube making a video about that phone?
DonDark	removing the 3.5mm jack is a silly excuse to sell expensive bluetooth earbuds. nothing els
Abhisek Rout	transparent condom type case... lmao :-P
Disco Puppy	In screen fingerprint scanner: Ok, that's pretty damn cool  Tiny notch that you can still hide away: Even Better, I Might Get This  Pre-applied protector, case and GG6: HOLY SHIT I'M BUYING!  Dongle to use headphones: well, there goes another phone off my upgrade list...
Cesar Leyva	Linus do u smoke the good kush in Canada
FONSTASTIC	I just love how much shade you can throw at Apple on a single video lol
SwissBro1400	Linus !!!?  How about the honor magic 2 ?? This will be a could candidate to the 6t ! Because the magic 2 will have a jack üòå
firepaw74	I absolutelly love my OnePlus 3T. It still recieves android and oxygenOS updates, it doesnt have ugly notch and it still has handphone jack.
Dr3aM	When a phone has more ram than your pc
Akshay Balalee	My sister walked into my room, while I was watching Linus in bed...lol
AMEER SALIM	New meme ? 1:59
BrownMarxist	one plus? more like one minus since we're removing shit like the headphone jack
Jason Hunt	Looks like an excellent option over the Pixels. (EDIT) However after watching Austin's review 1) There is no IP water certification 2) No wireless charging - both not mentioned in this (Linus)  review.
Kommentator	Don't make entire videos about the sponsor's product. Just don't. I don't care if it features an impartial opinion on the device, it just doesn't feel like it.. especially in this particular video (Dude, you sound like the living incarnation of the 6T's specsheet ffs!). This defeats the entire purpose of watching a review in the first place!
Florian Maislinger	05:37 nice boner ;)
HoldCaptiveForDeath	Would have preferd if this video wasnt sponsored. Mostly said the positive
ninjafan69 shagger	But can it watch porn in 4k?
Brock Obama	No headphone jack, wireless charging, MicroSD, or official IP (waterproof rating)? No buy. Never settle by the way!
vilkku	why is screen to body ratio so big deal? I'd much rather have hardware buttons at the bottom(like my s4 active) so I don't accidentally press them while watching videos. Also the notch just looks dumb and the extra screen space doesn't really matter because it will just be blocking content that would be there.
Gordon Freeman	OHHHHHHH!!!! YEAHH. LOL. That disappointed  parents  bit was epic. Well done. 7 second lawl.
PhazonBlaxor	About disabling the notch: "So much of the notification bar is preserved, that I cannot recommend doing that anymore" What? Have you even tried "disabling" the notch before? Notifications still stay up there even if you disable it, so the only thing the smaller notch does is to give you more space for notifications. Wtf are you talking about Linus?  No matter if you disable it or not, you are basically left with the exact same amount of screen real estate, because the notification bar takes up that space anyways. Same is true for Oneplus 6.  Recently the things you have said haven't made much sense Linus. Like when you complained about rounded corners on iPhone wasting space, but didn't complain about the bezels wasting space on Note 9. Instead it is - according to you - a no compromise device somehow.
Anas Patel	A condom type case lmao
Nick Bundy	I will never buy a phone without a headphone jack as long as I am able to.
Patryk Matusiewicz	$600 gets you a lot of phone here, would buy if I didn't have pixel.
Jeremiah Freeman	Anybody remember when they (and others) were pushing flagship speed phones for like $350? Anyone? No? Just me?
prodhrider	i hope they get fucking burned for not including the headphone jack.
Geoff N	Er. I can't watch the video because it's paid content???
DaSpood	OnePlus 6T on day 1, but still no Huawei Mate 20 Pro coverage after two weeks of its announcement :(
Piotr Niewczas	Good old boye Jack is essential
Briant Cosby	Total dishonest
Martin Tausen	Nice.
Md Yusuf Ansari	it's look like every tech channel just want to embarss iphones
TheMegahiiva	Can't listen music in my car with that piece of shit. (Without strugling with stupid dongles)  I was going to buy it... not anymore..
JeiCorsair	My OnePlus 3T is still running great. Nothing here that makes me feel I need to upgrade.
Matthew Winterbottom	After watching this video I think I'm sold. I was going to upgrade to the pixel 3xl after my pixel 2 is paid off. But seeing all this on the 1+ and it's still Android and very very affordable. I am sold. I really like it and it might be my next upgrade soon.
Burgundy Burnouts	#HouseCoat
Rafael Antonio Moreno Contreras	How can you accept sponsorship from the thing you are ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù? That makes it just a commercial, not a review...
lipzi	XIAOMI MIX 3!
Jeffrey Morgan	Didn't mention the speaker?
sed8me69	Notice Linus didn't drop the box in bed..? ü§£üòÇ (not soz & yes, had to üòâ)
Wesley Mercer	Always jabbing iPhones tho üò≠üò≠üò≠
M45KY	Just sitting here with my Vivo Next S ... Underscreen fingerprint, 3.5 mm port and no notch.... #humblebrag
nuyou21	Yep, OnePlus‚Äôs notch approach was to just use the $400 Vivo V11 Pro and called it a 6T for dummies. But thats OK as both companies are owned by BBK electronics. I‚Äôm not angry, I‚Äôm just disappointed as so much for Never Settle! ü§•üìµü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíØ
Mark Sadhra	One plus owner. No jack no care. Hellow LG G7 ONE.
Robert Zamarron	Just buy wireless headphones lol
afx	98% of you wont even buy that phone so why whine
MightyBoot	Looks like my interest in the 1+ 6T was lost with the lack of a headphone jack. There's nothing wrong with my High quality headphones and i'm not going to abandon them for this trend. which is a shame, because the rest of the phone looks fantastic.
markuskiner	Linus Sebastian ... less phone reviews and more tech news please!!! Phones are boring.
bullseye	Beautiful phone with a little pimple.
arawtgabi	What?  No headphone jack!  No sale!  Wait I don't use the headphone jack.  Yey One Plus 6T!
Jyo	I would still buy oneplus 6 instead of 6t , fuck you oneplus
Louis ‡¨†‡¨ø‡¨Å	Rip new intro
Casper D√ÜHLI	"Condom case"
hundio88	Any phone with a notch small or big no headphone jack and expandable storage its a no deal sorry oneplus.
username	meizu 16th has the same fingerprint sensor
empCarnage	Dad Linus lol!
Sergiu Sprintar	hey linus, cia was able to do "in-screen" cameras for years, as well as "in-screen" audio listeners. It 2019-2020, it should come to consumers as well ;) just a bit more. ps, we are also designing car interiors to work as "speakers" to amplify sound and reduce the amount of actual speakers needed (meaning less material cost and less weight)
Ahmed Abdalla	No headphone jack and you were supposed to be the chosen one!
Hamza Alsharjabi	you remind me of McAfee with that robe hhh
Uncharted Unspoken	Please can we have MI Mix 3. It has been phenomenal considering the design, price and the flagship grade.
Simon K.	Man i miss their old business model. Good quality phones for a budget that could compete with the 2nd newest gen. No advertising, no fucking 500-600 euro price tag, no gigantic sweat shops just good hardware at a good price. These days they have become another greedy manufacturer that would rather release a new phone every 6 months for insane prices instead of taking their time. Who are they even appealing to any more? Too expensive for people on a budget, too weak for people that want high end technology and too popular for hipsters. It's really sad what happened to this amazing alternative to most manufacturers.
Albert Ellison	I'm amazed none has tried the blindingly obvious design of having a notch in the top corners of the screen, so that it doesn't obstruct wide aspect ratio films.... It's be far better for icon distribution and spacing for a far less intrusive feel.  I'll whip up some renders on my channel of my idea if anyone is interested of how this might look.
Ahmad Husaini	Galaxy S10 will be lit! üî•
Nikolei Graham	The I am not angry, I am just disappointed dad part was hilarious. I stopped the video just to like. :)
Luka ≈†auperl	That phone is not the only thing that's hard down there...

Lemon	Is there any actual issues with 3.5mm dongles? I just got a pixel 3 xl and I use wired headphones(M40x's) and I have no issues with the dongle. Especially being included in the box.
P√°l Kis	You can pry my wired headphones from my cold dead hands! I was in love with the oneplus 3, but my next one is gonna be the zenfone 5z. Also fuck you oneplus, I really wanted to buy the 6T
Dim TS7	Imagine what Linus would have said If one plus didn't sponsor this video...
enchantrand-esque	Lmao I love Linus
TheDigitaldumpGamer	Not ever buying a Oneplus again until they put the headphone jack back in. Now I am just going to save up for when the time comes for a new phone and get a samsung (maybe note) and hopefully they still have a headphone jack
Kamudala	Apple: Hey new budget phone No fast charger going for 750 OnePlus: Hold my beer.....gives us 6T with more ram oled display and fast charger for 550
Greg Deocampo	condom type
kingbane2	so does the 6t not have a headphone jack?
The Hated One	Notchn't
Darshan k	( not ' ch ' )üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Paolo Castro	Do Mi Mix 3 next !
‚Å∞ ¬π ·¥ø ·¥± ·¥∫ ·¥∞ ·¥± ·¥ø ·¥µ ·¥∫ ·¥≥ ‚ÇÄ ‚ÇÅ	Dave Lee beats it first
BigRedRugby	Actually, tho whats that french press, I like it
James Mutombo	It seems that the OnePlus 6 is a better phone
Also Unknown As Alexander	Adding this video to my favorites so I can find it back when I have enough saved for a phone, really considering buying it, would like to see more camera details in the video but that just me, although I know Linus likes a good camera on a phone as well, I mean after all they exist so if you buy an expensive phone to me it would be weird to take one with a camera that might had been the best if it was released 5-10 years ago.
TheVfxMakers	I liked the OnePlus 6T. But the fucking HOUSE COAT GOT ME HYPED!!!! WE WANT HOUSE COAT!!
OliQCPRO RotMG	*NICE*
ParagonTheGamer	Really wish i had an obi-wan profile  pic to just say "you were the chosen one"
don't follow me	Daddy Linus is hot man.. Especially in those vintage glasses t
Akzork	I hate display notch
Darius B	Anyone notice he said nothing about the camera?
Hippotosuke	The fact that people think companies remove the headphone jack to copy Apple, even after they've launched campaigns making fun of them is ridiculous. There's advantages and disadvantages to removing the headphone jack, and right now it's a bigger advantage to most people than it is a disadvantage.
SGT Dornan	wtf video reqiers payment to watch
Luke Kingdon	3:25 Oh yes Linus, we know
xCamz _	Trade in my iPhone X for this maybe??
Ishan Jain	Watching this on my oneplus 6. Even though the 6t is amazing, I won't be upgrading. I love my op6.
Ahmed Bouhraoua	I love your channel linus
Lindh	What about the camera :o? Ive had OnePlus 3 and currently use a 5t. Im sooooooo dissepointed in the camera quality compared to other phones.
Antonio Cruz	So does it have wireless charging ?
NewToThisChannel	The 6T looks sick! And getting an actual review on event launch is really nice!
samtherat6	You can easily get a S9 for the same price, and without giving up the headphone jack. Calling it a budget phone is naive at this point.
Aktazf	Calm tf down about the headphone jack
RetroHunter 187	Heck yeah i dont even use wired headphones anymore
bruin98	You put a glass back on your phone and fail to add wireless charging. You don‚Äôt improve the battery you don‚Äôt add water resistance, you added an under the screen fingerprint unlock which to me still needs to be determined by a wider audience for its usability and you removed the head phone jack.  I owned an OnePlus 5t and I enjoyed the experience but this year I bought the iPhone Xs Max going back to iOS after 3 years and honestly I‚Äôve missed the support apps have on iOS. This year is a failure for stock android devices.
Adip Krishna Sikdar	Bathrobe's nice....
Abdul Hadi	what is the background music, sounds great
Mehebub Alam	4:14
d schminke	I'm probably gonna get this over a pixel 3.

rex clone	hey guys, how can I contact you?
Man of Hokuto	Linus stop being a sellout
Andrew Bong	i saw you in the ny launch event. wheres that video
Justible	What is the song playing in background during the actual meat of the video?
MierenMans	the new one plus 60
Josh Hardin	I'm not a hater, and it looks like OnePlus is really trying... the moment I found a fingerprint sensor in the middle of the back side on my nexus 6p i fell in love. i find that an extremely ergonomic placement.  I understand why some may want a front fingerprint sensor (so you don't have to pick it up off the table to use it, and i could see that being a big thing if you've got a qi charging dock like me), but I really don't understand why all the flagship phone manufacturers want to absolutely murder dead the top phone bezel... I really never had much of a problem having a little bezel at the top and bottom of my phone in order to accommodate very important things like the front facing camera, the ambient light sensor, color temp sensor, and most importantly to me, the top and bottom speakers for stereo front firing speakers (i loved that in the nexus 6 and 6p and others, and wish that more manufacturers would do that going forward but i can't find ONE in this generation that does and i'm sad about it), what's more, I'm not a fan AT ALL of the way that the last generation of android phones curved all the corners on the display removing active pixels... I understand this is an aesthetic feature, but really this makes small things in the extreme corners incredibly difficult to view and interact with needlessly... For example if i were using my phone for remote desktop I sometimes have difficulty hitting the close window button on maximized windows when they are zoomed out...  i have but a few pixels i can touch and most of them are gone from the corners now.  this bugs me to no end and I don't see a reason for it... even if they wanted to do this, I would suggest doing it in software and allowing us users who don't like to to undo it in the settings... as I understand it, they just put a matte overlay on the display and hid the pixels from view... it's a small thing to rage about it, but I can't find a phone this generation that doesn't have the stupid rounded corners. - don't get me wrong, I'm all about options, different people are going to to have different preferences about stuff, and I'm really glad that there are a bunch of choices from a bunch of manufacturers to choose from, but they are all making the SAME STUPID CHANGES! (notch, lack of headphone jack, rounded display corners, lack of front stereo speakers)... honestly if they were to take the nexus 6p's shell design and display, remove the logic board, and replace it with something that had a snapdragon 845, a bit more ram, qi charging capabilities, and the camera from the pixel 2 xl, maybe making it more waterproof somehow, I would buy it in an instant!
kees N1	I would buy this, but no headphone jack is a deal breaker
David	I'm still going to buy Samsung or Nokia. Not a fan of Chinese brands...
Fabio Rigo	A pity.. looks good but not jack means no purchase for me.. sorry..
Shahed Kowshik	OnePlus 60???
lunatic911010	I'd like to have 2 finger print sensors on the device. One on the back one on the front.

ace23 nyan	No headphone jack i can deal with it, but no sd card slot thats a deal braker.
Stanley Corr	This actually isn't shit. Well done to OnePlus for making a flagship device that's not worse than the last gen.
MATHPC 40	Next trend: *Remove the charging port*  Apple: *Nice idea!........oh wait what have we done...*
Karl A	Excellent video! Touched on the important points, carefully worded, bravo! (what's up with the chroma noise in the video though? Controlled lighting, filmed on a RED? Shouldn't be an issue? It's just a bit distracting...)
Zsombor S√°ndor	LINUS!!!!!!!! Shave your fukin armpit, 'dollar shave club'..
Ethan Martin	Did anyone else get a "this video requires payment to watch" error at first?
eagle gamer	Don't touch that phone with the hand you jerked of last night
Abed Schama	next step: removing camera
Pawer8	PPL IS NOT OK TO NOT HAVE A JACK. DO NOT BUY PHONES WITHOUT A JACK otherwise in a few years no phone will have a jack
Santosi	2.16666666667  like if you know what i mean
BlackSword FIFTY5	yeah i know 'apple users' you would dislike this video cause its apple get rekt moment guys!! and guys IPhone XS sucks and it also does'nt have a headphone jack so its pay less get more in 1+ 6T they cant put a headphone jack in it because of the screen so please remember it is more on the budget side
Off-Grid Optimist	uhg!! Missed opportunity, if the fingerprint sensor is now behind the screen why is it still in that same terrible position at the bottom. They should definitely have moved that up to a more freakonomic one handed placement such as the center where my thumb can actually reach without dropping my phone!
Psych0technic	That notch looks like a nipple.
Itay Lankri	Nice OnePlus Nice OnePlus

Julian Lemmerich	Man, your videos get better every time. It's amazing. You even manage to make every phone review a bit different.
Ghanashyam S	Thermals???!
Dub Monster	Sponsored by furry pillows
AdobeMan	honestly tho... I was so ready to look into this phone further it looks great, the price isn't silly but once again companies show amazing ignorance to what consumers need and are willing to do on a daily basis and carrying around an extra length of cable just to listen to music? yeah no. just put a 3.5mm jack and you would have made money off me ya big dummies.
WHITE BOY1	I have the one plus 5t at 8gb of ram, my phone has super fast face unlock and no notch my phone also can use wired earphones üòÇ I'm happy I never upgraded nor will I ever üòÇ
ron shhi	549 dont buy  wen all buy phone on 300 all price go we need fight together
Keaggan	Wow that is really impressive....for less than $600?
SIME	TBH, my next phone is going to be a Note. I want the headphonejack and the sd card reader. The missing headphonejack is enough of a deal breaker for me to just go ahead and buy something else for twice the price when my 5T starts to die.
BanhBaoLP	When is the Pixel 3 review coming?
Cloudy	OnePlus have removed the 3.5mm jack, it's a sad day for me, as you said linus, he was supposed to be the chosen one.
DisabledStan	Huawei Mate 20 pro.... jump on it!
Shawn Jorge	An audio jack is not just for headphones but can be used to connect many other devices like amplifiers, active powered speakers etc which still don't have Bluetooth, it's very convenient and u don't have to waste time to sit n pair with Bluetooth.
Roberto Vigil	Oh my god, remove that coffee from the french press!
Tom√°≈° Trbola	Whats with the sound? Sounds like you are talking through the pillow. Nice video otherwise..
Computer	I have a Pixel 2 XL, looking to upgrade. Last two phones were the Pixel XL and the Nexus 6P before that. Loved every phone so far, and each one has felt like an improvement from the last.  Not sure if I should get the Pixel 3
blastedstorm	I thought you said you don‚Äôt do sponsored reviews?
pcfreak1992	The dongle is not a solution.. What if I want to charge my phone and use my wired headphones? If they shipped a dongle that can do both, this might be an option but like this I'm not impressed..

xorinzor	Are we gonna get a video on the camera quality? especially low light / night pictures is what I'm wondering about (hopefully Nightscape really improves things)
Eric C√¥t√©	Which is why I don't like Canuck providers, they don't supply OnePlus devices. (Besides the fact that they're some of the biggest rip off artists ever)
Forever Young	Im happy Oneplus 1, Oneplues 2, oneplus 3T, and Oneplus 5T user. No headphone jack in 6T? Have to change phone next time... It was fun as long as it last. :)
Some Guy	This phone sounds amazing! But the display is most important to me so I'll wait for the Samsung Galaxy S10
Mauro Labate	Fingerprint sensor below the screen is the killer feature for me. I‚Äôm so annoyed by Face ID, despite the major improvements unlocking with my face is still terribly inconvenient compared to fingerprint
xVivio	Was going to buy it, then saw it doesn't have a headphone jack. Not buying anymore, dongles are annoying to deal with
Divanshu Gulati	Poco F1,  the oneplus killer has  suddenly disappeared.

TechHeaven	condom type case ??????
Caleb Baker	I'm sorry OnePlus. But our relationship is over. You have so many promising features, and your notch is the best in the biz, but I won't stand for the missing headphone jack. Farewell, go die in a hole.
Reinhard von Lohengramm	7 minute video to talk about bunch of gimmicks nobody cares about.
Chrissi Reusch	Do they have a patent on this fingerprint Scanner?
Yash devgaria	Did he just say condom type case?

Linux Tuxfriend	They should have built the Cirrus Logic DAC into the adapter instead of making it only available for the 20-bucks thingy.
Joshua	How manufacturers, let alone end users,   could enjoy the lack of a headphone jack is beyond me.
Jose Gandara	One plus I'm in
Hulk-Smash	Linus let's party in.nyc tonight!!!
Best Experiments	Amazing is 6t just cool phone
Prasad Surve	I am in market to buy a new phone. But since this doesnt have 3.5 mm headphone jack, I am not buying this one. Probably the Meizu 16.
Andrew Delashaw	You guys forgot to clean up after last night's fun. I could see the rubber fist you left on the nightstand behind you.
Ben Willock	6T looks so dated compared to the Mi Mix 3.
Tornike Chachanidze	are yah gayyyyyyyyyyy
Rohit Ghali	No headphone jack? Not buying. Take a stand against the industry. Vivo had put a motor and a huge camera in there with moving parts. Get some inspiration. Lack of space is a lame excuse.
manish mehra	Awesome oneplus
Maxime Bakleh	So OnePlus 6T is 61 right? What did I won?
Hope for All	Paid review
Matthias Hei√ü	My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
Sanidhya Agrawal	No head phone jack... Not expected this from one plus.
Rishabh Jain	All those who are missing 3.5 mm Jack - believe me once u strt using Bluetooth earphones u vl hate the jack ...plus we get bigger battery at its cost..i m fine with Bluetooth earphones and i know everyone would go wireless a year down the line..Stop sulking!!
Kari Greyd	Put the dam screen under the cameras on front it will what, take up like, 1 mm.
Nano Mine	Wtf is condom type case? What does it even mean?
Maxim Kruglov	I get why people are upset about the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack, but personally I've been using a bluetooth headset since 2013 and this general trend is fine with me. *shrugs*
wikudo	When you start using a bluetooth headphone, you just can't stop it. I'm giving up my tfz balance 2m with 1more ibfree for the sake of "wirelessly" thing üòÇ

Ch Chand Tanha	Condom type case . Hahah so funny.
Archie Burke	I love headphones
Ludvig Nygaard	Honestly I dislike the tiny notches more than the slightly bigger ones..  Also really dislike the removal of the 3.5mm jack
rmccann11	Anyone know if this will work on Sprint in the US?  I know the OnePlus 6 doesn't but I read that the 6T is coming to t-mobile so I thought 'maybe,' or with if the merger goes though that it might also.
frankmoolah	Seems they caught the Apple bug
Iain Malone	Was that a reference to the Fast Show - Jazz Club at 1:59 ???
Niki	Lol all these boys triggered because of the headphone jack, meanwhile you nearly can't find a flagship phone WITH a jack. Also, I thought the same at first and then a friend of mine let me try his bullets wireless, and I have to say, I'm never going to use wired earpods again, ever. You're probably getting triggered every time you take out your tangled pods out of your pocket and struggle a good 15 seconds to get them untangled, meanwhile bullets wireless is put around neck and play. If you want to play music with the crappy wires just use the usbc to 3.5 adapter, it's not a big deal. You can also just buy the bullets wireless to make your life 10x easier and your music listening experience even better. You are still getting a really good phone for the price so stop crying my dudes, there are worse things in life than losing a headphone jack (Like losing your mom to cancer). WW3 is going to happen soon anyways with our boy Trump and the fat rocket dude so worry about that instead. I'm out, going to play some more red dead 2
milica savic	Thank you Linus very cool
ImmortalDuke	I would fap but i need a mix of some threesome.
FinnishArmy	I don't care that there's no headphone jack, I very very rarely use headphones for my phone. And the times I do is on the plane or a car ride, why are people so mad about using an adapter?
darktrain	i liked the video...kinda disliked the oversized dressing gown...
Danny Rice	Not one mention of the cameras, are they new, the same, or existing at all? Also who wrote Linus' script for the errors in the video to happen? Other than that great phone- I need wireless cans tho.
Abdullah Aftab	Oneplus is awesome man üëç just waiting for the mobile test against iPhone

ThrobbinHood	1:08 - And by "hotly anticipated"  he means "Creepy, unwanted, and Orwellian as FUCK"
Nuggetttss	Why is the 3.5mm jack so important to some people? I hate being tethered to my phone with 3.5mm headphones. That cord is always in the way and catching on stuff.
Leadneck	Yes please LTT house coat! The fluffier the better!
MrGladiator00	I love you Linus! I was so happy when I so this video.
Jonathan Sporrong	I'm really glad that this company exists to slay the top tier phones. I mean honestly, they've come so far from their very first phone. I remember looking at the OnePlus and thinking it'd never see more than a second iteration. But the 6T honestly, and this is just my opinion, seems a more compelling buy than the Pixel phone! Now thats definitely because of my disappointment in the pixel launch, but also how baller this phone is for the price. Good on ya OnePlus (don't care about headphone Jack, bought Jaybirds and can't be happier)
Ra's al Ghul	DID camera guy forgot how to use ISO ?????????? Damn 64k or something
Amir Bright	OnePlus are moving backwards, instead of sticking to the most important (cheap and powerful) they are mocking  Apple then copying (making a bad copy obviously, only Apple can make iPhones).
Shantanu Deshmukh	*condom case* That's new
Hazy216	You had me at under the screen finger print scanner.  You lost me as soon as I saw the dumb notch T_T Edit: and no audio jack T_T
Kiril Shahamov	the notchn't
Hugsy Malone	That's a nice phone, of I was in the market it would probably the one to go for.... But ultimately I will wait for this notch fad to blow over
Walker34	Did i hear condom type case? üòÇüòÇ
Car Toffeln	Since when are hardware back/menu buttons RIP? I've tried OSD buttons and I hate them. I'd rather have .4% less screen-to-body ratio with hardware buttons instead of an all-screen phone. Also no 3.5mm jack... I'll stick with the OP3 thanks.
Avishek Chandra	Disliked coz u went too far with oxygen OS. I mean dude r u high or what? Do u Oxygen is that better? When Stock android is there in the market.
just a guy	check mi mix 3
SeanHeaney	Notchn‚Äôt
Alovon	Wow, adjusting to Bluetooth (Pixel 2XL user here) really makes the removal of Headphone Jacks in other devices you are interested in, kinda more of a "I already have a headset though" situation.
maxpower700	So... Its a p20 pro with a different notch?
SmileOverlord	the 6T is a downgrade in many aspects compared to the 6, the only upgrade IMO is the battery.   thank you for telling us that the 6T won't have a headphone jack, bought my 6 3 weeks ago and right now i'm even happier about the purchase.   shame on you OnePlus.
MammothBehemoth	Finally found out how my phone has been doing accidental screenshots
JohnBoyGamer1	Rip headphone jack. I'll pass
CHRONOS XIII	Linus getting personal with the 6Tüòè

Mr Turbo	what time of the day are you waking up? 3pm?
TR1CKST3R 2OP	We have a better phone with completely no notch and no mechanical shit instead fucking magnetic MI MIX 3 but it's xiomi so fuck the phone
Half Star Films	It's a downgrade. No headphone jack no microSD card!?! Put it in the trash.
Yohenny Sabrina Castro	nice clothes!!DXD
Lara Ava	The bananas never age.... that not even a real house.... are you even naked under that robe??   Idk what truth is anymore.

5KYM0L3CUL3	I have a semi
Nicholas C	Having a company sponsor a video in which you're suppose to be giving an unbiased opinion about is gross. That does seem to be an increasing trend with Chinese phone manufacturers and the Youtube tech community. Guys need to cut it out, even if you're disclosing it.
Dx Mx	Removed headphone jack, added stupid notch, and makes an already ridiculous aspect ratio worse... Voting No with my wallet.
NoHackJusteGirl	Nice boobs
Dennis Jassmann	Well ima get an S9+ then. Costs only a bit more now anyways...
ahcene chetouane	Kudos for the nice pun on the intro I loved it

Mark James	As much as I like OnePlus. A notch and no headphone socket. No thanks.
Serius Sim	I thought I would never see Linus naked in bed gesturing a heart at me, but it happened. I feel complete.
jimmyf1312	Linus shill tips- I wonder what he‚Äôd say about the iPhone if Apple sponsored one of his videos
Umut Entropie	You always have to say something against the iPhone...Can¬¥t you just review the 6T in a more proper way?
Shekhar Kumar Yadav	Head phone jack crybabies incoming !!!

JoyTheGeek	I love the disappointment scene
Ven Atta	looks like a cum drop lmao.  No heaphone jack and no SD storage? Copying apple like always lmao
Shubham Patankar	Does Yvonne washes your face before you wake up ?
ph00ny1	No headphone jack and wireless charging... Kinda sad
DPMO	Can't trust a sponsored review.
Josh Lewis	There was nothing wrong with the jack. When you see the headphone jack disappear, that is a sign that the company is getting greedy and pushing their shitty Bluetooth headphones. Fuck that
Marten Wielenga	Me: Okay, let's make my attack surface as small as possible  Tech companies: F*CK YOU!!! You will have to use WiFi, Bluetooth and put everything in the cloud so we can look at your stuff as well!!!!  F*ck security/privacy!!!!
Chad Johnson	Stop with the eyeliner dude...
Faisal Anwar	And the award for the most underwhelming phone of 2018 goes to the OnePlus 6T. $300 more with pretty much the same specs as the Pocophone minus a headphone jack. No IP rating, wireless charging, stereo speakers, QHD display, SD card support or triple camera either. The OnePlus 6T is certainly not worth the money.
blue Ice	Are you going to give away the phone as a prize
aliebn	Headphone jack is outdated, get with the times or use an old phone. Simple as that. You‚Äôre all a bunch of crybabies who can‚Äôt comprehend that technology moves on from what it was to something more advanced and more convenient, of which Bluetooth is both. Who actually wants to hear a wire smacking against their body when they walk? Who wants to deal with tangled cables all the time? Most consumers don‚Äôt, but if you do then stick with an ancient device or a Samsung. If audio quality is that important to you then you wouldn‚Äôt be listening on a phone anyway. Grow up and get a life.
Rishabh Gupta	One Plus, I have one question. If it is about convenience i.e. placing the fingerprint sensor in the front and compromising on the Headphone Jack. Then I do not get how is it more convenient than to carry an additional dongle around. This, This my friends is how you lie to a consumer and this is what a marketing team sat inside a room and discussed one day on how to answer to the consumers question on the removal of the headphone jack.
GRAPFIK I Ly	I ve got bluetooth headphones hahahah i dont need 3.5 mm jack:)  I need this phone!
Deus Krieg	My collection of wired headphones is worth more than this phone. So, no go.
VladiSSius	Thumbnail Linus looks like that "OMG guy" from Troll 2 XD
Luminous	60
PonySlaveStation	1+ wer is me headphone jack!?
Dan	They magically come up with away to integrate the fingerprint scanner under the screen and then compromise on a notch, come on.
Ignacio Camacho	OnePlus is the new Apple: no headphone jack, a notch and no SD card slot. Funny how we went back to Samsung being the market leader, their phones just make a lot of sense
Steve    Fox	No headphone jack means another phone I will refuse to buy, those with a jack are gonna pull people away from what could be a better phone in all other aspects.
Ion Ganciu	hey linus , do review to huawei mate 20 pro please <3
justDefied	That heart though...
Hoody‚ô§	I bet Linus loves whoever wrote this script because he gets to lounge around in a bathrobe through the whole shoot lol

werethless12	Notch....    NOPE!

Loploppl	He said gorilla glass 6 and I immediately left for jerryrigeverythings video
DatTastyBacon	Boo. Fucking. Hoo. No headphone jack.
Laurens	I hope you can disable that fingerprint scanner animation. It doesn't look that good
Muhammad bin burhan	the funny thing is  that people who removed the headphone jack from the phone not doesn't even give headphone jack dongal with their flagship models.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
unlokia	*OH* .... oh dear... they fell into the trap of _"Under screen fingerprint sensors R soooo kool! We got to have one!"_  Golly, how dumb. There is NO way to locate the sensor in a tactile manner, and that is RIDICULOUS. Novelty *clearly* trumps good design sense, as we see.  If you want to spend money on an Android phone, SAVE as much as you can, and buy an Honor 8X or another Huawei. It's not *about* getting a "good" phone - Android doesn't inspire good phones, it has phones which are *good enough* , it's about getting the best of a crappy bunch, whilst not being ASLEEP enough to ever *consider* spending over ¬£400 on *A PHONE* (serious? You're delirious)  You get *NOTHING* extra or "better" from these jumped-up, overpriced shill phones. Let me clarify: the *thought* of purchasing a OnePlus *ANYTHING* has never remotely crossed my mind, but I did once hear some HORSE SHIT from the old CEO, apparently a VERY arrogant man (well, at least at the time) and it put me *RIGHT OFF ANYTHING* they'll ever try and palm off on people.  This "hype" is VERY niche indeed, and as much as they *wish* they were "competing" with everyone else, allow me to say this - I have *A LOT* of friends and family, and only ONE of them has a OnePlus, and ALL of the rest have iPhone.
Swanky Cam	I judge people that dont use bluetooth by now....
Hagfish101	Inb4 everyone starts bitching about the headphone jack  Edit: I‚Äôm too late
JoeRieper	1+ used to be super great and it has changed. It is only great now, as they shot themselves to the leg by removing headphone jack.
Slav boi	No jack = no buy from me
Zipzeolocke	Fun fact, gorilla Glass is manufactured in my home state of Kentucky ^_^
David Johnston	I'm on the same page, I need the unlock sensor on the front not back! Happy days!
Ady Freddy	Bathrobe Linus.. Noice!! üòè No homo, btw
Mats B	I was gonna buy this. Then I saw the dongle
Jooman	Why people care so much that old headphone jack even adapter comes with the phone and bluetooth is better??????
Dylan Harrison	Idk if I would switch from Samsung to one plus but that price is Kings hard to beat given the specs.
demonwares	If I had not gotten the note 9, I might have gotten that phone instead. I just like the Samsung old screen too much and didn't want to wait for 6T.
Daniel M	He got me with the not angry bit lol.
TeamGoldenCompany	Is it just me or is the audioquality really bad in this video? (compared to your normal Videos)
eloj	Actually seem perfect, except for the no 3.5mm jack.
Dude PlayingADude	A "Condom type case" for when it goes wrist deep inside your pockets
Rohith Kumar	a sponsored review?
Mathias	My favourite position for the fingerprint reader is still on the side inside the sleep/wake button. Because that's where I have my thumb when I hold my phone, to me it's the most natural place for it.
The_Keola	Linus... Your coffee is getting cold
xTDAround	Headphone jack? Not really mad either. The trend was bound to catch up...all I want is screen pressure sensitivity so I can sketch with a stylus.  ...which is still no from oneplus.
Nathan White	Anyone who wants a headphone jack has 3 days to buy a OnePlus 6 while supplies last.
Shivam K	notchn't
Zhi Xing Ong	Another headphone jack dies. RIP. Samsung dont let me down.
besweeeet2	Want to settle? Get a OnePlus phone. #NeverSettle
Crazed 357	Im still waiting for that magical phone that doesnt have a front facing camera, front proximity/light sensors, aux, usb ports, just a complete sealed case that I can throw in a river because most likely it would be apple.
Addictive_LiquoriCe	Aux dongle gad dammit. It's going to wear out the charge port üòí And it will not be a firm connection as with 3.5mm directly. Gah idiots! üôÑ
Marc Shields	600.00 for a phone is still insane.
Shohan Anthony Saverimuttu	One plus calls the notch "raindrop" Vivo calls the notch "water drop" notch Google pixel 3 xl  The "mother of all" notchs         "What a notch"  ;-)

talal1316	Bad review
Paul Thongkham	A headphone jack is a must have if it's not broke dont remove it
RyCA	Surprised people are still complaining and surprised there isn't a headphone jack.  It doesn't need to be removed, I agree.  However, it's only a matter of time before it is gone for good from smartphone flagships.
Ks Yeung	I thought u are Deadpool
TheTuxpeng	can't phone manufacturers choose an aspect ratio & stick with it?
Modern Game Network	Linus in a bath robe...  How professional.
TheFourthWinchester	Flagship price but a substandard phone .. No
Scypheroth	ill pass cuz cant finance it through my provider...i cant dish out 1k fo ra phone id rather finance it in my plan over 2 years
Reggan Keggan	When I heard "SPEAKING OF..." I run to see is video already OVERüòÇüòÇüòÇ Oooo its still goes on
HighBridRed	OnePlus 6T = 1 + 60 = 61 Which is an easter egg for them releasing another version soon. The 6T1
wile123456	That skit was nice but should be 10 times longer because the lack of 3.5 audio jack is a deal breaker for many
Matthew Armstrong	Why is there so much discrimination against bezels. I like them lol
Ribotto Studio	RIP headphone jack 2018
Jim Rael	I can't listen and charge at the same time? NOPE. Nothing to see here.

Prashant Gudhe	How is this becoming normal to have one feature, you have to remove the other one...  Stupid practice from apple
Vansh Rai	I have the iPhone 7 rn and will buy the 6t soon! People who say headphone jack is a dealbreaker are retarded honestly lmao it doesn‚Äôt even make a difference to plug in an extra dongle
Magnus Torset	This would've been a no-brainer for me if they didn't remove the headphone jack. Let's hope it's back for the 7.
Avee 9150	Pixel 3xl is way better
Kanista17	would love to see a video about Case airflow visualized by using the 'Schlieren Effect'.
Alexander Saavedra	long term review? I was hoping to get this phone since its coming to Tmobile, but no headphone jack? I think I might stick to my S8+ for now.
TechTro Gaming	tho no headphone jack, for once I'm actually interested
sniperammow	Although getting a high end wireless earbud was the best decision I have ever made, I cannot let kids them. And with no headphone jack, low end head sets will not work ether.
la mere de mathias	Apple: oneplus! Oneplus: what? Apple: oneplus 6t f*cked me with a toothbrush
maxistviews	Not much info on the camera!
DarthHeretic	Glad I got the normal OP6, although I do have a dongle that's actually a DAC/amp for headphones for higher impedance, using the audio jack while the phone is in charge is super convenient.
LightenStar // TurboLighten	LG and Samsung are the 2 Survivors of the Headphone Jack. But Samsung is the only Survivor with no *Notch*
Md.Nazmul Alam Evan	Oneplus 6t is now Linus's oneplus Not sure how his wife gonna feel about that
OtherSideGuy	This phone, has no headphone, Bingo bongo i don't want a dongle
Shane Sahil	Watching on my 6t
Afnan Studio	Ppl arguing abt headphone jack issue basically same as ppl sceptical on changing from floppy disk to cd
Miles Cabrera	Tbh im thinking of watching the OnePlus phones from now on. Def a nice upgrade and lower price than samsung and apple for their latest phones.
WulfeMathias	Forgoing a headphone jack is a deal breaker for me personally. I'd rather have a thicker phone. Typically company's excuses for forgoing the 3.5 is to make the phone thicker
Julio De La Torre	Is ANY hands on not sponsored by oneplus??
Altair Foo	NO headphone jack is OK for me.;)
Zamblot	I'm not a massive fan of under screen fingerprint scanners just because of the way I use my phone (also id much prefer a 3.5mm jack). That being said its a fantastic phone and i do want one so bad, it looks really nice and i am a big fan for the most part lol.  Also does anyone remember those apps that claimed they turned your screen into a fingerprint sensor?
Dhiraj Bhalerao	*DON'T BUY*
4ksandknives	*bow-chicka-bow-wow*
Karl Dahlberg	Not even mad about the 3.5mm jack being taken away. Get with the times
Stavrilaos 10.000 subs without videos	I love i phone haters
Kavin Karunathilaka	Unless you have $1000 Audio Technica headphones you shouldn't be complaining about the headphone jack
killafocker	you bitch fuck, why is this fucker doing phones
Nathaniel Beven	as a 6 owner., the pre applied cover is great (didnt come with, had to buy) because i could never paply it properly (too much of a perfectionist)    that all said, no 3.5mm jack, no buy. its that simple.
Masterpj555	I wouldn't believe a review when you got sponsored by the company. Biased. No headphone jack = no buy
Jonny Dahl.	you're a fairly big production company now, can you please get your audio straight?
TheVergile	no headphone jack = another generation ill skip. also still no sd card.

ascendence	fingerprint sensors never worked for me
Markus Nguyen	2:09 *‚Äùnot‚Äùch*
Igor Noberto	I don‚Äôt see a reasonable reason that prove the 6t is better than the 6. Just the headphone jack is a huge plus, the notch isn‚Äôt bad and the finger print sensor is faster.
John Lee	not headphone jack, no buy
SgtMays	Until a new phone comes out with a headphone jack and as good as the google pixel xl 1, i am keeping it until one comes along that is a good replacement.
crypticpower	No headphone jack no buy and I was going to get it as an upgrade from my oneplus 5 will have to look elsewhere shame
Alexander Freickmann	Yeah, you was the chosen one. But without audio jack, i drop it as obi wan dropped ani into the lava
rickyt1818	no ip water resistant rating. no 3.5mm Jack. Bye bye one plus. going to samsung
SayIDidItTM	So, the OP6t or to wait for the Galaxy S10?
Justin Slayton	Looks nice.  I have to say LTT seem to have really amped up there production quality in recent videos.  Music is a little loud in some parts but overall I don't know what you have changed but I'm liking it.
Pixel_Vengeur	I don't mind the headphone jack disapprearing. What I DO mind is that to one has given me another option. Just put a second USB-C port on the bottom! Give me the dongle all you want, but give me another option. Also, the fingerprint looks sick, but there is no real reason to upgrade from a Oneplus 6. The CEO stated ealrier this year that they would "only release a new phone if there is a big enough innovation that would justify it". They moved the fingerprint scanner on the front, which apparently is the main selling point of the device, same cameras, same processor, same RAM, a storage upgrade (nice bonus, although I don't understand how you can fill up more than 64 Gb of storage), and a slightly bigger battery. Minus a headphone jack. I fail to see the "big improvement" they were talking about.
kingssman2	When servicing phones and taking them apart, I question why we still need that 3.5mm jack.
riley dalisa	I phone Xs does give you headphones tho
rubikfan1	i am still enjoying my lenovo p2. 5000mah baby! and oled
Glyochi	3:30 when i heard "speaking of", i thought the video was over üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Pienimusta	Zero fucks given about missing 3.5mm jack. Missing a IP67/68 rating is worse.
Spaghetti Monster	Your dad is gonna be pi$$ed when he wakes up only to find his bathrobe and his reading glasses are missing. Seriously lol you spent all that money and time building the set but you couldnt spring for a smaller robe so you didnt look like a little kid in a grown-up's bathrobe? lol
Pusky	3.5mm jack or fuck em with that condom case of theirs.

DShaker24	Why no Super VOOC?
Big Boi	Do a vid on the huawei mate 20 pro
rubbers3	Disappointed about the headphone jack, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. I might be interested in getting it if it's on sale or something.
pingpong1138	Wanna know what's less intrusive than a notch, just having a black bar. A black bar doesn't cut a notch into videos/games/memes
Jani SIr	Well, that's more than double what I paid for my phone, and the only real difference is that it doesn't have a headphone jack.
Olaf Miklas	Notchn't.        Yes, I am a genius indeed. No need to praise me for this.
Off Colour	It's not a Linus Tech Tips video without a sponsor!üòÇ
Commodorefan64	No headphone jack, and still too expensive for my budget.
Mike G	I'm really uncomfortable. I just woke up and decided to watch some YouTube. I'm laying in bed with no shirt laying on my side holding my head up with my hand. I see there's a new LTT video so i click on it, still half asleep. It takes all of about 5 seconds of the video to feel like I just woke up to Linus in my bed. I smoked way too much last night.
Rafayel Islam	Wow! Techporn indeed!
Akshay Anand	They removed features. LOL. Especially after the software experience I had with my OP3 where one feature or the other would stop working with each update, I know never to give them my money.

SATA V	Well done Linus, you drink coffee the only way it should be brewed, French Press.
CaptObvious	Man I really wish this thing had a headphone jack, guess I have to look elsewhere to replace my 3t.
DanielRichards644	sponsored by the companies who product is featured in the video, not sure I much care for that.
T'airn'KA	At 4:10 you said that it will include a pre-applied screen protector, I presume like this, ie:  Amazon ($9.50 usd) - OnePlus 6T Screen Protector, KuGi 9H Hardness HD Clear Tempered Glass. Bottom line; Is the oneplus 6t worth buying versus a Samsung s9 or s10?
aniMEE	Yeah i dont have 1000$ but i do have 550 $
icantwords	For all of you complaining about the headphone jack: it‚Äôs going to happen to all phones anyway so you might as well embrace it and increase your arsenal of wireless tech. I highly doubt any company is going to bring it back when it makes them more money by increasing their sales of Bluetooth headphones.  This is a great phone and I would not hesitate to buy it even with the lack of a headphone jack just because of all the other advantages there are.  That being said, you‚Äôre all entitled to your opinion of course, so do what‚Äôs best for you, not me. üòÅ
3xplosiv0	why is the audio so muffled in this video
Ishaan Gupta	4:15 wait . What a condom type a case.
CPT.DoomWolf	just look at that price tag. just goes to show how much apple is ripping people off now lol.
DauntingKitty	Miles better than the XR
SickBoy offc	How about Meizu 16th? It's have under display fingerprint sensor, no notch, dual speaker, and still have jack.
Aerobic Dragoon	dem, Its cheaper than XR and it actually includes a fast charger WTF ONE PLUS FTW, FUCK APPLE SHEEPS *monkass*
darkinertia2	Linus always finds an excuse to get naked in a video lol
h mello	that box looks EXACTLY like a brazilian generic medication box
cosmosofinfinity	Maybe we gotta wait for the 7T for that headphone jack. And make the notch even smaller, hopefully. Like, it should literally JUST be the circle of the camera lens with no additional black besides that.
Robert Reitze	1:58 Glorious 8k footage perks! :D
Tyson Barker	I had a pocket pc in the early 2000's that required a headphone jack dongle. The jack was a mini and it needed the dongle for the regular sized headphone jack. Anybody else remember those?
Ketan Meshram	please review asus tuf
TheSonicFan4	Wow no headphone Jack. Pass.
Swaggy Batman	No headphone jack. No buy!!
chipmonk434	Everybody's (rightfully) complaining about the missing headphone jack, but honestly, that's the only real takeaway I see on this phone. It looks *excellent* otherwise! I even hate notches, but if you're going to do a notch, I think this is the best way to do it. They added a few extra pixels along the top so when you watch 16:9 videos, the notch doesn't cut in.  Honestly, really great shit. I genuinely mourn the loss of the headphone jack on it, but seeing as this is my only gripe, I would consider it a strong contender for my next phone.
Adam Halpin	Wireless is the future. Get used to it, nerds.
top lel	I wonder how an apple unboxing would sound like if they pay for it.. oh wait..
Jordan Nightingale	At 2:29 I really thought he was gonna Segway into the sponser of the videoüòÇüòÇ
TheBazzterd U'r Average Gamer	Stick with my G6+ moto, good enough :)
folkrav	People complaining about the lack of headphone jack : IT'S ON THE WAY OUT. Get used to it, they'll ALL remove it at some relatively close point in time. Yes, Samsung too.  I honestly don't agree with it, but it's going to go.
Mohamed	I am so done with all these big phones, why can't we get a smaller version of this? or the mi mix 3?
Chandan Soren	This made me go towards the 5z

SCHEISSKLAUS3D	headphone jack gone soybois who don't want the future to happen *rage*
Gareth Johnson	C'mon Linus, reviews of product directly sponsored by the company that produces them is just lame. It's a conflict way too far whatever your upstanding honesty. You can't be that desperate for money or misunderstand that conflict. Get a grip.
Tom Wom	LG used to have the draw pattern on screen to open apps.
Khaled Salhani	The Google Pixel just got slaughtered!
Arvid Johansson	I have a 3t and it is too big for me. The nexus 5 was a good size. That and the 3.5 mm is the only thing turning me off with this phone

Jnat	I used to be a OnePlus fan, i refuse to buy another one, unless they get the audio jack back LOL
mortl	I hope this phone won¬¥t sell and they¬¥ll have to include the headphone jack again.
Niklas Lehtel√§	Am I the only one who thought Linus was in the bathroom at 4:33?
Gungan	I'm sick of companies telling me i don't need a headphone jack. I dumped Sony because of it, and I'm not buying any phone without one.
Abdul Haq Shaik	Awesome new intro & outro
Akansh Chowdhary	I NEED A 3.5 MM JACK
Gr8Success	no headphone jack  . no sale.
This Guy Fucks	I'd be perfectly fine with the transition to USB type C instead of a headphone jack, as feasibly it's a real upgrade and accessories will catch up eventually. What I'm not ok with is the logic of "well we combined the functionality of the two port, so we get to remove one". I would MUCH rather have seen them just replace the 3.5mm headphone jack with another USB type C on the bottom, so you can charge and do whatever else you want at the same time. I see no reason why the manufacturers can't put 2 or even 3 USB type C connectors on the bottom of the phone, but removing the headphone jack and not replacing it with another port is a no go in my book.
MightyVox1	So it's almost caught up to the specs on the Huawei P10 Plus Apr 2017 model then? Except that it's bigger and heavier with like, less pixels and no headphones or SD card slot and a smaller battery... No wonder this had to be a paid promo, they must have known you would never pay money to test this out when a cheaper 1.5+ year old phone is better.
Ryan Loomis	I'll be getting the 8gb, 128GB STORAGE version, still have yet to fill up the 128GB of storage on my 5T.
sqwoodle	It's not a notch, it's a nipple. Can't wait to see Apple's phone nipple next year.
MrBlockyTV	Well that looked realy realy nice until the 3,5mm dongle
Klavs Eglitis	Sad to say.. but by by one+ hate that the phone will not have the headphone jack

alili1294	Sounds like "an ok phone" No headphone jack :(
Matthew Collier	With no IP waterproofing then I see no valid excuse as to why the headphone port was removed. Perhaps to make room for the fingerprint sensor? That's the only thing I'm sad about
Ravioli	I can't see any reason from the consumer perspective to NOT use a headphone jack. No 3.5, no buy üòû
RupertBoiJedi!	Linus caught in bed with oneplus 6t! üòÆ

Jyoti Prakash	i was expecting super vooc :(
frenchiveruti	Oh shoot it doesn't have a jack for audio, they can go trying to sell that crap to a moron

Chauncy Shou	worse than OP6
CIKEDEES	Now is the best time to buy the oneplus 6. Also I guess it's safe to say future oneplus phones won't be having the headphone jack either so it's time we stop buying their phones and look into options from other brands
Golden Life Gaming	remember when phone used to protect its cover instead of vic versa
BaSick	What are we cooking today linus?
Osu Ghoul	not as genius as apple
Solomon Kane	How do you listen to headphones when you have it plugged into a battery bank when you watch 8 to 12 hours of yt a day?
leinadkk	I dont need this outdated 3.5mm jack.. its very UNCOOL
MrGForce	the removal of the 3.5mm was no new news, they confirmed it a while back. Honestly, I think the 6t is boring and not really worth an upgrade from a 6. The removal of the 3.5mm may be inconvenient, but lets face it, that thing was over a century old and being outpaced by newer tech, whilst, relatively, taking in a lot of space.
Bruce Banner	I think mi mix 3 beats it
TheFiXaS	haha 3 finger slide to take a screenshot thats Xiaomi thing OnePlus just copied it
Linko994	Looks like a great device overall.. But: No headphone jack = No Buy.
GuardEzio	You know what... I'm disappointed that the headphone jack is gone but given everything else that OnePlus has put on the table, I think I'll stick with OnePlus once and upgrade to the 6T when I get the chance.
Hellurei hoho	underscreen fingerprint sensor is so awesome upgrade
Gavin Goh	the notch is ugly.
Blue Screen Gaming.	Tf is this audio quality
Kostas	A notch is still a notch and we 're not fooled. Plus not headphone jack is gonna be an even bigger dealbreaker. Shame, I wanted to try a One Plus phone as my next android device but now there's no chance.
Robert Cesario	How far the mighty fall. My heart broke when my One plus 3 broke. Amazing phone for the price, and I bought the one plus 6, and absolutely hate the notch and lackluster camera.   Why can't these companies stop following dumb trends?
rewtuser	Today was one clickbait thumbnail too far.  Later Dyson Tech Tips.  Can't say I'll miss you.
thegillband	Oneplus 6 is so last year according to Linus. Ouch..
KonfigPL	My thought of buying the OnePlus has disappeared just like the headphone jack. Who with me on this One?
jasper flanderhijn	is it just me, or is the audio quality quite potatoe?
Milan Svitek	Someone in the marketing department at OnePlus used more brainpower than usual when realising reviewers need more than 30 minutes to give a real hands-on review... Nice.
Kevin C	I feel bad for all you poor bastards still using wired headphones.
MrTrollTheMadGamer	No jack no buy
josh	buy fornite accounts here https://www.ebay.com/itm/292793840644
FantomLightning	I'll probably get bitched at for saying this... But I really hate the way OnePlus has done things over the years. Starting with the QC issues and total lack of support with the first OP,  leaving out anyone who needed CDMA support (unlike the Nexus devices, I thought this would be my replacement for them), and now the headphone jack... I'm honestly surprised anyone is willing to support this company, as IMO they're completely irrelevant...

Brian M	It's still a notch and a notch impinging on a screen while watching wide screen video whether it's on a phone, a computer, a TV, a monitor, a cinema screen.....it's still stupid, ugly and unnecessary. That's why it's not on TVs, or computers or monitors or cinema screens. It's only on mobile phones because many companies are too damn stupid to see what a design abortion it is. All I can say is, Thanks Samsung and Sony for being NOT stupid.
Thanveer Mohammed	They have cut the Jack for better battery that's awesome.
Marwyn Castillo	Ok...
BabaKral ReisPro	I have lg g7 thinQ : it has powerful and perfect hifi quad dac headphone output, microSD card slot, ƒ±p68 and mil-std-810g certificate, very good wide angle camera, slightly worse than other flagships' night performance, battery lasts min. 2 days, charge very fast.

Ti Ri	Why the actual fuck do phonemakers build phones with glass backs and NO WIRELESS CHARGING? Wasn't that the purpose of glass backs in the first place? Double the crackability with no extra advantage. I would have preferred aluminum instead.
avanish chandra	Vivo v11 pro have same design . Not comparing the two devices but countering their logic of removing the headphone jack

admirnaruto	I wonder one thing, now I personally don't really care that much for the 3.5mm jack, I don't mind using the dongle/type-c. But the biggest argument I see for wanting the 3.5mm jack is, so you can charge your phone while using your head phones. But I really want to know, how many people use their headphone while charging their phone? This is a legit question, don't want to mock anyone, I personally was never in a situation where I was charging my phone and using headphones. And if you do, can you also tell me how often does that happen?

SoneDiadem	All these fake op fans without the wireless bullets complaining bout no headphone jack
Miko	Finally something to upgrade to from my Nexus 5.
KingofHearts67	Honestly the headphone jack is a deciding factor for me, I use it all the time when plugging my phone into my car stereo and I really don't want to constantly worry about whether I have my extra dongle to plug my phone in to listen to music, not to mention the fact that I also like to charge my phone when driving so then I would need the splitter dongle in the car and the normal dongle when I don't want a whole extra cable hanging off for charging. Honestly how hard can it be to just include a headphone jack?
Clement Koefoed Rasmussen	I thought this video was not as... complete as your other mobile phone reviews. Maybe because oneplus themselves was the sponsor. For example the Note 9 review was a bit more complete and critical :))
Abe The Egyptian Pharaoh	Oppo f9 already had this notch a long time ago lol

Theo Filter	I don¬¥t know if I should switch from Apple to Android... So i have an iPhone 6 now and I want to Upgrade and I would get the new OnePlus 6T or the iPhone XR but the price difference is about 300$ and thats much but I don¬¥t know it is to switch to Android because I like it that the iPhone gets Software updates for such a long time and on Android this isn¬¥t the Case. So what so you think???
WhoaNellyJake	I never need to see naked-in-bed Linus again
ThatGuy	I would actually still buy it.
Omega Gamer	i just watched linus's entire video in 4k without fps drop on a late 2013 imac lol
L. Gyger	Why do all manufacturers remove the 3.5mm jack nowadays... I don't wanna support Apple (I do have an iPhone 6s, but a refurbished one, so I technically didn't support Apple), I hate Android and Windows Phone doesn't have the functions I need. I seriously don't know which smartphone to buy anymore. I'm probably going back to my old Nokia. At least I can use that one for a week without recharging.

GhostPanda X	Samsung and LG, I salute you for keeping the headphone jack. Please don't remove it. Especially for the S10/S10+/S10X (you get the point). Prove the rumors wrong.  Disclaimer: Rumors pertain to future Samsung devices, and not LG.

Franci2a	Still plagued by every single design flaw that has pretty every midrange-flagship phone from 2017 to 2018. Then too bad.
Strafe	I don't really understand why people make such a big deal out of not having a headphone jack. OnePlus' charging is fantastic, to the point where you're almost never going to have to use the dongle while you want to charge the phone. Yeah it's an extra $20 for the earbuds but if you're not on T-Mobile you're paying $550< upfront anyways. I can understand why people might be upset why people will miss the headphone jack, but I will never understand why someone would straight-up refuse to buy a phone because of it.
Richard Servello	Bid farewell to headphones?  Why....THEY STILL WORK!!!  Get over the legacy port!!  I have 1 pair of wired headphones left and I just leave the dongle attached. It's seriously not hard!
Sasquatch	When will these fucking people that make and design phones understand that WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE SHIT?! PUT A BLOODY JACK IN IT EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE DAMN PHONE THICKER, JUST LIKE YOUR GOD DAMN HEAD.  Geez, I'm sorry for letting out steam but fucking come on, what is the shit that phone designers have against headphone jacks these days?
Sporp	Still hemming and hawing over my next phone purchase. Still rocking a Pixel 1, and it's definitely showing it's age. With the S9+ probably going on sale for black friday/cyber monday, I think I may hold out for that. But I had an older galaxy and I really don't want to have to root my phone to uninstall their preinstalled garbage. Headphone jack isn't a deal breaker for me, but idk. Anyone have an S9+ or OnePlus 6 (or 6T) have any thoughts?
MrVikscool	Oneplus busted Linus by posting his picture of the event on their instagram handle..... üòÇüòÇü§£

raju 420	Osm yar no headphone jack
superQuizzie	I don't like how the base model price is shifting up every time. Like if I can buy it for $500, that would be great please.
Heightren	Confirmed Linus sleeps barechest
Jonathan Taylor	I just want an updated Axon 7 experience. Front facing speakers, capacitive navigation buttons, AMOLED qhd display, rear fingerprint scanner, and of course a headphone jack all around a $400 pricepoint. I don't mind bezels at all. They give a little bit of breathing room when holding the phone one handed with the bottom corner resting in your palm.
quangluu96	I called that notch the cyclop.
Arion Florin	I bought the Meizu 16th with 6 gb / 64 Gb with 3.5 jack and NO notch! Just 440 $
Eduardo Avila	Better off getting a pocophone f1, it has even sd card slot and heaphone jack, and costs way less than that
Bernard Wong	Please test the speakers and compare it to the Oneplus 6, iPhone X, and Note 9. It's literally the only thing stopping me from buying this phone, the speakers on Oneplus phones in the past has been hot garbage and it'd be interesting to see if that new thin slit of a speaker grille at the top makes a difference.
wadez1000	I was going to buy this but nooooooooooo.
Michael S.	Hmm, may buy this. Looks nice. Biggest selling point is stock-ish android, followed by all other features.  How good is the camera????

Squiggy	Day 3 of asking linus if he can help me get a PC
Dgeigerd	omg no headphone jack. in the last few years i switched completely to bt audio. And i can leave the type c adapter on my OnePlus Icons. OnePlus is so great that just a removed headphone jack isn't making me leaving OnePlus.
Killacamfoo O.G.	NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO BUY. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. NO LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT. NO BUY.
dasenase	I was triggered when he said "speaking of dropping stuff"
Patrick Doll	I have to say I am not a fan of these tech-overviews/reviews that are sponsored by the discussed manufacturer. Its something different for someone like cablemod to sponsor a cable-management video. I trust Linus on never intententionally lying to his audience about a product but this just always rubs me wrong.

Machina	If this phone had a 3.5mm jack it would have been the best smartphone of 2018 hands down, from price to performance to features it would have topped everything else on the market it's a real shame the settled on that.

Sic Semper Beats	That‚Äôs a dope phone. Actually the first android phone where I‚Äôm not pissed by no headphone jack
Ryanrocksize 5	No 3.5mm headphone jack = no purchase from me . I can't live without it , trust me , you will understand after misplacing your dongle too many times and forgetting to charge your Bluetooth headphones , leaving you stranded to outside noise when you least want it .
Mr Snakes	a sponsored review? Really?
Namesii xd	The notch is smaller but somehow it looks even dumber now.
Ghost Yunus	Transparent condom type case wow.
kondinator	Would buy if it had a headphone jack.
imicca	if it is SPONSORED ... how can this be not biased? OnePlus 6T has  Same Snapdragon 845 Same 6/8GB RAM Same Camera Same no Wireless and IP6X Same $550, but pay again. Not same headphone jack. Not same, slower in-screen scanner, ok... worth it?

Mukhlas Hidayat	No headphone jack. No, thank you.
Kakashi Hatake	Front fingerprint print sensors ftw.. as for headphone jack, I think it is high time we put our pitchforks down. Now that OnePlus removed it, and Samsung too will(according to the rumours), it's a losing battle..
Jose Castillo	you know how wierd this is MKBHD just released a video before you and Austin Evans could ever upload. womp wooooooooomp
dbuds & T-Iozef Official	Hope that you used the condom case.
inao	I think Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is better :d
Sangeet Khatri	With the headphone jack now gone, OnePlus's should change their tagline from "Never Settle" to "Settle a bit".

Vovical	This seems like a good phone *5 minutes later* Oh, they removed the headphone jack for no reason even though it could have fit into the phone, making an ultimate retard decision and shooting themselves in the foot for anyone who doesn't want to live with dongles? No buy from me. I'll just buy the non "T" variant of this phone. here's a few phones as of september 2018 which have the jack. https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/8/17424792/phone-headphone-jack-3-5mm-buy-list I know it's from the verge (uSe tHe PaDs So ThE pOwEr SuPpLy WoN't ShOrT cIrCuIt Ur SyStEm) but it's a good list
Minjae Kwak	Linus can‚Äôt believe that the headphone jack is gone.....
RJL	So what's the deal with headphone jack? I don't see the problem, you get the adaptercable with it, so just stick that to your headphones and you're done. If you have to bring the headphones, what is the big deal of having to carry that small adapter piece with the headphones?
MSSoulBlader	OnePlus Settled. Not worth it if there's no jack.
Rishabh Sukhija	Removal of headphone jack makes buying samsung more logical
Tom Scherer	Nobody seems to notice, but they also removed the LED notification light!
Tudz	Notch OR no headphone jack? Which one will you choose? :)

ZombiePanda402	Why is every company following apple and removing the headphone jack? If a phone doesn't have an SD card slot or a headphone jack I won't even consider purchasing it.
MX26	Man the removal of the headphone jack is a huge bummer :( There's still a loot about OP phones that will probably make me stick with them after my OP3 dies, but Samsung and LG are now under consideration for me again...
David Batty	Wow that fingerprint scanner makes it useless for anyone with big hands.  Oh well.  But settling is the way for one plus.
MobiusSeckOne	I keep my 6! Fuck the the under the screen scanner, I keep my headphone jack.
Channel VR	The problem with LINUS is ......he's got "Boerenverstand"  witch is Dutch for Common sense .... and finally BIG companies are seeing what he is trying to tell them all  A LONG LONG TIME !!!! so maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel thanks to Linus and product are gone get better and better till there Linus .
