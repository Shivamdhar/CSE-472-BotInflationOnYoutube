M1G_ xD	Guld 1
Sam Sydenham	Matt get ronaldo and a icon rf
Blaze Murti	7/10
adel asery	I‚Äôd make a tactic to change the formation to 41212-2   Kante as a CDM Mbappe at CAM and I guess the attacking force is pretty obvious üòÇ
Alfie Walker	8
Benbrumm 123	6/10 because that formation is not as good this FIFA
zain taleb	10/10
Matthew Kelleghan	4-2-3-1 narrow GK Ter staygen, Sule and Boating Muier and kurzawa as my back line. Two CDM verratie and Diarra. My three CAM Messi in the middle Guiliet and Klivert as my three CAM. My striker is very weird but he scored 36 goal in 27 games and his name is Paco Alc√°cer
Brandon Stewart	10 out of 10 also keep up the good work
Charlie Mann	Silver 3 üòÇüòê
Luca Ford	Were are u from I‚Äôm from Sheffield

Jai Tannous	Please tell us how much use have spent on Fifa points
Liam Matthews	6/10 for me Matt. Great players but a weak formation considering the qualities of your midfield. None of your midfield options can shoot which can be annoying if you keep finding them on the edge of the box. Switch to a 4-3-3 (3) with 2 CDM's and a CM and get rid of one of your Defence minded midfielders for a more rounded one?
