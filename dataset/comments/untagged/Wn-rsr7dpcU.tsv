raidernation901	Braxton I was raised a LA Raider fan I was born in 81 I didn't know our history or tradition , I always thought we were the LA Raiders until we went back to Oakland in 95 and for a while it took me along time to call us the Oakland Raiders, but in High school after I did my research I found out our history and tradition started in Oakland so as a grown man in his 30's I know we belong in Oakland, hope we make this happen #foreveroakland
Braxton Oertwig	My name is Braxton Oertwig of Las Vegas Nevada, I just wanted to say that I have been a life long fan of the OAKLAND RAIDERS; kept on following the raiders when AL Davis decided to move the team to LA because he was not going to be told by the NFL at the time that he could not move his team out of OAKLAND. I to this day i felt he had made a mistake when he moved to LA but I forgave him when he moved back in 1995 to OAKLAND.  I believe the truth about the history of the Raiders and RAIDER NATION  lies in the city of OAKLAND, is it not true that the most note worthy games for the  Raiders claim to NFL fame was the( HOLY ROLLER GAME, THE GHOST IN THE POST GAME, THE IMMACULATE RECPTION GAME, THE FAMOUS HIDY GAME VS THE JETS) ALL CAME AS THE OAKLAND RAIDERS NOT THE LA RAIDERS BUT THE OAKLAND RAIDERS. As OAKLAND RAIDER NATION FANS we were proud and still are Proud of this heritage the players from these OAKLAND RAIDER SQUADS gave us TO BE THE MOST PROUDEST WIN LOSE TIE UNTIL WE DIE OAKLAND RAIDER FANS OUT THERE; because the players from the OAKLAND RAIDERS squads were tough SOB'S that never took crap from the opposition they will always have my respect forever.  Now with all of that being said, I cannot believe there is a chance the raiders might be moving back to LA and if that does come true I WILL RETIRE MYSELF FROM THE RAIDER NATION AS A OAKLAND RAIDER FAN THAT IS WHERE MY HEART LIES WITH THE OAKLAND RAIDERS AND THE OAKLAND RAIDER NATION. I believe the Raiders fans that are in LOS ANGELES SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BEGINING OF WHERE THE RAIDERS CAME FROM AND HELP THE CITY OF OAKLAND COME TO A DEAL TO GET COLISEUM CITY ON TRACK  BECAUSE OAKLAND IS WHERE THE RAIDERS BELONG. TO THOSE IN LOS ANGELES THAT CLAIM TO BE RAIDER FANS AND WANT TO STEAL THEM BACK YOU LACK SLIVER AND BLACK AND YOU SHOULD BECOME RAMS FANS BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU DONT KNOW THE RAIDERS HISTORY AT ALL.  MR DAVIS UNDERSTAND THIS, SOME THINGS ARE WORTH MORE AND GO BEYOND  MONEY AND THAT IS THE  RAIDERS HISTORY WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND. PLEASE TRY TO STAY IN OAKLAND SIR I BELIEVE YOU CAN ITS POSSIBLE.
