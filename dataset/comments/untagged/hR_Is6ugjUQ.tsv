Black Lotus	TEXAS RED
Dez Povey	Congratulations Texans for the huge turn out...MAGA USA USA We are with you Sen Cruz
J.J. W.	Everyone who believes in making America great, needs to vote red!
Cerebral Moribundity	Here`s a thought : building the Wall is a massive undertaking, yes? Trump should invite America`s allies to send their military Engineer battalions to America for on the job training.  This is a large scale construction project, most Engineers would jump at the training opportunities if the materials were provided.  Even just one  mile per battalion, in strategic locations along the border, would be a big help. Excellent opportunity for engineers from different countries and the U.S. to practice working together on a really large scale project. There would be additional buildings, roads, communications architecture etc also required.
John Taylor	Jobs not mobs!
PatriciaMcAll	Shoot to kill every illegal alien group attempting to break into the US! Drop bombs and drones. Americans must be protected!   Americans need to get to the polls and vote for the Republicans! This invasion of these millions of illegal aliens, are being encouraged to break into the US by Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and the Democratic Party! This act is part of the Democrats attempting to overthrowing the US government!  These illegal aliens have already invaded the US. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, there are 750,000 students, with approximately 550,000, 80 percent, are Hispanics/Latinos/Asians and Filipinos! This is the same throughout California and the US!  Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and other Democrats are behind smuggling millions of illegals into the US!
Lisa Rodriguez	God bless President Trump and   God bless America!  But this invasion must stop now! The caravan is mocking every single American by waving their flag and demanding entry.  So what we don't have borders now. We have the US Marines, Army, and Militias....all right by me!!!  Now looks like a good time to send them in...and pray for them all...
Blackfoot Indian Bigfoot	If Texas or Florida turns blue they will be an California shithole in no time. Its unbelievable that's even a possibility. Smh.
C. B.	Veto Beto
Gabriel Jimenez	More people outside than inside. Where does Mr Trump get his energy.
Executive Coup	O'Rourke is a "Beto" male.üòÅ
Simon Templar	The USA voted Trump in 2016.  We the people must continue this positive movement to put the USA citizens first by voting Republican this midterm.  Don't settle for less or you will experience a horrible mess.
Tim Brook	The deep state has and will continue to greatly underestimate the POTUS. He is five moves ahead of them.
