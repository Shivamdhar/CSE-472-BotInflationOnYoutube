MysticUmbreon	Alright so I don't get 1k comments about Gyarados not getting Crunch use bite. There you go problem solved. I thought for sure it got crunch oops.
Lab Rats Battles	The one thing that makes Staraptor so great: it's the only starter bird to learn a Fighting-type move, and I agree with you, he looks so rad!
thedazzlingshell101	I feel like if you don't want to use Gyardos, Floatzel would be another great option. Its early on at the Valley Windworks as a Buzel (sorry if my spelling is off), but once you evolve it, it becomes a rather cool Pokemon. (Plus its not 4X weak to electric type attacks)
Timmynator 9000	Torterra, Floatzel, Staraptor, Garchomp, Luxray, HM-slave or Lucario
Gage Waltner	My biggest complaint about pokemon you tubers is that they all have 1-2 minute intros that are completely stoppable, anyone else feel?
Rick Mannion	Dude piplup and turtwig are both trash everyone knows chimchars the best not opinion change my mind
barrowkade	Torterra is my favourite starter of all time but its not as good as the others :(
CrazyMangoz	Here is my altered version of this team it is made to include all the HMs to get through the game tell me what you think!    Torterra: woodhammer, earthquake, crunch, rock, slide.  Staraptor: close combat, fly, cut, return.  Gallade: psycho cut, close combat, leaf blade, night slash  Gyarados: earthquake, waterfall, ice fang, surf  Kangaskhan: strength, rock climb, rock smash, rest (scrappy for kangaskhans ability)
UltimateHero128	Torterra was my Pearl starter. I have no regrets. Infernape was Diamond, Empoleon was Platinum.
Noah Tackett	Isn't dragon dance a gen 5 move? Also, Bidoof. Perfect HM slave
Tristan Stoner	Instead of lickilicky i went with Blissey
Andrew Shaw	I think Luxray's better than Lickilicky
Zuzumita	Lickilicky is a really good pokemon imo   It gets access to stab Explosion (A feat only possible for Lickilicky iirc) which can KO most pokemon in the game and has a really diverse movepool, however A physical set is what works for me so wew (You can run a special variant if you want) Also it's decently bulky so it's likely to survive lots of attacks (as long as they're not fighting type)  Held Items should really only be either a silk scarf or leftovers (maybe even expert belt :thinking:)  For moves i'd suggest: Return - Most reliably powerful stab move it has (Next to explosion) Explosion - For all reasons above (Also for when Lickilicky's about to faint/A last-ditch effort Power Whip - Great power and deals with pesky rock types The last move can be anything from Fire Punch to Gyro ball tbh (I would recommend fire punch/flamethrower though to deal with steel types)  For a special variant you could use: Return - (unfortunately Lickilicky doesn't really get a good normal stab special move apart from hyper beam so you'll have to make do) Hyper Beam - (Basically a lower powered, less risky explosion, although it leaves you vulnerable for a turn)  Water Pulse/Surf - (Same reason for power whip, deals with rock/ground types) Flamethrower (or if you're feeling risky, Focus Blast) - (for steel types)  Lickilicky has always been one of my favorite pokemon and it's for all of the reasons above and it's really underrated the only thing I don't like is that it's really slow, but that's not that big of a deal tbh also explosion is a fairly difficult TM to obtain in platinum (but trust me, it's worth it)  Anyway those are just the sets I use, feel free to use them yourself or modify them!
Gabriel Silva Rocha	Hippowdown is also a great filler option for the team btw
Random human	My team is İnfernape Staraptor Garchomp Lucario Gastrodon Leafeon
scizor squad	Turtwig was my first and one of my favorite starters so the beginning triggers me but it’s ok
Broseph	But I love torterra
Infinite Bacon	Just completed a run with this end team! Decided to play a bit faster than normal and managed to beat Cynthia within 22:10 of game time (a pretty good time for me, I like to explore more typically).  But due to the speed at which I was playing, I didn't end up filling out the entire moveset for each Pokémon, as by the end the highest level was my level 52 Gyarados. Thankfully, as it turns out 6 dragon dances is just enough to sweep Cynthia's entire lineup.  In other words, had a lot of fun trying this out!
greek1237	You hate the grass Turtle? It was my favorite of the gen 4 starters.
Ganon Tice	*I love torterra!!*
Draco roblox bad piggies more	Lickilicky @ Expert Belt   Ability: Own Tempo   - Swords Dance   - Cut   - Earthquake   - Zen Headbutt
kenny chen	It's ehhh..
Oliver Cloezoff	WHY the hate, not just from you but people in general I don't understand!
Ash Ketchum	You don’t have a good mix of physical and special attackers. Almost the whole team has better attack stat than special att stat Also it’s isn’t really great to have Pokémon to share types. So I wouldn’t have 2 normal and 2 flying types. So I’d swap gyarados and lickilicky.   Swap lickilicky with porygon(eventually porygon Z) which you can get before finishing the game   And swap gyarados with a special attacking water type. Perhaps vaporeon
Billy Creates	*the moment u have diamond but not platinum*
Willem Wijaya	You suck as pokemon game
Jack Patterson	But Torterra is great!
Garnetore Gladiator	It’s funny that his favourite starter is the only one worse then torterra
mukesh md	What about Ariel ace instead of takedown
Youssef Lataoui	How do you get past heart home city the second time you get to it
yanniek pijper games ypg	I actually like torterra
Meta Knight	Yay i love torterra
Caiden Magill	Starraptor is my favorit bird
Sweet Tea	Lmao u guys are hypocrites saying staraptor and houndoom is bad in other sinnoh vids and then completely contradicting that
Roblox ultra Beast	It worked kind of
MALOE	hey mystic I got a request i'm currently doing a ultra sun journey & well i'm gonna take on the elite 4 in a few months & I wanna know what should my final team's moveset be for my pokemon ultra sun journey? i'm just asking you to give my team some final moves & describe where I can find each move because i'm not changing any of these pokemon because they are my final teams & pick each move carefully for their natures to fit anyways here is the teams for the elite 4  part 1  Robin Hood The Male Decidueye Level 59: Naughty nature (+attack -special defense) ability: overgrow  Kahili The Female Toucannon Level 57: Gentle nature (+special defense -defense) ability: skill link  Lana The Female Araquanid Level 57: Docile nature (+nothing -nothing) ability: water bubble  Hapu The Female Mudsdale Level 56: Mild nature (+special attack -defense) ability: own tempo  Roark The Male Rampardos Level 56: Sassy nature (+special defense -speed) ability: mold breaker  JoltSpeed The Male Jolteon Level 56: Serious nature (+nothing -nothing) ability: volt absorb  part 2  Robin Hood The Male Decidueye Level 69: Naughty nature (+attack -special defense) ability: overgrow  Kahili The Female Toucannon Level 67: Gentle nature (+special defense -defense) ability: skill link  Lana The Female Araquanid Level 67: Docile nature (+nothing -nothing) ability: water bubble  Hapu The Female Mudsdale Level 66: Mild nature (+special attack -defense) ability: own tempo  Roark The Male Rampardos Level 66: Sassy nature (+special defense -speed) ability: mold breaker  JoltSpeed The Male Jolteon Level 66: Serious nature (+nothing -nothing) ability: volt absorb  also no egg moves at all or post game moves till part 2
Arry Reddy	Luxrayy
Gavin Mauk	I recently did a Normal-type run of Diamond, and I had a fast Clefable that knew Flamethrower, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hyper Beam. Keeping it just a couple levels above the trainers had it going first and destroying.   I also ran Bibarel (practically Water-type starter), Staraptor (so good and neutralizes Fighting weakness), Blissey (Toxic, etc.) Lopunny (basically my Fighting-type, knew Dig) Girafarig (Psychic- and Ghost- type move special attacker).
Roxas	Torterra is love
Nedu Egeh	10:50 - 10:53 I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks way too many people sleep on Lickilicky.
Takato 214	What do you think of dusknoir
Moises Cañeca	I had a similar team right now except I have Lucario for lickylicky and gardevoir for gallade
Caspar Alderson	I'm skint but those tees and hoodies are sweet
Jeddy Steve	I think that Gastrodon is better due to only one weakness, and has good bulk with usable special attack. I know it's a repeat type, but having a good water type that can also be a backup ground type to Torttera. Also it's got early access as well as having surf, which means you don't need a Lickylicky on your team since even though I like Lickylicky, A lot of people don't. Also keep in mind that Gastrodon can learn ice beam so Garchomp won't sweep your team. Even though Garrados(I probably spelt this wrong because I'm too lazy to look it up) can learn ice fang, it's not as good as ice beam.
ChillMoogle	Both Gastrodon and Snorlax have slower speed 90% of Torterras segment you talked about it’s passable 56 speed
Kinsai	I would recommend replacing Take Down with Return once Staraptor reaches max happiness. It's the strongest Normal attack move without any drawbacks.
Henry Rubio-Ventura	Lickilicky is a physical attacker not a special attacker.
Max Ettling	Sinnoh has the best starters
noa Kastle	Why not curse instead of crunch
ProKobe	Torterra is my favorite Pokémon ;(
x Hasan	Redo Infernape The original one sucks
Jared Kinz	i used torterra in my first game and used Torterra Staraptor Luxray Machamp Palkia Poliwhirl (and eventually Poliwrath)  idek what i was thinking
Starter Paks	My torterra is always bomb and super fast
LegenderyFox	Good night, well I'm Brazilian and I'm learning English, and I do not understand everything, but can I put subtitles? Well, thank you for reading.
Luke Chan	shouldn't staraptor know how to use roost?
Joy Chowdhury	U still need to make a Venusuar,Typhlosion,Feraligtyr and Swampert edition
Inferno Burns	I agree Stataptor is my second favorite bird after Pidgeot.
Ben Naughton	Why Torterra is actually good ( not to spite you or anything just that it's one of my favourite starters. Please don't hate me)  For starters ( pun intended), even though Torterra is weak to Infernape, the best Infernape can do for a while is flame wheel, which is easily tankable thanks to it's bulky defence. Yes, special attacks cripple it, but would you actually see an Infernape use a special move?  Second, moves like Giga Drain can be helpful as it sacrifices a bit of power for the ability to heal. Curse could also be viable as it's already slow as heck, why not just up it's other stats instead ( I used only grottle to beat gardenia using curse so it's a good early game option) What I'm saying is that not all pokemon have to only have attacking moves. Synthesis could also be another option.  Third, many pokemon could be used to build a team around as the vast amount of TMs that can be put on certain pokemon covers most of Torterra's weaknesses. Personally, getting an altaria in this gen is extremely useful as it can be taught moves like ice beam and earthquake , giving it to Gallade it kind of a waste as fighting moves cover some of the things that earthquake is super effective againts ( Steel, rock etc) Even if you Have some other weaknesses, your fire type ( or in my instance a clefable with flamethrower) can deal with those threats for you.  Finally, I think that torterra is a pokemon for more advanced players to use. It's tanky nature makes it difficult to grasp for the less experienced players, making Infernape as good as it is kind of an easy mode for the game. Understanding that not all pokemon are fast sweepers makes it easier to appreciate how good Torterra is ( Not saying to don't expect all pokemon to be fast sweepers, it's just your preferance).   I hope that you appreciate what I was saying. I'm not trying to make you look bad or anything. I'm just spreading mu opinion out a  bit. Thanks! ( Btw I reaaaallly love your channel :3)
Anthony Gulick	This dude is so biased... never seen anyone hate torterra this much. Going to say it’s the worst starter of all time is complete BS
Jose Salas	Wouldn't it be better to carry curse instead of crunch?
Justine Mariano	Galade is MOST VALUABLE POKEMON
Rossy james	Wow!
Judith D	Yes Torterra!!! My young self who knew nothing about types actually used torterra to beat the Ice gym. Torterra is beast
Tyren Prowell	My Torterra had helped me beat the kento leaders in the pwt torterra exactly got a good move set stone Edge dragon rage leaf storm Nd earthquake
Amolik blesson Singh	Well I think that lickilicky is actually equal to snorlax
Louwrens	I always go for Shinx on the first route it is A not really good at first but once it had evolved into luxio this thing rocks and its final stage luxray is A really good mon as well and is in my opinion A great addition to the team.
MadMike96	since i had diamond and Platinum, I've sent a chimchar and Turtwig to platinum so I've got Empoleon, Torterra, Infernape, Electivire, Staraptor and Gliscor you didn't mention any trading pokemon.
Fyntom2	Torterra is completely my favorite, can't believe this :'(
Michael Hendrix	I'm tryna figure out if you know adam22, he references someone he calls mystic when hes talking about pokemon go, if you are part of the rope gang then that makes my day.
Rami Saab	Magnazone...... 😩😩😩
Timekeeper Zaphkiel	Hi Mystic, I'm doing your Best teams in my pokemon games. I got a Shiny turtwig when i copied this. SO HYPED!!!!
Nathan Parker	I'm so glad to see my favorite Pokémon on this team
Jordan Duggan	9:56 B I B A R E L M A S T E R R A C E
yago padilha	I love using Turtwig and Honchkrow on the team
demonte mccoy	Me personally I would use ambipom than licklylicky
OpErAtiOn Seiged	Highscool dxd anyone?
Hugo Santos	"Licklicky" BOI
Fiona Wallace	Torrtera is the best starter. So screw you
Damon Frey	Is the a possibility of a samurott black 1 team
FaceOff Power	My team would be  Torterra Crobat  Gyarados  Houndoom Medicham  Porygon-Z
Marielena Potts	Torterra is actually better than Empoleon, you and HDEvee really need to stop labelling it as bad all because of speed  ""But it's based off a turtle!" (Correction: tortoise, and yes, there is a big difference between the two) that's cool, I get the concept. If you like the design that's dope. The problem lies with its speed" Did your microphone glitch out at some point and you didn't know it cut off some of your dialogue, or you intentionally or unintentionally edit out what you said after talking about the design and before going back to the stats or did you actually just try to sweep the design's explanation for the low speed under the rug and hope that no one notices? Complaining about speed, understanding the reason why and ignoring it and going straight back to complaining just looks pathetic.  "The problem is it gets outran by literally everything" oh yeah there definitely aren't any slower Pokemon out there, and ALL Pokemon that don't have high speed are hopeless (this sentence is sarcastic by the way). It's not only a TORTOISE (again, not a turtle) but it's also a CONTINENT. Both are known for moving slow, and continents can cause limitless amounts of destruction no matter how fast they move. And you STILL expect these two combined to be as fast as at least a little kid on a bike or scooter? And you clearly never heard of the story "the tortoise and the hare". Also there are moves and items that deal with its speed, stop labelling slow as bad
Allen Duncan	I got to say togekiss is better than staraptor can support take hits and dish out damage plus serene grace awesome movepool
Chris Cooper, random man of music	Sounds like you're saying Brek Brek instead of Brick Break
Goran Yugi Dubravic	My team in diamond was Torterra, Luxray, Staraptor, Floatzol, Rapidash, and Lucario!
theRJschannel	Suggestions for the BW Samurott and Serperior: Samurott Team: 1. Samurott 2. Stoutland 3. Swoobat 4. Krookodile 5. Darmanitan 6. Ferrothorn  Serperior team 1. Serperior 2. Stoutland 3. Swoobat 4. Seismitoad 5. Darmanitan 6. Vanillux  There's not too many in the original BW games, but I grew up with these so I know some good coverage with these guys. And Mystic, if you're wondering why I chose some over others you might've thought of, here are some reasons; -Swoobat has a base 114 speed compaired to Sigilyphs' 97 speed. Sure Woobat has much less Sp Atk than Sigilyph, but it still has some nice STAB moves for the game and can do away with Bianca's/Cheren's Pignite/Emboar and Cheren's Serperior. -Seismitoad is a great water and ground type, while not having much in terms of coverage, it shuts down Elisa's Volt Switch tactics greatly and Tympole evolves rather fast -Vanillux because flying type coverage I can't think of any other, but I would appreciate if you gave these some thoughts.
Otto Kapanen	I went with: Torterra  Luxray Gastrodon Drifblim Drapion Froslass
Rhyperior Ranger	I love Torterra. My team is  Torterra  Gastrodon  Togekiss  Drapion Magmortar  Lucario
Dylan Ward	why does barry have a torterra on his team?
Master MoJo	Torterra  Magmortar Gryrados  Staraptor Garchomp Electivire
riotmaster145	You can teach Torterra rock polish or to make it’s speed way better
Eduarte's Productions	At 7:10 why does Barry have Torterra? He's suppose to have Empoleon.
ArchetypeGotoh	Tropius -fly -flash -strength -cut  Bibarel -Surf -Waterfall -Rock Smash -Rock Climb
Surinder Garg	You can use garchomp
muncher videos	#4 gen gamer am part pilup  people
Slovakian Mapping	My god how many videos do I have to comment if the have the defence to tank then u don’t need speed if u can easily take hits then speed don’t matter
JimmyXP	Turtwig was my first starter in pearl, hes a beast
Brian Ludwig	How is Mega Houndoom a disservice? I don't see anything wrong with it, and the fact that it got a mega is a streak of luck.
Keshav Agarwal	I like all sinnoh starters and their evolution, except one.can you guess which one?
Nathan Dawe	Finally
Anthony Hand	When you just decided to restart platinum again. Perfect timing
Sean Davis	torterra was and always will be my favorite starter no debate
a cat that is stripy	Garydos. GARYDOS. Not to be mean but it's gyrados to me to pronounce it is gi-ra-dos not ga-ra-dos
Caleb Chmelyk	FUQ U MAN TORTERRAS COOL AS FUCK BRO
Ariel Roa	Have u consider playing Pokémon revolution online its basically most of the regions in one game
Ian Animations	This is my team for Sinnoh: Torterra Staraptor Luxray Floatzel Houndoom Lucario  This team kicked ass!!! One of my favorite team so far
The Officer Friendly	My team when I beat the game with Torterra: Torterra Staraptor Luxray Medicham Houndoom Vaporeon
Britney Young	Hi
Phoenixlord123	Finally a team for my favorite starter
Moon DarkWolf	Can I just say that this was literally my team (except lickylicky) on my first platinum team  My team was  Torterra Staraptor Luxray  Gallade Gyrados Garchomp Houndoom   What can I say I’m super shocked
Michael 5	Floatzel would be a good water type too. It has a great speed and attack
Joan Aguayo Planell	Okay, let's tear apart this crap while I watch.  Off a good start: Complains about torterra's speed. Never even considers Rock Polish.  Return is THAT much better.  Gallade has completely redundant moves with Torterra. Also extremely overrated.  Gyarados is good. Guess even a broken clock is indeed right twice a day.   Lickilicky sucks. Having a million TMs available won't matter with that mediocre attacking stats. If you want a tanky attacker just bring Bronzong and consider using Trick Room to fix Torterra's speed without having to invest in the Rock Polish TM, not like you will need it for anything, but I guess it opens a slot for Torterra to bring Stealth Rock to the table, wich is always a good thing to have.   Houndoom is SHIT. For the love of Arceus just use Garchomp instead, you can even get him right away after the second gym in Platinum. He got banned from competitive for a reason. Please don't ever bring up again this trash pokemon who couldn't even use a mega evolution right.
Nick Ellis	Yeah, I'm not paying nearly £50 for a hoodie
Connor Stevens	Staraptor is Both normal/flying Gyarados is flying and lickilicky is normal- ergo I can’t use Staraptor or Gyarados/Lickilicky Sorry. Replacements? None of the types of Torterra Houndoom Or Gallade Staraptor or Gyarados/Lickilicky
YoBoi Nebby	Torterra is always going to be my favourite starter of all time, i love it so much (mainly because of nostalgia but still) and i like standing up for the under dogs. When I play sinnoh I usually use Torterra, Staraptor, Floatzel, Mismagius, Yanmega and the last one is never really the same but usually its just like a skuntank or something.
Namenlos	My Team: Torterra  Luxray  Staraptor Garchomp Weavile Lucario
Ryan Mc Kenna	Are you going to do a best for Infernape for Platinum?
Jose Sosa	Dat best starter edtition 💯
Dudeldani	Torterra Houndoom Togekiss Golduck Weavil And magnemites last evolution
HimSnow	Best turtle pokemon.
Daniel Furman	I used Torterra, Staraptor, Luxray, Floatzel, Houndoom and Lucario, have to say it was super super difficult, especially some of the later gyms, Cyrus, Cynthia (Floatzel's Ice Fang did 1/4 of Garchomps health) and the double battle against Volkner and Flint. Lost countless times in the Playthrough 😅
Masara Town RGBY	What if the entire Pokemon franchise had ended after Generation 2(GSC)?
Coffeetoad	Where is CHOMP?!!!!!!!!
Zigsaw Gaming	Loves Turtwig wears Piplup cap
タイ人サヤマルット	*Thank you for picking up this wonderful Pokemon! As this year is the 10th Anniversary of Pokemon Platinum's Release...* *I, as a Thai Pokemon fan, truly love TORTERRA!!!*
King Doko	What about Togekiss 😭😭
Beth Smith	Torterra CARRIED my platinum run, tbf I was 8 so wasn't focusing on team comp but I used Torterra, Staraptor (swapped for Giratina later), Tentacruel, Golem, and then a random mix for the last 2 slots
Jason Dodds	Torterra isn't bad mystic I know people are entitled to their opinions but no one cares you dont like it
Roald Gaasbeek	Torterra is my most favorite starter pokemon ever!
Edwart Norton	I just begun my game a few days ago, currently team is: Grotle, Buizel, Gligar and Togepi and i wanna get a Croagunk. A good sp atk option for my six party pokemón?
Jay Conic	The team I used for Platinum was Torterra  Staraptor  Garchomp  Gallade Vaporeon  Houndoom
Iron Wolf Man	houndoom just doesnt learn good special moves until late :(
QuietStar silence	I always use floatzel instead of gyrados, i just like it best
roke tataroğlu	Torterra is one of the realest niggas
NightFly	Honestly, I love Infernape. My team would be:  1. Infernape 2. Luxray 5. Garchomp 4. Staraptor 5. Mega Lucario
Tempted Badger	5 ads on a 13 min video..
Lati 312	Did you cover all the HMs cut, Surf....
Italo Caycho Torres	The filler Pokemon could be Garchomp and honestly, it's not very hard to find.  A moveset should be  Dragon Claw Dig/Earthquake Fire Fang Slash/Crunch
Olly Tropics	My team for this team game was  Empoleon  Straraptor Misdreveus Toxicroak Lopunny  Luxuray
Vince Eggimann	TURTWIG IS GOD
Thomas Page	I used a Torterra during my own real run of Sinnoh (Diamond). I can’t know what the team was for sure (because the file got deleted) but based on a Battle Revolution team I still have, it should have been:  1) Torterra (Frenzy Plant, Cut, Leaf Storm, Earthquake) 2) Gastrodon (Water Pulse, Surf, Muddy  Water, Blizzard) 3) Drifblim (Psychic, Ominous Wind, Defog, Shadow Ball) 4) Luxray (Crunch, Thunder Fang, Scary Face, Discharge) 5) Starraptor (Close Combat, Fly, Brave Bird, Endeavor) 6) Bibarel (Strength, Rock Climb, Waterfall, Rock Smash)  I have no idea how I beat the game
Reaper of Things	Licklicky? The f*ck is that? I know every Pokemon in the Dex and I've never heard of that Pokemon, the only ones similar to it in name is Lickitung and Lickilicky, is this a Gen 8 spoiler?
Safal Muhammed	i love torterra more than infernape by a teensy bit
Ilija	Brick brick? U can't say break 😂
Elijah Toombs	Wouldn't return be better than takedown?
Tuvya Maeir	Staraptor doesn't learn Fly by level up...like...there is so much fact-checking in this video you should have done and it's really embarrassing. Forgetting to record something in audio and making up for it in editing is one thing. Forgetting to double check your facts and then trying to make up for them by saying "Whoops!" in the comments or something after it's uploaded? Come on, man...
Kevin Bibow	I would teach staraptor return instead of licklicky ^^
Nerdy Neko Girl	Can u do 1 for infernape
Night Zebra	As much as I like these. What about a team that only consists of pkm from said region, not including pkm like magikarp that can be found in every region.
Matthew Raley	torterra is my favorite starter of all time...
Nick den Toom	Since i don't like Doubling Up on weaknesses, i would replace Gyarados with Gastrodon and Houndoom with Luxray.
Champion DarkBlaze!	This was awesome! Torterra is my fav Sinnoh starter and in def gonna try this Team one day! But as for right now with the current playthrough Im doing of platinum, my team is: - Torterra  - Staraptor - Spiritomb  - Garchomp - Lucario - Magmortar The final four being Pokémon I’ve never used in an actual playthrough before. I’ve used all these Pokémon, but just not the final four in a platinum run. And this team has been great! Other members I used previously during this run were Floatzel, Luxray, Kricketune (hilarious in game cry and first time using one).
Nicholas Walleston	I mean, this team is alright. You could also give torterra a quick claw like any sane person would and teach it curse to be a physical wall. Also lickylicky is more of a slight physical attacker than special attacker. So if ice beam is going to be the main ice move besides ice fang on gyrados, well good luck with the nuclear attacker garchomp. Also I played diamond recently, and I had no problem making a team up. It's not "impossible" to make a team for sinnoh around torterra, I had brongzong with levitate, toxicroak with dry skin, clefable, milotic, and some flying type. But it isn't impossible because of one gallade and houndoom.
Mr Pokemon master	You need to start a new draft league to celebrate lets go games in the draft league you could use only original 151 Pokemon it would be awesome
Roger Ly	Just copy off chuggaaconroy‘ steam and you will be gold
keller blair	When will the inferape team be out
Peterson Byrd	You should include the stat trainers.  Marley  Mira Buck Riley Cheryl
James	Level 60 Gyarados - dragon dance, waterfall, ice fang + another move of your choice. Holding leftovers.  I swept Cynthia's entire team with that.
King Ping Bell	Just use Drifblim as your flier because you can just use stockpile and minimize then baton pass in battle to win easily, and then obviously use fly for the hm.
Owaim Azam	You are the best
CrazyGamer 101	I dont really lime sinnoh games
Haziq saiman	Tbf it's better if you replace lickilicky with magnezone
Turtlelochy Gamez	Its meant to be slow cause its a tortoise ( yes im captain obvious ) and its carrying a mountain oncit back, think about the struggles of his everyday life ;-;
Vasisht Srinivasan	My torterra team was: Torterra Weavile Rapidash Drapion Golduck Staraptor
El Carlos	I'd sooner put garbodor in my team than that pink abomination
Vled Hoccain	use M I L O T I C instead
mohit kalasuwa	Please do serperior edition, gen 5
Dalton Roe	gyarados is the real mvp because it can destroy cynthia's entire team. the moveset should be waterfall, dragon dance, earthquake, and ice fang. set up when spiritomb is out and after 6 dragon dances you can destroy her team.
Kinta02	Presumably another episode of bad choices, falsehoods and misinformation so lets go
G 92	Torterra's actually my favourite Sinnoh starter Key is to run Curse a few times, he'll tank like mental Yeah speed's an issue but to paraphrase the anime - "You're dealing with a defensive type", hence why Paul's was a beast and Ash's... well... wasn't
Brian Patino	Everything is cool and all, but uno to beat the game, u need TMs like cut, rock climb and rock smash
Hugh Jazz Hole	Guys, don’t use Take Down for Staraptor. Use STAB Return instead. Trust me, your Staraptor will be OP once you max out it’s friendship with you.
Zac	how in the fuck do you choose delphox over torterra
cheezywiz2	2 normal
Prajwal Dhule	I used lickylicky in platinum befor, and its reallyyyy good
EmperorOfTigers	Would have been nice if you offered a DP replacement for Gallade like you did on the Empoleon video.
devin johnson	I want to use this mega altaria in my rom hack with pixelite BUT MAN staraptor makes it hard to let go as my flyer.  His attack surpasses it being an early pokemon which are usually weak or blah
TKCool TV - Gaming and More	YES FINALLY
Killer Kirby	Sweet! you showed some love to my boi Lickilicky!
Abel Munoz	turtwig is one of my all-time favorite starter
Random Pokégamer	I love torterra!
Rcs493	I've never actually used Lickylicky before... Can't wait to try it out!
Star Spangled Gaming	If you had made the original best sinnoh team with Infernape use platinum pokemon like you did for this video how would it be different?
Pokemon maniac 33 Hillarious	Yay!! I predicted gyrados
Guy with no subscribers	The turtwig line is ugly
Silver Nicktendo 64	I'm thinking of getting Platinum again and making a new team for Infernape. How does this team sound? Infernape Floatzel Roserade Bronzong Garchomp Either Luxray or Dusknoir
Elizabeth Ingalls	I do like this team. It's different. And I love Houndoom.  One thing... how come most of the sets are purely attacking sets? No Toxic, Thunder Wave, Confuse Ray, Leech Seed etc? Those moves are so much fun. Everyone has different playing styles though, so I can't really fault that too much.  For Houndoom, its Attack is decent, but I'd stick with more Special moves. He can learn Sludge Bomb and SOLARBEAM. The latter requires set-up, but it's still pretty cool. Iron Tail is just not very good on it; it's not a very good move in general, and I'd personally only use it for STAB in gen 4. Thunder Fang isn't really strong enough imo, although it's good for the middle of the journey.  Torterra is good. It's just a physical tank. It gets Curse too, a decent set-up move that complements its stats pretty well.  No Swords Dance on Gallade?! Are you serious? At least you gave Gyarados Dragon Dance.  Lickilicky is one of my least favourite gen 4 Pokémon, but I actually liked its inclusion here. I like seeing less popular Pokémon being used in teams.
Jaden Storm	Saw lickilicki...and shut it off. Dude come on...wtf.
ChingChongChing DokiDoki	Hey Mystic how about Best Teams for Pokemon Colosseum and XD gale of darkness?
LilJoeFromKokomo	That Platinum remake better be done on the Switch!! I’ll give Nintendo all my money at that point!
sea dragon	Heres my team  Infernape Starraptor Gardevoir  Gyarados Bibarel or lickylicky Giratina
Sarah Gorrie	**sobs** torterra is my favourite...
iBenjamin1000	Lickilicky suggestion-swords dance (game corner) + brick break earthquake and normal STAB. Can get power whip by level up. Give it explosion (by level up I think) for a great big chuckle. Fire/thunder punch by one of the tutors you get before e4. You  could put surf instead of swords dance since you already have an attack booster
Ronald Rhodes	My boy lickilicky FINALLY got some recognition. Thank you so much 😭😭🤩🤩
Yahkov thegreat	Move set for Staraptor is trash. Better one would be Brave Bird, Return, Close Combat, U turn   Personally I would run EQ (over bite) on Gyarados and Night Slash (over EQ) on Gallade.   Lickilicki is just an odd choice. I would go with something cool like a porygon Z or eevee-lution of choice.
Jimmy nunya	I've never played gen 4. Really hoping they did a remake
Matthew Roberts	Lickilicky! Hallelujah! I love it som much 😍😍😍
atharv pande	Why not stone edge instead of rock spide
Super Luck	Close combat on two different pokemon , Crunch / bite on two different pokemon, and two flying AND normal types. Not a very balanced team overall . Platinum has such a wide variety of pokemon to choose from and you have repeating types and moves on this team which is unnecessary. A better teams comp would be: Torterra, Starraptor, Gallade, Houndoom, Rotom, Vaporeon. Less repeating weaknesses and more Stab coverage
blackdragonwtf	Are you going to do best teams for black and white 1&2?
sam kul	Remove lickylicky and add THE PERENNIAL SLAVE Bibarel can learn most HMS and if you tank him a little  he can take some hits in clutch situations .Best sack mon period.
Marcus Vinicius de Alvarenga	My Gen 4 Team: 1.Torterra 2.Lucario 3.Staraptor 4.Glaceon 5.Rotom 6.Floatzel
I b	All these are abt is just based off of Type/Type Advantages.
Safeena Rafeeqe	I
metagross9092	My team would be: Torterra, Togetic, Lucario, Magmortar, Electivire/Magnezone, and Floatzel
Lunatic fringe	No personally No liki,Gallade and why so much Dark move, Pokemon
The Legend27's Toxic Mailman	Use weaville it gets ice punch in Platinum
ashwin ajit	Why take down on staraptor?? Ever heard of return?
Master Brad	My team for Torterra is Torterra, Gyarados, Garchomp, Electivire, Staraptor and Lucario.
Harold Burton	How's Torterra the worst? With Rock Slide, it takes care of all four of its weaknesses.
SvelterGraph	Amazing video's keep it up 👍
Torterra gamer 101	TORTERRA IS THE BEST FULLY EVOLVED STARTER EVER  😤
Jaypom	yall better put explosion on lickilicky or im done
Dino World	My Team: Torterra Floatzel Drifblim Houndoom Drapion Jolteon  Shit I should have waited for this. I aint gonna reset and relive that slow-ass tutorial.
Jacob Ruby	Help? When you have a Torterra on your side, there ain't no way you need extra help. ~~Except ice types/moves. Those can melt in hfil~~
Tarlander	My team was 1.Torterra 2.Togekiss 3.Froslass 4.Flareon 5.Raichu 6.Golduck
Seth Walton	How about roost? Or Defog for starraptor? Normal stab truly isn’t that useful since brave bird is simply better (all types normal sucks on flying sucks on)
SplatoonAndPokemonFan54	WAHEY! Somebody else is a Piplup fan!!!
Henry Louie	Torterra Staraptor Gyarados Rampardos Houndoom Weavile
The Austin	Do Infernape Please and Thank You:)
Chasing Fish	U said "Link" would be in the description below but I couldn't find him. #LegendofZelda
Matthew Tardaguila	Just a tip, if you plan on using Gyarados. I wouldn't want to have a lvl 5 Magikarp as baggage for the first 3 Gyms, instead I would wait until Hearthome City to get a lvl 15+ Magikarp (so that it could atleast get Tackle) with the Good Rod found in the next route. This would make getting it to a Gyarados easier, having it fight in double battles and giving it an Exp. Share from Eterna City. And like the amount of trainers to fight around Hearthome (along with the Vs. Seeker) would give it more than enough exp to evolve and learn Bite for Fantina's gym. I'm a Sinnoh fanatic so I hope this helps :))
Alfonso Payan	Fuck take down get RETURN 100+ power
Nick Vallie	3:39 you have the wrong team up
Gaming with Golems	Staraptor brave bird, takedown, roost and steel wing/toxic, I find it good
HezBolt Productions	My team was torterra, staraptor, gallade, floatzel, houndoom, and luxray in platinum
Matthew Hecht	Before my game crashed I also had Gyrados and Staraptor.
LFuture	Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash
Steven Chen	Please make an Empoleon Edition. Since you already did it for Infernape. If you didn't know, Infernape and all beat the game easily. No others included.
Aries Hindman	my hall of fame team fir platinum is Torterra, Giratina, Lucario, Dusclops, Golduck, and Togetic
hbarudi	Suggestions: 1. on torterra, choose 1 of crunch or rock slide and for the last attack, choose worry seed. If they have levitate, use worry seed, then earthquake them on the next turn. 2. on staraptor, you can use giga impact (buyable tm) instead of take down and avoid recoil, and keep fly as the sole flying type damaging attack and use the next slot for defog hm. Close combat is a useful attack on this pokemon, but having gallade on your team can also let you consider another attack in this slot such as quick attack (always attack first), aerial ace (never miss), or agility (get more speed). Steel wing if you are ok with using single use tms on your pokemon. 3. Why leaf blade and earthquake on gallade since you have such type coverage on your starter? you can use x scissor for coverage on gallade which is a tm you can reobtain later in battle points. For the 4th attack, you can use slash, night slash, even false swipe to be able to catch pokemon and possibly hypnosis also for sleeping them and catching pokemon, but does not work if you used worry seed by your starter. 4. Houndoom, why physical attacks on him when the special attack is better than attack, instead do flamethrower, dark pulse, nasty plot, and sludge bomb or shadow ball. 5. Lickylicky or possibly just use Bibarel and give it the remaining hms you need. 6. For a water type, I don't like what magikarp evolves into. Pick another water type such as floatzel. Can teach it a water hm if you can't fit all your hms on the other pokemon such as bibarel. You can use waterfall on floatzel while bibarel can get surf, floatzel can learn ice fang and crunch, and you can give it the non buyable tm iron tail. After some analysis, it has come to be known that 2 types can hit the entire national dex including modern generations of pokemon either neutral damage or super effective. Those types are ghost and fighting, the same type as marshadow, this also applies to earlier generations since the 7th generation is the most type diverse generation and this condition still applies. But not for inversion battles in the newer games.
Deth Troy	my problem with torterra is not it's speed, but lack of grass options to back up it's great attack stat, it's special attack is a joke at 75, and there are only four grass moves to use with it's physical attack even to this day in gen 7,  and only one of those moves is gotten via level up Razor Leaf, the other moves are Wood Hammer (which requires a Heart Scale), Seed Bomb (Move Tutor), and Bullet Seed (which is only available in the gen 4 games as a TM), but why would you even bother with the last one, another problem is Platinum compared to D/P definitely makes things harder for this thing, since two gym leaders, Crasher Wake and Volkner have counter measures on their platinum teams to deal with it, when it should have an easy time taking on both.
Daniel Kean	Licki licki?   I'm fine with it but clefable is better
Koensko	Turtwig and torterra are my favourite starters so stfu😂
Chuck Pierce	I didn’t realize I was in such a minority, but Torterra is my favorite Sinnoh starter lol
Spedghetti Star	Speed speed speed. You know speed is NOT the most important stat. It doesn't define whether something is good or not. Ex. Magearna.
Johan Buis	Why would you use Iron Tail on Togekiss? Fairy type isn't a thing yet in gen IV
cool 23819	I actually like Torterra. I like its design. Also SPEED BOOSTING MOVES AND X SPEED PEOPLE!
Nathan Garcia	What about togepi, it can be a flyer
Tom The Boulder	Torterra is such a Cool Pokemon in both concept and Design,  But Opinions are Opinions so can't get to disappointed.
GreenE4	If I were to create a team with Torterra, this would be it: 1. Torterra 2. Staraptor 3. Electivire  4. Lucario 5. Milotic 6. Scizor
Awakeandalive1	I am completely indifferent to the Piplup line. I started out a hardcore Chimchar partisan, but then a Nuzlocke in which I let my ID# determine my starter got me to use Turtwig and gosh dang it if I don't love the little guy, for all his eventual weaknesses!
League of Anime	ty umbreon
89StevieC	3 best teams for sinnoh and no Luxray? I'm a little disappointed, really like that mon
Tejendra Chettri	Lol the way you say lickylicky is oddly satisfying and weird😂
BennyBoy46	Surfing the waters of Sinnoh on the back of a Lickilicky...  Majestic
DrMobianDoom	Don't worry Umbreon, Torterra is my least favorite starter too:)
Richard Lavariere	Leech Seed and Wood Hammer.
Jacob Lacey	FINALLY SOMEONE THAT LIKES LICKYLICKY!
Castrel Troy Madria	Where the other HM's that they can learn how do we complete the game then?
SpaceJam45	Land-Turtle... sir did you mean a TORTOISE!?
Y 7654321	9:55 kill me
Pedro Reis	Remake of the Infernape video baseade on Platinum would be terrific
Goompro Gameplay	I legit just started a new game of Diamond today and chose Turtwig. The coincidence lol.
Kaimana Lawrence	Way to keep cool mystic, and thanks for not burning, or icing  Torterra to hard (see what did there?).
Blong Blong Boi	I don’t agree with your opinion commit neck rope
Axel Kusanagi	Why does every starter need to be a sweeper? Sometimes you need a wall/tank.
Brandon Roberts	love these.
Jeffrey McMullens	you should teach lickilicky explosion that you can get in the veilstone city game corner you need to get to 10 bonus rounds in the clafairy game but if you can get it than use it on any pokemon and it will most likely go down it is just a good move to use if you are stuck on any part of the game and if you do not want to go thought the trouble than I still recommend it for other moves in the game corner like ice beam and thunderbolt.Also i recommend not wasting your money on coins because in my opinion sinnoh has the easiest game to get money
Infint	Aye, Mystic added Lickilicky, I don't understand why people hate it, it's one of my favourite normal type mons
EM11212	I'm playing Platinum for the first time right now. My team is  Torterra Staraptor Bibarel Luxray  Houndoom Bronzong (Heatproof)
Natalia Loureiro	Tortaras speed doesn't matter because defences are good 😊
blooddemon661	Do serperior next
Ur Boi	That’s a good team but I’d still make changes:  I’d rather teach Gallade Sword Dance over Eq. Why teach Gallade Eq when it has Close Combat and Psycho Cut? That coverage hits the exact same types except electric. It would be better to teach Eq to Gyarados so that it can beat the electric types that threaten it. Sword Dance in Gallade makes it insanely strong.  In place of Take Down, I’d give Staraptor Return. It’s better in every way. The only downside to it is that it depends on happiness/friendship so I’d wait before actually using the tm. I think you can check if happiness is maxed out by talking to the person in the house on the beach before Pastoria City. If it’s maxed then you will get a ribbon.  Not sure why you would even consider using Lickylicky. If you need a Surf user I recommend Vaporeon or Gastrodon. Then can also learn Ice Beam. They are both good since they are insanely bulky. Gastrodon might be the better choice because it has a better typing as it is part ground so its immune to electric. Plus it gets Recover at level 54.  To be honest, I’ve used Houndoom before in Platinum and I think that it’s pretty useless. Sure it beats Byron, Candice and Aaron, but so does Torterra, Staraptor and Gallade. The only reason you’re using it is for Lucian and in my experience Houndoom does badly against him. I find that it’s too slow and gets OHKOed by Focus Blast which every member of his team has. And even if he misses and you land a Dark Pulse, the damage isn’t that great and by the end of the turn you will be hoping that he misses the next Focus Blast. To replace it I would use Drapion. To be honest I’ve never actually used one in Platinum but I think that it would do better because it’s better for beating Lucian which is Houndoom’s only job. It has a better typing which leaves it with one weakness. It gets Crunch at level 49 and Toxic Spikes at level 28. But I don’t know how easy Skorupis are to find.  So if it were up to me the team would be:  Torterra - Earthquake, Woodhammer, Crunch/Curse, Rock Slide/Stone Edge/Curse  Staraptor - Brave Bird, Fly, Close Combat, Return/Quick Attack  Gyarados - Dragon Dance, Waterfall, Ice Fang, Earthquake   Gallade - Sword Dance, Psycho Cut, Close Combat, Leaf Blade  Gastrodon - Surf, Ice Beam, Recover, Toxic  Drapion - Toxic Spikes, Crunch and any 2 coverage moves of your choice.  Bibarel - Keep him as a Hm slave and swap him with Drapion when needed.
Benjix Bishop	One word: PORYGON-Z  Guys, he is unbeatable with hyper beam!
Duncan Donuts	A better Staraptor move set is Close combat, brave bird, return, U-turn (if u r playing on set)
Twiggy the Torterra	Well torterra is my favorite starter, and on top of that my favorite Pokémon
EagleBlue	Its LICKIlicky not LICKlicky You trigger my ocd every time you say it wrong
Jefferson Castro	My Platinum Team Torterra Staraptor  Houndoom Luxray Gallade  Floatzel
Gainsley Mc spice meat	Torterra is best if you disagree then you're entitled to your opinion
GD Joojmiguel	i swear the moveset you chose for staraptor was the one i used lol
Moises Gonzalez	My pokemon team for Torterra is Torterra  Staraptor  Magnezone Floatzel Frosslass  Garchamp.
Your Lord and Savior	Torterra is pure garbage. It’s grass typing is useless since if you go against a water type, it’ll obliterate you with an ice move. It’s use is literally only for facing rock / ground types, and for that purpose you’re better off going with a water type.
Tommy Marino	This will be my team: Torterra Mothim Glaceon Gastrodon Lopunny Togekiss
BlackStar	Instant like becuase its a team with torterra. Oh nvm u dont like him :c haha
char sage	I find it rather funny how he calls Torterra bad do to it's low stat speed there's pokemon in OU slower then Torterra or close to Torterra in speed.
TheJH1015	I'm SRing for a shiny Turtwig in platinum, and I'm planning on the following team, what do you think? - Torterra - Whiscash - Vespiquen - Drapion - Houndoom - Bronzong
Muhamad Karimo	Do a infernape
Neutral	I literally use Torterra every Sinnoh game, he's my favourite of the Sinnoh starters.
ShadowSamuel	I hope houndour will be available in gen 4 remakes. In Platinum I picked Chimchar, but in remake I plan to pick Turtwick.
Braeden. Inc	Wouldn’t return be better for Staraptor?
Nefarious Nektarios	Edit: *PICK UP A QUICK CLAW EARLY ON IN JUBILIFE CITY FOR TURTWIG* The team I most recently used: (3/4 times playing Platinum I've used Torterra, the 1/4 being Infernape) 1. Torterra 2. Staraptor 3. Vaporeon 4. Magmortar 5. Lucario 6. Electivire
Patrick Zieverink	Infernape (mach punch (lvl 14)/brick break (tm31 oreburgh gate after surf) , close Combat (lvl 36), flame wheel (lvl 21), punishment(lvl33 (move relearner)/swords dance)  Scizor ( X-scizzor (lvl 41), Iron head (lvl 53)/bullit punch(if technician), aerial ace (TM becomes a 90 move)), swords dance (lvl57) ) at route 210 (southern part at lvl 19-21 or northern at 27-29) or 215 (at 20-22)  Drapion (Poison fang (lvl 39) / Cross Poison (lvl 58), Crunch (lvl 49), Ice Fang (move relearner), Night Slash (lvl 38))  Can be caught in the swamp evolves at lvl 40 (use the look tower and see skorupi!)  Hippowdon (Ice Fang (move relearner), Yawn (lvl 13), Crunch (lvl 31), Earthquake(lvl 40)) Evolves at lvl 34. Found inside the cave at route 214 at lvl 22-23  Alakazam (Psychic (lvl 40), recover (lvl 30) , grass knot (TM 86) , SHOCKWAVE (TM route 215)) can be traided for a machop in orebourgh city  Gliscor (Aerial ace (TM, route 213), Roost (TM,  route 210 ), earthquake (TM), Sky Uppercut (level 45)) found at route 205 at lvl 16-18. Evolves when leveled up with razor fang held at night, which can be found at route 214  And some HM slaves. What do you think? Water coverage is low/absent but I do not think I need it due to ground coverage
James Maxx	My Platinum Team Torterra - Wood Hammer, Earthquake, Stone Edge, Crunch Houndoom - Flamethrower, Dark Pulse, Nasty Plot, SolarBeam Floatzel - Surf, Ice Beam, Crunch, Brick Break Staraptor - Fly, Return, Close Combat, U-turn Lucario - Aura Sphere, Dragon Pulse, Shadow Ball, Psychic Weavile - Ice Punch, Night Slash, Brick Break, Swords Dance
Neonlayers	Tbh it should have been let’s go clefairy instead of ever but ever is okay
Scott Bayley	I hope the unova videos don’t take long, I’ll be going through black and black 2 as my next Pokémon games. I’ve been planning potential teams and is curious to see what you’ll come up with!
Ivan Angeles	7:10 doesn’t Barry have Infernape?
Sayoroki	I was actually using a Torterra on my team before this came out and I want to share what my team is like and what I used to beat Platinum with.  Torterra: Miracle Seed  Wood Hammer Earthquake Curse Rock Slide  Luxray: Magnet  Thunder Fang Thunderbolt Crunch Iron Tail  Togekiss: Sky Plate  Aura Sphere Air Slash Fly Water Pulse  Vapeoreon: Mystic Water  Surf Ice Beam Shadow Ball  Toxic  Houndoom: Dread Plate  Flamethrower Dark Pulse Thunder Fang Sludge Bomb  Lucario: Fist Plate  Aura Sphere Flash Cannon Earthquake Ice Punch   That's the team I used. What do you think?
georgegeorgex	You almost made Torterra's half screen time spent being crossed out by a big red X. You don't like it we get it, but It's a funny subtle message... so gj.
Smack Jack	I’m happy you’ve shown Lickilicky some love by putting it on a team. Slurpee (my nickname for it) is an amazing Pokémon.
Trey Morrison	Torterra, Staraptor, Gallade, and Houndoom are excellent choices. Personally I would be using Vaporeon instead of Gyarados. Also, I would add either Froslass or Weavile. Ice is so underrated
The_Great_Rasputin	To be honest, Medicham is decent replacement for Gallade in Diamond and Pearl. It doesn't get a good physical Psychic STAB, but it's still pretty powerful with moves like Force Palm, Drain Punch, Rock Slide, and Psychic is a decent move on it.
John Lizzio	Again, why is there no garchomp?!?!?!?!
shadowedpast	Why leaf blade on Gallade? As opposed to coverage like night slash or pne of the elemental punches?
Juan Sebastian Florez Buitrago	Why do you put in narrys team the team he will have if you chosse empoleon with torterra
Dragonmist19X	"The Houndour family is one most underappreciated in the franchise" Yeah cause so many families got megas.
Jace Beckner	Why do you hate Torterra??
Gerjan De Zeeuw	I don't get how anyone can hate torterra, it is literaly a moving f*cking mountain ready to stomp your ass
Dragon Quest	My torterra team: Torterra Luxray Staraptor Machamp Vaporeon Drapion
Deadend36	Feels awful man. My favourite pokemon is Torterra
pwrsurg35	I personally like torterra. Its my favorite grass starter because of its typing. I usually dont like grass starters. It really does get very good moveset variety which is cool. Its main downside is the speed, but it doesnt bother me because I can put other pkmn on the team to cover that need.
Science Is Ma Thing	Why do you hate torterra?
BradPlaysGames	LICK-ee-LICK-ee the way you say lickilicky's name makes me really uncomfortable I can hear the spit in your mouth so stop it
Adrián Avila	And where can I get a licky licky or Lickitung??
Craig Campbell	Never played the DS games but torterra was my glazed starter my team was Torterra Electravire Charizard Hydreigon Aggron Gyardos all my pokemon intimidatin no puszies on my team
GATAZO	Actually, Gyarados doesn't get Crunch in Gen 4 Edit: My boy Lickylicky got some love yes! Edit: How is Iron Tail good for Cynthia's Togekiss lmao
TheMojoLemon	Torterrrrrrra
maguire bentz	I’d never ever user a licklicky
Emilio Camacho Erice	The biggest problem is his special defense or lack of it to be honest for something that is slow just like with emboar
Joey Grant	It's very easy to get Torterra by the time you fight Maylene and it absolutely destroys her Meditite and Lucario with Bite and EQ respectively.
TheMightyBlaze	What if speed effected accuracy
Aqua	This video is all I ever wanted.
Dragon Zek	Why tortera its trash do wish it never excited
Deth I am The LAw	I got a better idea: Don’t use Torterra
joshua primmer	LICKILICKI IS BEING USED!
Horatio786	Will you do this for Infernape?  I know you did one, but it includes Diamond and Pearl.
WishiWashi Gaming	Thank you
King Archie	Yesss
venomboy Wild	Yeeeeeeees I love torterra
Joleu	Where is Lurcario I have a moveset Aura sphere Dragon pulse Metal claw Fire,Thunder,Ice,Mega,punch
Vinicius Dancing	This is great!
Ben Maue	Where do you get Lickutung? I didn't see that in the video.
HylianAnime	Are you going to do Platinum for Infernape?
Not Spoiler At All	Wait, so people DO choose Turtwig as starter?
Dries de groot	Ah, I’m under 5k views... the satisfaction is real...
Snug Kieran	Yes!! I love turtwig 2 so thank you Mystic i luv your vids and i watch alot of them
GamerWatch Productions	if you do unova next I want to see serperior
Condor7215	As bad as torterra is in game, you have to admit it’s design is incredible
Mr E	For once a normal Pokémon that isn’t snorlax.
PlatinumWispa	Torterra is great though...
Mehmet Ali KOÇYİĞİT	Why no one uses gliscor ? It can OHKO all elite four and champion with swords dance + earthquake. And it is fun to use
Dinar El-Amin	I had such a horrible experience with Torterra in Platinum lol it's the reason I've never chosen a grass type starter again
Matthew Irons	My moveset for My Staraptor (My idea): Double Team - for evasion Close Combat - Very important Brave Bird Fly
Twi tch	YEAAAAAAAAAAAA
Cubzilla 123	Your team builders helped me for Omega Ruby and white and ultra sun👍
Harvey Coughlan	Oh dear
Θωμάς Νικολαίδης	No just NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fantasysaurus	My team was: Torterra  Staraptor Luxray  Gastrodon  Machamp Magmortor
KernowShinigamiViper Lil'Dragon	Have never used this starter. May look into breeding one at some point.
Yoda Date	Torterra is a badass starter Pokémon.
Gila6918	not first
ZimonZieClown	MysticUmbreon: You really need to work on your pronunciations of Pokémon names (e.g. Lickilicky, Gallade, etc.)
heh heh	Hey could you do worst team next when your done the great teams for the other starters
Akash 13	I giggled everytime you said lickillicky
Furretmon Gaming	Uh staraptor doesn't learn fly by level up😐
Nathan Warren	My team for platinum was torterra garchomp staraptor pidgeot  gardevoir and gyarados
Tu patrón	I would choose a water type from the generation not a old one, no Gyarados, please. At least Buizel evolved. I
Samuel Anderson	I would rather go for the blissey than licklicky
heated typhlosion	Typhlosion squad where you at
Everton Batista	I play Platinum right now so many pokémon for team
NeomG	Land turtle... you mean a tortoise?
Amanda Watkins	I hate you Tortara is great
Benny	If you’re up for it, you could remove Gallade and use Toxicroak. As for a replacement, that’s up to you, but I think it’d be a pretty alright Pokemon! For a move set, I recommend:  - Sludge Bomb -Close Combat / Cross Chop -X-Scissor  -Knock - Off
Mr. 1up	Wow, he really likes advertising them T-shirts lol
Alexander Evans	I respect your opinion, but I like turtwig and torterra
Audangas Kozmianas	Torterra is one of my favorite starters, how dare you say it's your least liked starter, now I'm not gonna like your video
Brawlerman 10	I played platinum last summer with this team  Torterra Infernape (Traded over, sorry) Gastrodon Drifblim Lucario Weavile
Thirdy Guy Productions	YES!! Finally   Hi there nice vid it's 3:04 AM here because I woke up at 1:53 AM And it's October 22,2018
gagers78	Personally I find houndoom hard to use in a playthrough due to it getting flamethrower late game and so it has to use fire fang for stab. I prefer using rapidash. I don't get why people say rapidash is so weak. It has a good stab attack in flame wheel from a low level and it has a good speed and attack.   My team would be: Torterra Staraptor Drapion   Gastrodon  Gardevoir Rapidash
Astaku Dreemarc	I'm about to play pokemon white 2, I thought of a team: Samurott Lopunny Lucario Crobat Arcanine Zoroark  Any thoughts and/or suggestions on moveset and/or replacements?
Dryden Joss	what's wrong with mega houndoom?
Akash	Thanks so much mystic
what up	Sup
Nicholas Batawui	Love Fourth gen playing it right now
Mawile #303	I still like my Role Play team of  Dawn as name character   Empoleon  Togekiss (Cynthia Egg) Lucario (Riley Egg) Glaceon (from the PC runner Bebe as Eevee) Garchomp because Pseudo Luxray simply because you need something else at the start
Fear the Pig Gaming	I will never defile a team involving my beloved Torterra with that pink abomination thank you for the suggestion but I will absolutely find a different filler lmao.
SurfingKyogre	Torterra is underrated tbh
Animelover445 Serrato	Your brave to do this
XannyFanta	Don't like how you're dissing torterra -_-
Virasman	I used:  Infernape - Flamethrower, Close combat, thunderpunch, earthquake. Togekiss - Aura sphere, air slash, fly, extreme speed. Luxray - Discharge, thunder fang, crunch, iron tail. Vaporeon - Surf, ice beam, acid armor, hydro pump. Gengar -Thunderbolt, Shadow ball, psychic, sludge bomb. Abomasnow - Wood hammer, ice shard, avalanche, brick break.
SteelTypeNULL	Man I love Houndoom, i didn't used Infernape in my first Platinum walkthrough just for make a slot for this hell hound
Shiny Arceus	Awesome video!
Kudo 108	I think lickylicky is cute :3
Max Oakley	I feel sorry for mystic for making a team for a slowass torterra
Bryson Beran	Your a poopy head
Devon RoseRed	What are some Pokemon I could use instead of the Platinum exclusives, I don't have Platinum
D B	Piplup is the worst for platinum. Chimchar is the best. Turtwig is the middle. I prefer medicham over gallade.
Don Slaughter420	I love Gen 4
Galaxy-Eyes Garchomp	I knew this was s co-op between you and 4thgengamer.
JStan96	Wouldn't Return be a better option on Staraptor than Take Down? It's more powerful, has better accuracy, and doesn't do any recoil damage. Plus there's more than 1 Return TM in Platinum so you can teach it to Lickylicky as well.
The Solao	Take down is useless on staraptor U-Turn is wayyyy better
Patrick Kennedy	This is a very well balanced team I like it
Kevin Murphy	I like Torterra....
Mal muffin	What about porygon
SAA AZI	I felt like Luxray or Electivire would be better in the place of lickylicky. Specialy Electivire
Joshua Shark	Infernape is my favorite Sinnoh starter.
Michael Anzulavich	I feel like Floatzel or Milotic is a better option of a Gyarados
Tasty Treats	@00:10 2spoopy5me
David Larkin	My prediction: Torterra, Staraptor, Houndoom, Gyarados, Jynx, Lucario   Edit 1: Return is also a very viable option for Staraptor, nearly as powerful as Take Down, but without the huge recoil. Edit 2: Thank you for showing Lickylicky some love! Edit 3:  4 out of 6 right, not bad!
Catherine Whittaker	Why Take Down on Staraptor? Return outclasses it - higher power at max friendship, no recoil, better accuracy, and you're given 2 Return TMs for free (with additional ones purchaseable in Veilstone).
CormacThunderStar	I'd switch Take Down for Return on Staraptor
Sofia	Use a Quick Claw on Torterra, it really helps.
TheGamerBros	Hi
super gespierde femke!!	Hi mystic my team fore tortarra is torterra starrapter vlochle gelaite hhundoom and glgliseon.
Jayden Ross	Turtwig is my favorite starter.. :{
Bear 0601	My first team in Platinum Torterra  Garchomp Gardevoir  Magmortar Scizor Machamp  If you want to you can rate this team but looking back at it I think maybe Golduck or Floatzel could have been better than Gardevoir.
Can we get 500 subs With bad content ?	7:50. Lol. I thought 99% you guys would pick Floatzel.  Because he makes up for torterras speed.  Otherwise,  for me personally its design over viability.  So Gastrodon it is.  Its slow but has the Hp it also has Ground so  It was my strategy against Bertha because Hippowdowns Sp.Def is its weak spot.  Torterra being a physical attacker, Gastrodon led the way.  With Ground it also doesnt have any effect with sandstorm.  Overall Gastrodon is good but I can see why gyarados is here.  Heck, 5/6 of my Pearl team are from sinnoh.  With the exception of course being Rapidash, but even in Platinum Houndoom, Camerupt, Torkoal, and Magcargo aren't native to Sinnoh either.
Javier Ramos	Allright time for me to go home to unnova cus that's what is next.
G.M Twins	Love you and your vids
typhlosion 787	use return instead of take down on staraptor you can get it at the game corner
Spartan Sid	Man...I have to be honest with y’all!!!  I FUCKING HATE EMPOLEON!!!! IT IS IN FACT, THE WORST SINNOH STARTER AND THE SECOND TO WORST WATER STARTER OUT OF ALL THE WATER STARTERS (NEXT TO SAMUROTT OF COURSE)  I mean sure it’s dual typing of Water/Steel is amazing and all but that’s as far as it can get!!!!  Reasons: 1.) It’s HP, Attack, and Defense stats all suck due to it ranging at the 80s and it’s speed is at a stupid 60!  2.) This Ugly penguin is NEITHER a tank NOR a glass cannon! Yes it’s Special Attack and Special Defense is good, however it gets OUTCLASSED by Vaporeon with acid armor and Goodra with the abilities Gooey and Hydration!  3.) Also I know it suppose to be based off of Napoleon and an Emperor; However, I feel a penguin pulling off that look is terrible! MAYBE if a MOUNTAIN LION 🦁 were to pull of that look, I’d consider it okay on my book! (And I think y’all can agree a mountain lion is better than a stupid penguin)  4.) It does a SHITTY JOB in the Sinnoh type play through!!! Having to only take down no more than two gym battles!!!  5.) Finally when you take a good look at its move sets, 90% of it is mainly water and normal moves having access to only one flying type move and about two steel type moves!  So yeah those are my reasons why I FUCKING HATE EMPOLEON!!!   Go ahead and trash my response to Empoleon but I’m NOT SORRY for saying that!!!  #empoleonsucksdick
Juho Autio	Gyarados can't learn crunch in gen 4, so earthquake or toxic can be in the set
Ricardo Melo	Please do Black and White next!
Bary Sanchez	When is the hg and ss coming for typhlision
Koolad	NOICE MYSTIC
Grandark Zephyrum	People talking about Torterra sweeping Bertha makes me cringe, as I tried that and my Torterra got one-shot by her Whiscash and Gliscor.
Nick Cruz	Gyarados can't learn Crunch in Gen 4. I would replace it with either Taunt, Thunder Wave, or Stone Edge.
JordanLovesLizards	You made a little mistake with Gyarados. Gyarados can't learn Crunch in Gen 4, so you need to replace it with another move.
osha wott	3:38 mistake 1 the starter right there -__-
Ruben lGomez	Yeah boiiiiii!
Spectral	The Lack of music in the beginning was creeping me out and making me feel uncomfortable.
PsychicBlizzard	Finally
Mike Sal	My team for torterra is  Torterra Staraptor Floatzel Froslass Bastiodon Toxicroak
Zack Likes To Ramble	Gyarados doesnt learn Crunch in Gen 4, it only got it in ORAS, also why waste your Earthquake TM on Gallade when you can give it to Gyarados for coverage
ARCangel	Holy crap! I love lickilicki Thank you for putting it on the team
Liam Flanagan	not first
MrKidKeeb	Can you do Decidueye for Ultra sun and Ultra moon?
_Dak_	TAKE DOWN on staraptor? why not return? it's much better in power and accuracy, doesn't have recoil, and you can get it at the beginning of the game too  also, Gyarados doesn't get crunch in platinum, didn't learn crunch until ORAS, stupid i know
joinmarch76	Eh, I stand by what I said some time ago: Torterra speed is SUPPOSED to be slow. And given how it holds an entire mountain on its back, I don't blame it for being sluggish.
Tuxedo Banana	Man already under 60 comments?
Koala Fontnite	It's not that bad as a pokemon
PVSM1 6731	Gyarados couldn't learn Crunch by level up in Gen 4, so keep Bite on Gyarados.
