Noah Wessels	How is umtiti?
Joe Walker	Opinions on erikson
MADiR FC	If you do another one of these ...AZPILICUETA !.. I would like your opinion
Omar Chihani	What about lala in rb?
Klaus Hermann	guys, i need your help! how would you enhance that team: lloris - walker, vandijk, sanchez, mendy - lucas, kante, pogba, hazard - aguero - lukaku. its a 4-4-1-1 atm but that could be changed obviously... i thought about swap mbappe in for lucas.. but i'd prefer a left footed player on the right wing.. so mybe salah, but i'm not too convinced by him. bale would be perfect, but its impossible to include him chemistry wise...
ER7Sport	Would matuidi naingolan and modric on a midfield be good for futchamps got gold 3 so I want to get gold 2 this week and if everything goes well gold 1

BounceHub	go out and see sunlight nerd
arglc	Alex Telles at LB. Easy to link too.
Adam Fogus	That inform Ben Yedder is absolutely insane. I have him as my striker between Bale and OTW Promes. That attack just shreds people apart, and Ben Yedder just never misses the target for me. with Isco, Modric and Casemiro/Kroos to feed them, and varane, ramos, alba, carvajal and courtois to save their rare mistakes, its a stacked team.
Declan Murphy	Promes ???
TheLonelyGod	SIF LALA AT RB

Vasili	Is matuidi good???
Luke Jackson	Matudi or Fernandinho
Brian Murray	Oblak is the best keeper in the game de gea is shocking

Football Fumb	This has to be one of the worse `best players` video. Gorilla is the worse reviewer, because he has not used these players` ; or played against them. This is a virtual re-hash of his Fifa 18 video. Basically everyone, just save up and only play with Icons = done.
steve spark	i have used 89 gerrard he is unbelievable
Miku	‚ù§Ô∏è
Sir Dello	Sum of us can't afford a neymar lol barely a 50k player but thanks tho. So a video just cheaper options üòÇüòÇ

crazypearce	IF mahrez is my favorite right cam this year. he has good dribbling and agility, and good finishing and curse. i love cutting in and scoring finesse shots with him
Melosivitch24	Szczesny still the best keeper on the game... used courtois de gea Alisson all of them and every time I move back to szczesny because he pulls off the most ridiculous unrealistic saves

Michael van Voorthuizen	What do you think about koulibaly?
Pace	Thoughts on 91 Ronaldinho? i can't decide if its better to play him cam or st
navidh89 _	BEN YEDDER IS OP AS HELL!!! buy him ..I've got him he's so good cause of his 91 jumping he can hold his own against 6ft plus defenders ..I would only replace him for a legend ..that's how good I think he is
Mauricio Berlanga	Alejandro Gomez is a 10k Messi... seriously, try him out. I have a team worth 2-3m and still play him.  Also Perisic is like a cheap CR7, he is amazing at ST/CF with Hunter, fast, 5*WF 4*Skills, great heading + jumping, strong, great shooting, etc.
DZ Cast	thanks for the video no one has made one like this as far as i know i've been searching for a video like this for ages

Iamstavros Tube	What about 87 sane?
Slungel Deluxe	Dunno Gorilla... I HATE Allisson
Mohamed Bmb	The problem is Gorilla's only suggesting players, most of them he didn't even try.. imo: GK=86 Szcezny & Alisson RB=Florenzi is a fucking beast CB=Van Dijk and Chiellini(Best gold CB) CDM=tried Fabinho, Nainggolan, Matuidi, Kondogbia.. However, No one is half as good as Allan CAM=POTM Hazard - Fekir - Mertens ST=Lewandowski(Best gold ST in game hands down)

Keaton Ramey	IF Felipe Anderson has been unreal for me his height looks too low but trust me hes awesome. Also IF Joshua King has been good for me. Another one is Otamendi, I got him untradeable so ive been using him all the time and he's been great for me.
