the rooster	Check out the confessional testimony of Billy jack Haynes. The boys on the tracks
Jason Anthony Scott	Yes i love America and want America to have the best and the best his mr Barack Obama and the people that want America be the greatest place for all person that love America
Nancy Charest	Goosebumps and tears for me too.  We've come a long way since my high school guidance counselor told me (falsely) that women couldn't be air traffic controllers.  Bless these candidates,, every one and VOTE!
Kevin Charles	Do these women want a pat on the back for doing their jobs while being a woman?  No wonder Trump got all the womens votes. Ridiculous gender-bating ads like this that left rational thinking women running to the Republican party
Friscotxman	Semper Fi..... VOTE  Serve America......I did Serve and Do VOTE!
truthseeker42 42	Not one, NOT ONE Republican woman was featured in this video. I hope to GOD that everyone of these women lose. Just  another George Soros SCAM !!!! You want HIGH TAXES and more unemployment then ever before?? DO you want GLOBALISM IN AMERICA??? How does open borders sound with Muslim rape gangs and Sharia Law?? How about REAL terrorist acts killing thousands instead of the 13 like that a Liberal nutjob just did in that PA Jewish Church!!! Better wake up people. It is time to set America back on the right track... VOTE REPUBLICAN !!!!
Some One	You rose late, the white man's days are coming to an end. Next is the Spanish man's reign if it makes that far. Will they let women surpass them, never,!
Gail Flackett	brilliant!!
Cristina Esposito	As a Naval Academy graduate, I had goosebumps watching this video.  Couldn't be prouder of the difference these women are making.  Thank you for your continued service!
Heather Wetzler	Love THIS!!!
Cue Career	Aweosme!!!
benjiboiiii	These women r cool as fuq
Virginia Kallianes	This is reminding me of the early 1980s when we activists were working to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, and opponents screeched that it would force women to be drafted, force women into combat positions, etc. Of course, servicewomen were already serving in often dangerous settings, and we pointed out that prohibiting them from combat positions often prevented them from moving up the ranks & achieving higher level positions. I'd argue that these women illustrate the benefit of having those opportunities to take leadership...in the military, in their communities, and, now, in running for office.
Chris Murphy	GO! Thank you for running!
Alexander Wood	Hats off to all these women who have served our country, and to Seth Moulton for his leadership  in getting this video produced. Hope you are all standing together at the swearing in of the next Congress.
Paul Borst	*All democrats who got into power with affirmative action.  It's easy to artificially inflate your resume when you don't have to earn it.*
Ben Wasserman	Now THIS is an inspiring political commercial
Max Power	Isn't the size of government big enough without their fat asses waddling in? I have a difficult time believing any of these heifers have been airborne.
Robert Kandel	Share this video and follow the candidates advice:  VOTE !
1amppersec	I unfortunately served with one of these women.  She did nothing to empower women and in fact she cried any time a senior officer provided her feedback.  As a fellow servicewoman, I could never vote for her - especially since she attempted to put me down many times so she could look better.  Oh wait, isn’t that what politicians do best?  Just because you serve in the military, it doesn’t mean you are a decent person.
rich pasto	Guessing none of these candidates are "in this" looking to finance a second home #suckitTedCruz  Do work! Go get'em.
SilverStar830	Sleazebag Creepy Porn Lawyer deadbeat Michael Avenatti endorsed this video on his Twitter, and he's soliciting "donations" for "actblue". He has multiple multimillion dollar judgements against him, and his infamous p0rn actress client is losing BIGLY, too. Anyone and everyone who still abides in that greazy charlatan deserves the incredible disappoint they are most surely going to get.
snipz127	Vote for conservative women
D'yer Maker	The democrat party is the party of crime, batshit craziness and crying babies.  Vote RED.
Edmund Singleton	Have you seen that ‘Serve America’ political ad, featuring all those professional women running for public office for the first time, who, because of cultural constrains must dye their hair to be accepted, yes baby, you have not really come a long way, at least not yet, in short… have not fully arrived…must stop dying your hair…
Geraldine Brooks	And Bruce gave the music for free.
Steve George	As a veteran, I weep over the current state of our country and our leadership -- these strong women give me hope for the future God bless you all and best of luck
Levanszarva Mégaszaris	Küche, Kinder, Kirche!
Mi Si	WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!  ..... but I agree with pixxer1 .... we need to see the NAMES and states/districts where these candidates are each time they speak.  It goes by too quickly right at the end.   Thank you for a bright spark of hope in a bleak political landscape.
Greg Woolley	True American Heroes
Tom T	Honest question - Are any of these women Republicans?
BobbyPeru	#VOTE
Alain salanova	Bon avec ces brêles à al noix vosu êtes mal barrés les gars !!mdr
Angus Mac	Why would it be considered virtuous to have participated in illegal military actions against innocent people living in other countries in order to maintain America's corporate dominance? The fact is,  the rest of the world views US military interference in quite a different way than many Americans do. Ask the people who lives have been destroyed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Vietnam, etc.  I'm sure there are plenty of women out there who work to improve the world; who build homes for the homeless, build schools, teach people to read, dig wells for clean drinking water, care for children, organize workers, etc. Those are the women that should be celebrated and encouraged to run for office.
Kurt Bond	I haven't been more proud of my service to my country and of everything I hold dear about this country I love for two years but I am misty eyed right now.
Alex Huang	echo chamber.
Angel Emerald	Vote Democratic Nov 6, 2018.
Emily Walter	Where are all the black women who are running for office? http://database.blackwomeninpolitics.com/

Pamela Heiligenthal	I am so proud of these women. Go kick some butt!

spikealee Baker	Thank you for you service ladies!  You've got my vote!!!!

James Carter	I was on stationed on the USS Harry S Truman back in 2002
Pam Wright	THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  (You make me proud!)
Jack Leon	People like this make me feel better about our future as a country
The Perfect Autumn	Go get 'em, Girls!!
scoopablecatlitter	The eight women who served in the U.S. Navy, Marines Corps, Air Force, and CIA–Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria from Virginia, Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania, Gina Ortiz Jones and MJ Hegar from Texas, Amy McGrath from Kentucky, Mikie Sherrill from New Jersey, and Elissa Slotkin from Michigan
Skip Shaputnic	Right on Sisters (and brothers) This is awesome!
Mark Dodel	In Monroe County Pennsylvania we have Claudette Williams who served 30 years in the US Army and retired as a Sgt Major after tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan running for State Representative. While she was wounded in combat, who'd have thought she'd be attacked by local Republicans, saying she can't serve in the legislature "because she has PTSD". She has been chased off of properties because she is black. She actually has accomplished things unlike the do nothing Republidrone she is running against. Her web site https://claudetteforthepeople.com
Robb Kushner	WOW! Just WOW! I hope they ALL win!
Monty Seitz	serveamericapac.com:  Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria from Virginia, Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania, Gina Ortiz Jones and MJ Hegar from Texas, Amy McGrath from Kentucky, Mikie Sherrill from New Jersey, and Elissa Slotkin from Michigan

מעיין פלג	Sarah's fans?😍
Tessa J. Wright	How come none of them are running as republicans? Or is it that propaganda videos such as these simply do not promote conservatives like they promote liberals and socialists. I guess it is only empowering if you run for the "right" party and stick to the "right" ideology. Otherwise you're deemed "race traitors" "gender traitors" etc...very telling how biased and one way street our politics have become. Shame.
MsRebecca2000	A big thank you to Rachel for sharing this on her show tonight! It’s such an inspiring message, and so empowering for women, both young and old!

ErynRenee	This is just incredible. This video gave me goosebumps.
Paycho	What a diverse bunch of white women ready to murder brown people! So brave!
hampelli	Oh, how I wish they had included  Kristin Collum, Democratic candidate for Idaho's Lt. Governor and former member of U.S. Army (includes serving as platoon leader in Signal Battalion of the 25th Infantry Division, special assignments in NATO School (SHAPE), Oberammergau, and working as personal staff for General Colin Powell.)
Joe Human	YES. More women like this running for office, please. More women like this running the WORLD, please.
Tim C2007	Thanks Bruce for allowing your music helping to bring attention to this video.
Leftist at the Party	So what policies are they bringing to the table? Will they try to cut our inflated military budget and actually stop the wars we are in?
trackhorse	All Democrats, one hopes
Mike Halsey	After turning down millions from Chevy, Microsoft and dozens of others, Springsteen finally lets a song be used in a commercial.
Patrissha Patrissha	Kowalski for "The Students of Las Virgenes Unified School District (California)
barakah856	LOVE all these strong, smart DEMOCRATIC women who proudly served their country and want to continue to serve!
pixxer1	You could be helpful to these women by writing their names and district numbers below the video. My only complaint about this otherwise excellent video is that they go by so fast at the end that someone in their district who was unaware of them would not have time to notice the information.
aanthony48	This is so great! Each of these women clearly have a compelling story worth finding out more about.
Matt Witman	I'm lolling
Frank A.	This an incredible, inspirational video.  I am of the belief that we need more women elected to public office to reflect and promote interests that may differ from male politicians.  These women rock!
Gregg Chadwick	Stunning!
Riley McGovern	Nice vid Mrs. David
supplementourlives5	I love this so much. Love you ladies so much. Thank you for running. I'm canvassing for Abigail! :) Let's do this thing!
GenesisQuest	Go girls. Time to take our country back from this bunch of criminals who have seized power with Russian help and through gerrymandering, and forced their hateful minority policies on we, the majority.
Todd Duvall	This video gives me goose bumps. I love it. When I was in the Navy women weren’t even in combat roles. Now to see them as former combat veterans and running for public office gives me such a sense of pride and patriotism. In the immortal words of Lee Greenwood, “I’m proud to be an American...”
Christina Wallace	Yess!!!! GO Elissa Slotkin and ALL of these incredible women. I can't wait for you to serve our country in DC!
Cindy Gallop	I can't stop watching this. This is inspirational on so many levels. Women, do this in EVERY area, not just public office. You serve us all by leading us.
Jennifer Gangi	so inspiring! I am writing postcards via Postcards for Virginia for Abigail Spanberger's race.
Jane Condon	Love them all. Country first, ahead of party. These women have served for us. Let's help them now!
Kathleen Warnock	Love this!
TheUrszulat	Brilliant women. May every one of you succeed.
Cathy McGuinness	So impressed by these inspiring women. I'm really looking forward to a government more representative of our country's population, which is more than half women!
