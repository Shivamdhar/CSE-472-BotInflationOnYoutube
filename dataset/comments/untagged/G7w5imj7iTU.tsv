Pynky II	You are trying to destroy their culture....what if they told you to stop referring to Gentiles as goyim?
Gem Girlla	WTF?
Virginia Davila	nice going
Jack h	Oh,  and Pizzagate is fake right?
Gracie Golden	Go, Swann, go.  Don't like corkscrew at all, and I am a Tennessean.  Saw a video some years ago regarding children in the middle east being used as jockeys for camel races, and as well being sexually abused by men.  It's so damn sickening what goes on all over the world involving children.
Ipso Facto	Everyone on Capital Hill has child sex slaves. The FBI and NYPD have video of Hillary Clinton raping and murdering toddlers and then dinning on the flesh. Hardcore NYC police officers who have seen it all were brought to tears by what they saw these animals do to children. That's why they keep funding the pedophiles, because *THEY ARE* murderous pedophiles.
David Gendron	What's that world
dividing and conquering	Meh, money !
Tim Cantrell	"It's part of their culture" We're destroying hashish while allowing opium. What complete madness US Foreign Policy is. 17 years after 9/11 we're supporting Al Quada in Syria !
Hey Man	Evil here evil there these motherfuckers in charge don't give a fuck about me,you or those children, so long as there oligarchs  collect allllll.
BlackEagle	@3:30 ummmmm......  Unachievable Standard???.....  Stopping boys from being sodomized??....  As Q said, "You have no idea how bad thing really are".  This shit is sick these people need to be HUNG for their fucking crimes and I don't care if they're in bum fuck Egypt. We hanged Saddam publicly, we can hang mother fucking pedos in America and abroad.  Show them no quarter. Heresy is a crime for a reason.
assault and battery	What about the Catholic 'church', and the English 'Royal family'?  Both those institutions abuse young boys and girls and murder them and drink their blood. How come it's different for Afghani's?
Killjoy Prepper	And you people vote for the trash that supports and funds the worst acts imaginable ...by proxy through your vote and taxation you are rapist and pedophiles !!!
harry viking	there are too many pedos in power in the US! they must be flushed out and hanged!!
tony torres	Just like ancient rome..royal families like wahhabies...the  pedifiles have taken over..the pentgon..c.i.a. closet gay men..especily in republican party are full of secret closeted gay men..and protected pedafiles.like.like dennis haster...hope I got the name right..
dipasasky	Our politicians  are pedophiles themselves . That is why # PIZZAGATE was ridiculed and denounced .  They want pedophilia to be legalized. This doesn't bother them . Just as long as the poppy fields keep producing high grade heroin . Disgusting !
satrac	Sick people. please withdraw support.
Ludicium Veri	The war machine is compartmentalized human trafficking. Todays heroes are criminals.
charlielondon72	THEY ARE FLOODING EUROPE WITH THESE ANIMALS THIS IS SO SICK
LegacyEvoAce	Well considering the U.S spends trillions slaughtering tens of millions through out the whole world,  several billion to help rape some kids is not a lot.(both in terms of evil or money) In the great words of Anderson Silva ‚ÄòIs normal‚Äô.
Will R.C.	Are you kidding me?  How could Our Congress support such a DISGUSTING PRACTICE. ?? This is not why our troops are fighting and dying in Afganistan.
inga robinson	Muslims are all homosexuals because they believe as long as they do it to young boys its Ok , yet they murder everyone that engages in adult homosexuality , how perverse is that ?!
Peter Wexler	Heh, heh, heh: The "Dancing Boys" of Afghanistan.
Travis Norseman	Senator Menendez just got off for his sex crimes and now he's defending foreign sex criminals. No surprise. Corker can rot in hell with him.
truthseeker 88	Ya most of our government supports this kind of behavior that's why they do nothing but give them billions that they steal from us! We have very sick and twisted people running this country!
Amy Robert	Of course sexually abused children won't be defended by members of the american government. They are guilty of this evil as well. American tax payer dollars fund human trafficking globally.
I's On U2b	*BLIND EYE* üëÅ Turning a blind eye to this modern day medieval savagery reveals that something of greater value to the controlling players in that sickening part of the world ‚Äîand ANYWHERE ELSE it's taking place‚Äî is being covered up and exploited: heroin poppy cash crops; human trafficking; emeralds; oil; gold; silver; etc. O'Keefe the slave owners and adult former slaves. Free your mind. Free the slaves.
Bob Spelledeitherway	HR604   ask your representative, have they signed it. if not ask why
Johnny Aingel	Pakistan too not just Afghanistan from what i heard on youtube and thank you ben swann
Grant Keller	Apparently it doesn't bother Americans at all, as taxpayers fund and support other countries that bomb/KILL children just for their land/resources...
D Mac	You and the Venom symbiote would work well together.
Mohsen Bazargan	CH in Bacha bazi pronaunce like CH in Cheap. 'baCHa' = 'CHeap'
Cocoa	This is not only happening in Afg. but also in Iraq. I remember reading an article about US soldiers raping children in front of their mothers during 2003 invasion, and still imprisoned children in the northern part of the country.
Ethan	I hate to say it but I'm betting half our senators have no moral qualms against the molestation of children. I also find it somewhat ironic too that homosexuals are killed under Islam, yet sexually assaulting little boys is jussssst fine. Disgusting.  Opium, Oil  and military profits that's why we're  "there" and will continue to be.
TheKeithvidz	America is a pederast capital itself. Pizzagate got Swann fired. A wonder it blocked?
Robert Craighead	Thank you for uploading.
Say_When	Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney asked the same question to Rumsfeld before being kicked out of congress. But Senator Menendez who slept with child prostitutes in the Dominican Republic remains in government...
Scott Leisman	in a culture where `its not a sin unless you love the boy`, there is nothing you can do for a country like that.
Nigel Lopez	Thank you so much for covering this disgusting situation. I so wish someone would give you a job on a major news network.
Jordan Cotter	Stop giving our tax dollars to Afghan forces. Full stop.
chickendinner2012	Vote out Neocons and warmongers and the world will be a much more peaceful place.
Ender41948 H	Ben is an excellent example of a true journalist.  Too bad he's in the minority nowadays.
amommamust	Thank you Ben, and Dr. Paul.
Eric Conners	Mr Swann your amazing keep up the great work
G	MORE VIDEOS BEN
AKSBSU	Wingnut fundamentalist loons in Middle Eastern countries have publicly executed citizens for sorcery, witchcraft, and apostasy, but THIS SHIT is happening.
Joshua Rogers Sr.	A greasy scumbag pedo hit thumbs down....   That shit stain just made it to the list...
jas57264	Corker sounds like a Deep State operator.  Time to deem him a terrorist and provide him a free ticket to Gitmo???  In for a Penny in for a Pound Bob.  WWG1WGA
Caroline Thomas	I am so ready to never pay tax dollars again in this country until we get completed transparency.
Psy Hun	Does anyone else think NATO alliance members may also have partaken in these customs? Usually in times of war there are sexual crimes committed by the invaders. I think its folly to assume its only afghans doing this. Internationally these crimes are covered up in high places. Its utter shite that you can get the whole world subjugated to Global Satanists and communists yet a global understanding or consensus as to what is right and what is wrong is unattainable.
Edwin Reyes	Who the f thumbed this video down? You better stay in hiding if you know what‚Äôs good for you.... üò°
911mindsnatchers322	I reported on this 2 yrs ago.  But nothing is being done about it and in fact it's hush hush because the politicians want that poppy money and they want those poppy police (US MARINES) to stay there to manage the growers.  The PTSD soldiers have in Afghanistan, specifically, are not from armed conflicts but from trying to sleep while a 12 yr old is screaming from being raped next door by an afghan soldier, and the US marines are ordered not to do anything about it.  YEAH
Dustin Marquis	one guy who disliked this video works in US military...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...
Richard Rivera	You wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from Senator Men√©ndez, a man who went to the Dominican Republic üá©üá¥ to have sex with young under age prostitudes. Why is he not in jail?
Independents unite	All an "islamic' problem except when it is a "catholic" problem, or a "parliament" problem, or a world "elitist" problem. The culture is rampant because those in the world that enforce the laws are corrupt unaccountable psychopaths that participate, or 'look the other way' for their own political power/$.
James Valenti	I had a feeling the death of that journalist was a distraction.
Aussie2u	It must be so difficult for Rand Paul to watch this network of senators who won't dare upset the existing funding apple cart.  Rand crafts various amendments and bills to try to change this "status quo" and almost every time he gets stomped on and made to look like a kooky fool with idealistic visions.
Kathy H	Stop funding pedophiles!!!  I don‚Äôt care what their ‚Äúcustoms‚Äù are!! They are allowed to abuse children as a right????  Appalling!! STOP ALL FUNDING to them
JCP Irish	‚ÄúSome cultures are better than others!‚Äù
Zachary Thomas	Stop providing money for security forces full stop.
RebelRadius	I thought that Trump was all out to get human traffickers and child sex crimes.  Interesting enough, there are thousands of trafficked people approaching the borders as we speak.  Of course this funding should be on hold, but more so the funding of charities and foundations.
shiny penny	No surprise with Menendez he has been flying to Dom.Rep. to have sex with little girls for years....
Maximus Wolfe	All child molesters should be killed without exception. Your taxpayer dollars hard at work making sure that they are given free rein to horribly destroy the lives of countless children.
April Rain	Once again Ben you are a Hero for speaking about these atrosoties . May God Almighty protect you always. This will not stop friends, not as long as we live in this fallen world. But, speaking out and against this abuse is something.
RedMage	They fund them because some of them want access to these kids too. Our leaders are sick people.
Ron Ondechek	I pray for those poor children.  What kind of a person does this to a child?
Jon Egelston	So... worst case scenario is we take away their funding??? Ummm....how about we kill these motherfuckers for starters!
Morningflower J.	Agree completely. I don't want any of my money given to them. We also have let these people in our country that still do these disgusting and shameful acts.
pradachik	This has been a big issue and so disgusting.
a crusty krab	Damn that is really horrible.
44R0N	GREAT VIDEO! Liked. Commented on. Tweeted.
Tracey M	Again with clumping homosexuality with pedophilia as an issue of preference or culture. What is with these people? More importantly why does anyone support a politician or anyone for that matter who makes these claims? Children do not have any choice in these matters, particularly when they are actually CHAINED!! Grotesque to say the least and not the first, second or third time this has come out with little to no outcry from supposed advocacy groups on human rights. Thank you Ben for continuing to shed light on this and on those who turn a blind eye.
Rose Riker	Both Corker and Menendez should be chained to a bed and used as sex slaves!
Nobody Matters	This makes me sick. Why can't humans do the right thing? This ain't right, stop hurting children.
Paul Stoddart	Listen to Kay Griggs on YouTube. On our own with iSrael doing some Krazy things
Delta Johnson	In the USA you will loose school funding if you are caught in possession of marajuana but in foreign nations US tax dollars are spent to keep militants in power despite human trafficking and child victimization? Seriously, wtf?!
Monica Swavel	Exactly right!
Bobby Robertson	The pentagon is full of Pedophiles. Hundreds are caught downloading child porn and nothing happens. My sons will never step foot in a Catholic Church or military recruiting office If I do my job right
Michael H	If these were little girls being violated in this way, much of the world would be screaming foul. Since these are boys, few care.
JAGKY	Rand Paul ROCKS.
Wade Page	We The People must STAND UP as one and insist these barbaric crimes against children are NO LONGER FUNDED by OUR tax dollars OR by OUR COUNTRY!
Scott Ross	Brought to you by the same flagrant hypocrites who supported "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue" and for whom CONSENSUAL relations between ADULT members of the same gender are utterly repulsive.
AndTheCorrectAnswerIs	I wish we would just pull out of the Middle East COMPLETELY and stop sending ALL foreign aid to ANY other country. US taxpayer's money should be used in the USA...not spent on other nations. We have trillions in infrastructure that needs rebuilt. We have a porous Southern border that needs a wall. We have poor that need good jobs. We have innovative businesses that could use gov't funded R&D and incentives. Someone needs to fix the potholes in my local streets, and make sure Flint Michigan has clean water.
Aint1S	That's is disgusting AF! One red one blue, these two Bob's are couple of fools, we don't need to support these nasty bastards... What do they do to the boys when they grow up knowing that our country and people by extension caused this to them. Would they become what we don't want them to become or are they allowed to grow up?! Those people don't need our money, I don't care what they do for our country... That kind of money isn't something a douchebag could ever earn. They can be replaced by any *normal* individual who's not absolutely evil AF.  How come the evening news isn't reporting this story, they love suffering and people need to hear it!
Chris Vale	Dyncorp standard procedure
TRUST CHRIST OR GO TO HELL	Antichrist USA US Gay
ColoradoFLgrl	ü§Ø
Ab-Dhul Alif Qadr Muhammad	Thank you Ben. It is disgusting to know that U.S. Senators obviously agree with baby raping under the guise of it being "cultural".  If this is the case, then why not support the narcotics cartels of Columbia, Uruguay, Cambodia, and in the local urban areas in America? It is preposterous to not support Senator Paul in his efforts.
Gil D	Its cultural matter...you can not change other country culture by force.. they are primitive,barbarian ppl & thats that
LarryC213	We should NOT be there at all. It is all insanity. If we have a real reason to actually go to war with any nation, then we should kill them and blow up all of their things...then we should go the hell home. But what do we do, we stay and completely rebuild their entire nation. We order American special forces troops to train them, we then equip them with guns and ammunition. And oftentimes, those same people that we train and equip, then kill American servicemen and women. This is a culture that is so far removed from absolutely anything that we can imagine. Stop the insanity. Stop playing the role of an empire that is bent on ruling the entire planet. Go back to being a Constitutional republic. Rebuild our own nation.
Streetslogic	Completely sick & utterly disgusting. However pedophilia is quite the norm for so called Elite's.. DC, Hollywood, London, Rome.. it's as ordinary as watching a baseball game for them..
damnright4	Billions of dollars? Why not stop funding all together to Afghan forces period, guilty or not......
Peaceful Warrior	Wtf. Thank you Ben
Kathleen Hernandez	US tax dollars funding sex slaves coming up on two decades in Afghanistan ü§î
Keith Croes	Thank you for throwing light on this issue. It's amazing that America excuses this as a "cultural issue." Yes, it may be a cultural issue; but our foreign policy should be guided by OUR cultural values, which should absolutely oppose cultural values that accept such abhorrent behavior.
Brian Anderson	This = blackmail ops = PIZZAGATE/ PEDOGATE. This is how the "Establishment" grows and keeps its influence.
Zack Osborn	Senator Bob Corker feels stopping child trafficking and sexual slavery is insurmountable, but destabilizing the entire region and wiping out their ruling class and replacing it with Wahhabist extremists is somehow easily achievable? Let me guess, the more achievable of the two uses mass tax-funded military industrial complex spending to solve?
Vierotchka	It is pronounced "batcha bazi", not "baka basi".
blackblog	The political establishment does not care who is in charge in Afghanistan beyond making sure the poppies grow tall. That‚Äôs why Bush Jr invaded, to protect the CIA heroine source.
Garnet K	I think bob corker ought to be chained to a bed and used as a sex slave by a bunch of greazy afghani`s and then see if he`ll still vote against the practice. hmmm anyone who would vote against that though is probably totally into it. so maybe he's not the best example to use. send him a shitload of phone calls maybe.
Got George	I can‚Äôt believe this even has to be said. This is why I do not and will never pay taxes again.
Rebel with a cause	Always excellent commentary.   Mohammed was a Pedo..so there's a 1400 years history of abusing children. We have Pedo's and worse pedovores in our Govt, in Holly-pervert-wood, The Bohemian grove, In the Catholic..Jesuit church and everywhere there's access to children.
Allan Quartermain	Interesting story I was wondering if you get any blow back from the main stream on these stories, what has been done to stop the practice. A real shame we don‚Äôt have reporting like this in the UK. If we did the wind rush debacle would still be in the news.
Alex kaneh bosm	American tax dollars hard at work ..
Jaime Tapia	It's an Islamist fundamentalism culture, Barbarian Islamism supremacy. From Mohammed and the Koran:  Koran 52:24 Round about them will serve, to them, boys (handsome) as pearls well-guarded.  Koran 56:17 Round about them will serve boys of perpetual freshness.  Koran 76:19 And round about them will serve boys of perpetual freshness: if thou seest them, thou wouldst think them scattered pearls.
