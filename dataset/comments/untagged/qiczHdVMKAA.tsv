Cheat Activated	Best podcast
Devn	You should do one of these with spratt the Britishman leading optic content bc everyone else is lacking if you really look at how often the team is uploading or streaming individually
Chris Yancey	Hector and his random ass facts he spouts "every high school athlete takes a downgrade when they go to college in facilities" ... good lord do some research about D1 sports or anything before you spout randomness with nothing to back it up.
KevTBx	That‚Äôs crazyyyyy I didn‚Äôt know he was born in Lufkin,Texas!!! That‚Äôs crazyyy lets goo Lufkin!!
Req_NadeFrame	Still love how optic podcast has had nothing but audio issues since it was created (hecz screams in my ear and hitch sounds like he's in the next room). Then, Hector starts his own podcast and it's been flawlessüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mahck Media	I don' keep up as much to the COD community as I once did, so it was cool hearing all the throwback stories. Big ups!
itsTitle	3 kids here, wife went all natural with all of them.  Loved this section of the podcast eventhough it didn't cover 90% of the audience.  But wise words my dudes.
Thomas 1MD	Who remembers the red and blue backdrops for fwiz and hastro back in mw2! I was 11 years old and i remember looking at that nV roster just dreaming of one day putting nV in my name. Never happened tho lol
nGageD	River......
Wizard	Get some random fan on the podcast
Abram Morales	Holy shat Hastro is from Lufkin? I live near lufkin. That is insane!
Strawhat Pervy	I never heard of Hastro but this was one hell of a Podcast.
FLotorious	Hey Hector, I‚Äôm sure you probably won‚Äôt see this, but I don‚Äôt use any social media so this is the only place I have to say it and I have to say it. You and your channel have done so much for me, you have no idea.   I am a single father of two girls. So the beginning of this particular video really got me choked up and decided that now was the time to finally say something.  I started off following OpTic in Bo1 and was determined to grind my way on to the pro team and/or become a content creator, until later that year when we found out that I was going to be a father. It changed everything. I was 17 and so scared. I had to cut back playing almost completely but I watched every event that year. Amazing thinking back on the times when MLG CoD really started to Blume. Mw3 was such a big year for OpTic, specially OpTic CoD and honestly all of the streams got me through that first year of being a father much easier. I could go in depth, year by year, and tell you about how much each year/change/moment got me through all of my ups and downs but I know how busy you are so I‚Äôll try to keep it short. Fast forward to 2018. I have my 8 year old queen and another 2 year old princess. Unfortunately we lost their mother during the birth of my youngest. It was the absolute hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to deal with and 2 years later it still feels like it isn‚Äôt real. I want you to know how much your Vlogs/videos and now the Eavesdrop has gotten me through the most difficult time of my life. You don‚Äôt know how much you truly have helped me stay on track through inspiration and motivation to be a better man. Watching you move through life and day to day situations no matter how good or bad, the way that you do, honesty has taught me so much. Seeing the amazing father you are and that you manage to be even with the insanely busy life/career you have is incredible. You have never changed since day 1. You are literally one of the only things in my life that hasn‚Äôt changed on me. I‚Äôm not sure you know how much that means to someone like me. Sometimes you just need something familiar to hold on to. Over the years, dedicating myself to being the absolute best father and man that I can possibly be, I haven‚Äôt had the time or the funds to game/record/stream the way that I would have liked to. But I will some day, and you give me hope that I will accomplish that goal. I Haven‚Äôt had the chance to see the CoD team compete in person. But I will some day, and you give me hope that I will accomplish that goal. Some day I‚Äôm going to meet you, shake your hand, look you in the eyes and say thank you. At the end of the day, I want you to know that if nothing else, you changed my life and indirectly changed the life of two little girls. You are a huge part of the reason that I am the man that I am. Never change brother!! I don‚Äôt have the money these days to really support the streams or buy any of the merch but AS SOON as I do, you know I am building my self a man cave and filling that bish up with OpTic everything! Can‚Äôt wait to send you a pic of that someday. But no matter how much OG stuff I buy, I will NEVER be able to repay you and all that you have done for me. I‚Äôm going to stop rambling now and I apologize for the horrible writing. Doubt you‚Äôll ever see this but if you do, just know that you will forever have a fan and a supporter in me! Thank you SO MUCH HECTOR!!!! All the love in the world from my little family my brother ü§ôüèª
Josh Hisgen	i hope hexz knows hes a father figure to a lot more people besides his players. much love to both these guys!

Niimbus	Love hastr0, envyus overwatch team was what got me into esports and now Dallas fuel :) good luck for season 2 ‚ù§Ô∏è
Richie Pearson	I‚Äôm not a big podcast person but I really enjoy watching the eavesdrop series. I‚Äôm 25 and grew up during the rise of COD esports so I know a reasonable amount of the information that has been talked about in all these podcasts but it really is super cool to hear it come from the horse‚Äôs mouth. Can‚Äôt wait to see the guests that you have coming in the future!

Adan Benitez	People I think would be interesting on this podcast   Bigtymer- fucking hilarious and it would just be a whole lot of fun  Karma 3 ringz- his views on BO4 how competition has grown and his experience through competitive cod  Joe Rogan- overall would be a really interesting conversation  Jude- would be interesting to see her perspective on your growth

Yaacx	We want Temperr
Rick Rackow	a secretary/personal assistant has multiple purposes but to be honest, first and foremost it allows you more time for people, your team; less time on outlook, excel and word. you still make the decisions when it matters and a personal assistant is a person of trust so they are hard to hire, but therefore have a good understanding of what you think. I still would recommend to get one at a certain point and my opinion from a distance is that you‚Äôre past this point but i guess you‚Äôre a bit of a control freak. still think about it. just saying.
LiliPoP	Yonas - "Y.O.N.A.S."

Thangs	Need to get bigt and merk and rambo on the podcast not together tho
iTokexCreative	I experianced the same thing with my wife and our 3rd child . Baby boy was born with a cord around his neck not breathing and purple.  My wife started bleeding out and it didnt stop . Baby was saved then the doctors proceeded to stop my wife's bleeding . One of the worst child births the doctor has ever seen . That's what he told us .    But now our son is 2 months and my wife is 100% healed

Nathan Miller	WHY HAS YOU NOT TALKED WITH PUCKETT YET
T.J. Elder	Hey, set idea!. What about a false wall with a mirror on it that is behind you, as he has one behind him it gives the idea of a single room and when its over you can move it around. Just an idea,  Keep on keepin on! I have a few other ideas for the guys on streaming if you care to chat.

TreyKhan	Hecz, in 2007 I went through almost the exact same scenario with my wife.  It turned what should have been the best day to one of the worst days of my life.  My son is now 11 and my wife has recovered.  I definitely understand what you went through.  Due to the complications and the resulting hysterectomy it has put a strain on our relationship and her relationship with my son as well.  I hope Jude and Liv do not have similar issues.
Kniqhtso	I'm surprised you didn't talk about the added rivalry of aches now being on nv and his rivalry vs optic
PrimePresents	Hastro then Castro???
Epy	If Texas cared so much about sports then why haven't they made Jerry Jones sell the Cowboys? Lol that's a joke people, not one bit serious.
Don Joe	Two goats
x_Sh4dow_ LucK_x	HECZ,  I appreciate the first segment of this Podcast sooo much.  My wife and I are foster parents and the statement you made that its easy to become a dad but it is difficult and an honor to be a father rings very true in my world.  I have dealt with some "parents" that make me question a lot of things.  But the blessing of having a child and/or children in the home and being for them every moment is truly life changing.  Thank you
Delaware Outdoors	God these are so good. Couldn't wait to wake up this morning and listen while drinking coffee on the way to work. Keep rollin Hecz would love to have Jude on here!
Swish Gaming	I loved the  podcast respect to both organizations love and respect to Hecz and hastr0

Raj Deliwala	Hecz you forgot to mention the second thing you‚Äôd go back and change, if I had to guess I‚Äôd be letting the halo team go and letting the cod dynasty break
Michael Burman	You should do the original founder of faze
Amethyst	With Formal, Merk, Crim and Karma I don‚Äôt think the dynasty would‚Äôve taken place. Scump really was the staple to that team, he was an animal in all 3 jetpack games.
Its Just Dee	I cried listening to the story about u almost losing Jude. I have a 10 year old son and I cant even imagine the level of anxiety and everything else u felt that day. Salute!
Cousins Empire	I‚Äôm 32 got a 5 year old daughter and another one on the way!
Kyle Gleavey	River rufail is a cool name
Willis K	Hastro seems super cool. This was an amazing podcast with great information was really cool to hear you guys talk about your rivalry and just how much you each motivate each other to do better.  Damn its crazy to think about what would have happened if Scump really left Optic for NV or if NV had picked up Crim and Karma.
Jordan Davies	Thank you for this Hecz, love you brother‚ù§Ô∏è
Underpaid	Awesome dude great podcast can‚Äôt wait for syndicate ,get Tom in dude
