E Jay	Hi everyone. I was reading 1 thesalonians 3:13, and I must admit I‚Äôm a little confused.  I‚Äôm trying to see this verse with a pre Tribulation lense. Can you help me understand?  Please and thanks!!
DayzofWarx	Glory to Jehovah thro his Son Yeshua Jesus Christ .
Idaho 308	Christians need to put on the FULL ARMOR of God...not the comfortable bits. What is coming cannot be prayed away...face facts, we were told it was coming and now look...it is upon us. Prepare for spiritual warfare with the FULL ARMOR of God because what is coming for us may not be what we think it might be....prepare to be blindsided...prepare to have your spiritual weaknesses  exploited.
WordupknowJesus	What would happen if Christians all over the world started doing what the bible tells us to do?  All of it.   Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  Mark 16:17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;   Instead of Hosea 4: 6 (KJV) My people perish from a lack of knowledge. And Mark 7:13 ‚ÄúMaking the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.‚Äù Matthew 15:  So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:  8  ‚Äú‚ÄòThis people honors me with their lips,  but their heart is far from me;  9  in vain do they worship me,  teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.‚Äô  Instead of complaining about how bad the world is, a world that has not seen the true full gospel taught and in acted,  we need to study and do what it says to do so we will have the results we want to have.  I do not believe the Lord wants us to be crying and begging to go home, but to run our race to the full !  Victory after Victory in Jesus name.  There are Christians right now doing these things and they need help !!!  Do you know that many today are shocked and repelled if you ask to pray that a loved one who died be raised ?  Even if they died at a young age.  Even if their salvation is in question.  Even if this is the will of God as stated clearly in his word but most Christians do not know what the bible teaches.  We are always asking the Lord to do what he told us to do.  Wake up church and be doers of the whole word, not just the part your comfortable with or that your man made traditions have lulled you into believing are enough.  The Lord would not have told us that we would do the things he did and greater things would we do if he had not meant for us to do them.  There are videos on YouTube that tell about healing and raising the dead.  Watch them.  Thank you Lord.
Crystal Prater	I love how you used the abc blocks to present the gospel GODBLESS YOU BROTHER

Ruth Graff	Pastor do you think that there will be civil unrest soon in most states after the election
Yahshua Freak 2000	Look at the great awakening!! I pray for more preachers in the church to start teaching like this! So many churches won't touch any of these topics. I'm afraid they will fall away when things get REAL bad. Praying for all.!
Michele Swanby	We need to ask God to forgive us and protect us. Pray he will protect all our borders. While the world is watching the southern border, is anyone paying attention to our other borders and coastlines?
Mark Woods	FYI: There have been four attempts on President Trump already.

TheLamp03	Wake up, the European  or Caucasian Americans Christianity has rocked us to sleep. First of all, these European Christians killed millions of aboriginal people and colonized their land. After stealing the land, these same Christians enslaved a nation of negro people for 400 years and supervised their captivity. They introduced the slave to their European Messiah and their Christian doctrine. Secondly, they enforced illiteracy upon the negro man to prevent self identity and the true knowledge of their God (Most High). I often wonder if there is a correlation between the true Messiah being hung in a tree and the hanging of negros. They wrote in their constitution that the negros are 3/5 of a man. What true man of God (Most High) would portray a human this way? They denied the negro man and woman basic human rights. The European nation of Christians worked the negro slave from sun-up to sun- down without pay, gave them ungodly foods, and conditioned them to live in poor living conditions. Taught the negro man to become a whoremonger  to produce a stronger slave-man to sell. These Europeans Christians also rape women, men and children and called themselves the children of god. I still ask the question, which god? Oh, by the way, Satan is a god too. This nation of European Christians or godly people used the negro child as gator bait, how godly is this action? This is truly the new Egypt and this Pharaoh is more ruthless than the first, although similar. These Christians continue to show who they are with a continued onslaught of the negro man, with countless murders by their Christian police force and citizens. This European or Caucasian Christian doctrine is not for those of you who truly believe in the Most High and the true Messiah, if you want to survive what‚Äôs about to happen, come out of her. This is proof that the earth is given into the hands of the wicked. The European/Caucasian Christians doesn‚Äôt understand that what ever a man reap, he will also sew. If you think that the true GOD (Most High) is going to allow you to get away with vile violations of his word, you got another thing coming. ‚ÄúPrepare slaughter for his children for the iniquities of their fathers‚Äù. What ever you put into the universe prepare to get double, because the Most High doesn‚Äôt like how harshly you dealt with his people. Furthermore,  the negros that perpetuate these beliefs in the community will die with her in the last days, because you partake in her SINS. By the way, Easu ‚ÄúIS NOT‚Äù the Caucasian or White man.  How could Easu be Caucasian/white with BLACK parents and the twin of Jacob his BLACK brother? Just remember the earth in given into  them hands of the wicked. Lastly, I have noticed that any time a nation find themselves in the Word (Bible) and it‚Äôs not favorable they write their own book (Bible) Judaism (Talmud), Islam (Quran), Mormonism (Book of Mormon),and Catholicism (Catholic Bible), etc.
Yeshua Disciple	amy erickson Pastor....please see what the closed caption says that you said at the 34:27 mark! Wow... I am CERTAIN that you did NOT say "Praise Allah Praise Allah" but whoever typed your captions did...
Isaiah Martin	Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Everyone should Read The International Jew by Henry Ford, The Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion, The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, Israel's 5 Trillion Dollar Secret, From Babylon To Timbuktu, The Thirteenth Tribe, and Bloodlines of The Illuminati for starters. The Revelation 2:9 Caucasian synagogue of Satan jews in Israel funded slavery; they owned 90% of the slave-ships and plantations and were the main beneficiaries of the Trans-Atlantic Slave-Trade.   Zondervan‚Äôs Bible Dictionary: Ham ‚Äì The youngest son of Noah, born probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the dark races; NOT The Negroes, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites.  The Real Hebrew are the so-called Negroes or African Americans, and those who were scattered through out the world via The Transatlantic slave-trade. Act. 7:6. Deuteronomy 28:15-68. Luke 21:24. The Negroes are the Lost Sheep of the house of Israel. 1619-2019 Biblical Prophecy Fulfilled.   Acts 7:6 Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. Deuteronomy 28:15-68. Daniel 9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. Isaiah 42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. Jeremiah 17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever. Isaiah 1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. Lamentations 1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. Luke 21:24 They shall fall by the edge of the sword and be taken captives into all nations. Jerusalem will be trodden down by gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled. Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Revelation 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.    Song of Solomon 1:5-6 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as black as the tents of Kedar, as black as the curtains of Solomon. Job 30:30 my skin was black upon me. Lamentations 4:8 my skin was blacker than coal. Isaiah 47:1-2 we had dreadlocks. Acts 13:1 I was called a nigger. Daniel 7:9 burnt bronze skin Revelations 1:13-15 hair like wool skin like burnt bronze. Song Of Solomon 5:11 My dreadlocks are black & bushy. Enoch was a pitch black Ethiopian. Moses married a black Ethiopian and passed for a black Egyptian and Pharaoh son. Baby Jesus, Mary, & Joseph fled to Egypt to hide. Jesus walked the desert for 40 days. Israel is on the continent of Africa. The real Jews were Egyptian sun-slaves and have always been Black/Negro.   Thus saith The LORD, Thus saith The Holy Bible. Amen. God Bless.
David Holt	I had this thought pop into my head today when I saw a video (not yours) that said definitively that Halloween was THE day of the rapture - of course as I'm writing this, Halloween was yesterday  LOL.  But I wondered if anyone else has had this thought about such prophetic claims: If anyone says they know the day and turn out to be correct - hasn't scripture been broken?  Matthew 24:36  "But of that DAY and hour no one knows, not even the angels of Heaven, but My Father only".  That being said: Either the bible is correct and NO man knows the day... or the bible is wrong and one  person somehow cracked the code, exalted himself above all other humans (and angels!) giving himself bragging rights for all eternity for figuring out the exact day of the rapture.  Maybe God in his infinite wisdom (and sense of humor) is waiting for the day that NO man states TODAY is going to be THE day for the rapture. LOL
Mara natha	It used to be that when a HUGE number of young men DEMANDED entrance into a country, not their own, while condemning said country, burning said country's flag and containing gang members, drug traffickers, and other criminal elements, that said country's citizens would realize they were being INVADED.  So, I ask democrats.....How would you even recognize an invasion?  What does one look like to YOU?  Their response is always the same.  "We cannot be invaded if we get rid of our borders."     Our country is doomed, folks.  Democrats destroy a state with their actions and then like locusts move onto a neighboring state and do the same.  Here in Virginia, we are receiving Maryland's rejects, New York's rejects.....And they are changing our once great state into the very disaster they left.  Their response is always the same.  "You have money and you should share it."  Until it is all gone apparently and they leave with it....to do the same to another state.  We are in a lifeboat and they happily let everyone in.....even when their own families are tossed out to make room for more.  I've watched as some of these "socialist parents" say it is just fine that an illegal killed their child....They didn't mean it.  What kind of parent says that?  How have we become a country that encourages its own destruction?  Why are we training our children to hate themselves, their country, their gender, their lives and then calling it "tolerance and acceptance".  IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE.  These children will never have normal lives or "fit in".  We are designing a very broken and dare I say it, SHATTERED world.  This is not God's intention for us, our country or our families.   Democrats live in a bubble with a large plate glass window.  They feel untouched by what they see and indeed "see" it differently (through rose colored glasses) from the rest of us who are daily impacted by it.  They just showed the John Carpenter movie, "They Live".  How appropriate.
Paul Revere	I love this man, truth is a beautiful thing.
Cindy Lambert	My cousin Tammy needs mental healing, and to be blessed with a real Christian husband, and soon. 1 that can move her away from her drug addicted brother.  Thank-you for you're prayers
my fountain	ABC of Salvation, so easy that even a child can comprehend it. Salvation is a gift of God lest any should boast. Believe with your heart  not head, and confess with your mouth, not just lip service. And Jesus also said, Unless, a man is born again of the Holy Spirit he will by NO MEANS ENTER IN.   Many times I believed  with my heard,and gave lip service. But one day I truly BELIEVED,  with ALL my heart and confessed Jesua as Lord and Savior ,and was born again in an instant. He did it for me he will do it for you.

Richard Freeman	JD I‚Äôve been listening to your Prophecy Updates for only a year or so and I‚Äôve enjoyed them very much, well most of what you report on most of the time. This is one time when I disagree with your assessment of the time we‚Äôre in. 1John 4:4 outlines who is really in control and of course what you say is a matter of interpretation or perception and whether you meant to paint such a gloomy picture or not I don‚Äôt know but you gave way to much credit to our adversary and you eft one with more gloom than hope as you said whoever wins the election. When His Word is so filled with Hope and Promise. Especially when the Righteous rule.Proverbs is 14:34. There is great Hope when the Righteous Rule. Prayer is our Greatest Weapon yet I didn‚Äôt hear that mentioned as our battle plan. Nor any plan of action, definitely no hope In the outcome of our up coming elections. In this last days Satan and his demons are on overtime but The Righteous are Promised to be overcomer‚Äôs and all authority and power has been given to us for what? To deliver the lost and helpless. A message of hope as Love covers a multitude of sins,  who overcomes the world and the anti christ our faith in Jesus Christ.

Judy Klafta	Eleven Jews are murdered. Anti-Semitic acts in the US are up 600% since Trump came into office and you are worried about people fleeing violence and trying to better there lives just like all of our ancestors did. This really shows how much you care about the Jewish nation. If you don"t care about the Jews in the US why should we think you are for Israel.
Greg Blankenship	Block the liberals,vote them out.
Savedbygrace	Thank you Pastor, and bless you and your family. Anyone that wants to come over and adopt our country as their home, properly vetted through our system, and come legally, obey our laws, learn our language, work, pay taxes, wonderful, that is great. To all those wanting to come here illegally, forcing their way in, unvetted and agressively, is breaking the law. No country should tolerate such, this is nothing but an aggressive invasion. You cannot convince me that all the people in this caravan just suddenly decided to all march toward our country at the same time, no way. All right before the elections, how coincidental? There is nothing wrong in protecting our country, it's citizens, and our homes and family.
Laura Parra	Can I get a print out of the abc of salvation

marta sanimill	It is terrifying to think that illegals from all over the world are headed here to the mainland with full intention of an invasion. And it IS an INVASION!  They are NOT refugees. They are criminals with intent to invade. What is wrong with People?? They are not ready to love our country or our laws, or our people!  I watched and read and followed when this happened in Europe. But Yes God is in control. Pray. Claim Psalm 91.
workaholic53	Consider what will happen when the rapture occurs, as much as 1/3 of the country will disappear including many of those who make the country run.  America will degenerate into chaos, not a force for change in the world, but a fall into irrelevance.  It is plain to see if looked for.
Tazzamania	Morning everyone, just a question here, did you know, that there are  about 70 books that were never added to the bible. I do not know why? These lost books are assessable  on line to read though. Does any of my brothers and sisters in Christ think that perhaps any of the lost books that were never published are of any importantance? The book of Enoch, Enoch had to be a good man because he is mentioned in the bible and wasn't he the one God just took to heaven? Gen @  And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. Some people who have read it say that  it's prophecy that whites will be the minority in the last  days. If this is so, then this prophecy is happening.  I have started reading some of these lost books, and one of them is called Jasher. I have read up to chapter 7 so far. In chapter 7 it mentions  CUSH, that is mentioned where it says CUSH and PUT are with them, when they lay seizge against Jerusalem, the battle of Armageddon, Cush is not a place, it's a person. After the flood, Jasher tells of Noah's sons having children and Nimrod became ruler but he was not a man of God. So Cush and some of  descendants were evil...Some of these lost books fill in parts of revelation that we can only guess at. Does anyone here feel that some of the lost books have anything to do with God are prophecy? Should we even read them? DO they hold any signifigance at all? I hope someone will  comment on this and tell me what you think about these lost books. God Bless.

MAURICIO ROSALES	The shooter in Pittsburgh said the Jews are children of Satan John 8:44 Jesus Christ tell the Samaritan that their father is the devil and he is the father of liars revelation 3:9 the church in Philadelphia talks about those that are of the synagogue of Satan but claim they are Jews they are not but (keyword are liars) I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. Now I‚Äôm thinking that the seven church‚Äôs are on seven continents so the church of Philadelphia is the United States of America so where are the others pray that the church‚Äôs do what Jesus Christ told them to do and pray for their leaders all church‚Äôs are to get raptured it‚Äôs not just Laodicea the church of Philadelphia will be saved from the great tribulation which also means all the other church‚Äôs will to because Revelation 22:16 says I Jesus have sent my angel to give this testimony for the churches.

Eric Kramer	God's Roadmap to the End I get excited any time they talk about peace in the Middle East, and I often find myself asking ‚Äú Peace and Security? Peace and Safety?‚Äù, and it‚Äôs not because I think humanity is going to solve all of the world‚Äôs problems, but instead, because I see it ( based on Scripture) as a road sign that we are going to be heading up very soon!  My girlfriend and I are both strong believers in the Person of Jesus Christ; and though I would love to marry her one day, our ultimate hope is in the Lord Jesus Christ!  She was born with Spina Bifida, and I have M.S; but we know that no such things will be found in Heaven! God never promised me a problem-free life, and He certainly doesn‚Äôt OWE me anything!!!  I‚Äôm ready to go; and if I‚Äôm gone before Breakfast, that will be just fine with me!
Ms. Sonshine	Online I read a lot of comments of hatred against Jewish people.  And I can personally say defending Jewish people falls on death ears.  A lot of ignorance.  Jesus has given me a heart for Israel and the Jewish people.

Arthur Gros	Concerning the Migrants .The Globalist have already flooded Europe with Muslims that will never assimilate. They have in effect destroyed all nationalism paving the way for a One World Government. The United States has so far been able to block at least minimize this effort. The solution in the minds of the Globalist is to instead flood America with millions of South American's. They have no loyalties to America if FACT their localities lie with The Jesuit Pope of Rome . Petrus Romanus, the self proclaimed Vicar of Christ. Before anyone gets up in arms this is NOT an Anti-Catholic rant. Most Catholic's in America if not openly then at least privately Reject this Pope. I have for different reasons , funeral's and what not been to several Catholic Masses over the last year or so. These Churches have embraced much of the theology of the Reformation while the Emerging Church and Ecumenical Churches have Gone by way of the Globalist. These so called caravans if allowed to enter the United States with their loyalty to this Globalist Jesuit Pope will forever change the Social Landscape of America in a way Millions of Hispanics over the past 200 years never have or never will.
Matha Stinner	Any body who want to kill all Jews is cheating himself or herself unless they can kill all people in this wicked world and they should know that Jews out number all  people in this Planet.

CINDY L GASTON	Pastor J.D., your church is my church home from now on.  I praise the Lord Jesus Christ for you and pray for you and your family, and for my new brothers and sisters in Christ.  I live in Texas now, but can't wait to hear The Lord's Triumphant Shout--He's saying it's almost time!  Please pray for my husband's salvation.
Theuns Groenewald	All the way from South Africa = God Bless you Pastor JD. You encourage us all so much! Come soon my Saviour, Lord Jesus.
Claudia Sherfy	Thank you Pastor for speaking truth. Love and prayers in Christ.

Polly Wog	I made a comment the other day about the date of 11/11 on utube 11/11/11 2018=11....and one of my feedback was clearly from a Muslim who who commented My family is Coming... and I commented back....Caravan??? he commented back Remember your comment...I went to his page he definitely has demons w what he posted on his utube channel...Pray ppl will Wake Up...God children r going home soon..üíï
Anna Leet	That picture reminds me of when the other countries mostly men came to Greece I think it was. Shortly after wasn't the crisis in the banks? I could be wrong. Just more pieces to add to the table. Christian's need to get ready to love others like Jesus loves us and like we love ourselves. We have to learn this now before we are persecuted! And I also was just made aware yesterday Europe is under Sha'ri law!  Ever since I was little they said what happens in Europe eventually spreads to America!
Dave Plachetzki	He just brought all the thoughts I had about our country and party and religion together in the last fifteen minutes....my head just blew up...But I regress ...Our Lord said the end times would be like a woman in trevail...it's going to get worse and worse until what I think will be a shaking, revival, then rapture. (TRIBULATION!!!). We are going home soon in light of eternity!!!!!!  Prrrraise Ghhod!!!!!!!!üòÄ!!!!!!!
Sean Y	I‚Äôm a Korean American currently living in S. Korea. I have been watching for the Lord for the past 3 years and have been following Pastor JD‚Äôs prophecy updates. Thank you Pastor for your work. It always keeps me anchored and alert. I am also a 5th grade teacher here in Korea and I have used the ABC‚Äôs of salvation multiple times to my students! God bless your ministry. Can‚Äôt wait to meet you in the air.
Hilux244	Luke 21:35 For as a snare shall it come upon all them who dwell upon the face of the whole earth   Ponder that. Also the 5 WISE VIRGINS know the scriptures and are praying Luke 21:36 always, as instructed by Jesus  Luke 21:35-36  35¬†For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. 36¬†Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to  escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the  Son of man.
Cindy Rose	üïõ TIME IS UP...Get Ready...  ARE YOU GOING TO HEAVEN... Answer this simple question... Have you ever Lied, Stolen anything or used God's/Jesus name as a curse word? ‚ñ™‚òπTHE BAD NEWS: If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemer. Even doing just one of these things you will be found guilty. God says that if you are guilty you will end up in eternal Hell. ‚ñ™üòÅTHE GOOD NEWS: The one true God, of the Holy Bible, loves you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay your sin debt... ‚ñ™üòóTHE GOSPEL THAT SAVES: Jesus took all your sin upon himself, he went to the cross, died in your place, paying your sin debt. Then Jesus was buried in a tomb & He rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life...In victory! ‚ñ™üéÅRECEIVE HIS GIFT...Jesus offers His GIFT of salvation to ALL who would put their trust in Him as their Savior, trusting in who Jesus is and what he did for you on the cross.  üëçWhen you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior you are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God as a child of God. So, when God looks at you, He no longer sees you guilty as a sinner but sees the righteousness of Jesus Christ's on you.  *Receiving Jesus comes from a sincere heart...Please pray this prayer with a sincere heart... ‚ù§PRAY: Jesus Christ, I come to you a sinner, in need of your forgiveness. I believe you are the Son of God, that you went to the cross, died in my place, paying my sin debt and that you were buried & rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life. Jesus, right now, I choose to receive you as my Lord and my Savior, trusting in you alone for my salvation. I surrender my life to you and ask for your will to be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart to make me more like you. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for filling me with the Holy Spirit and for your gift of eternal life in Heaven. Amen!
Shelba Christian	My words exactly: we are being invaded!!!!
Susanna Jacobi	The same people who created the European migrant crisis created the US migrant crisis! The difference is that we in Europe only get men of islamic background. I would be happy about Mexicans‚Ä¶ Nevertheless - Jesus is coming soon and time is running out on planet earth. I am fine with this and lift up my head :-) Thank you for your great work every week!
Allie S.	My pastor just taught on Revelation yesterday that ch 6-8 has been the last 2000 years and we the church are the 144,000 and the two witnesses. Ugh. ‚òπÔ∏è Replacement theology. God help our churches
Steve Arnst	2018 could end up being a big year prophetically. Once this year is over it‚Äôs only going to intensify! Prophetic signs aren‚Äôt slowing down, they will only continue to speed up. We are at a point of no return.
larry craddock	Revelation chapter 1 verse 14: His head and Hair where like like wool, as white as snow,and His eyes like a flame of fire,His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace,and His voice as the sound of many waters ; He had in His right hand seven stars,out of His mouth went a two edged sword,and His Countenance was like the sun shining in it's strength! Come Lord Jesus!
sajna thomas	Thank you pastor for this message.
Dep Lor	Pastor I so look forward to the Prophecy Update. It brings me hope every week. God bless you and your family and team!
Lyn Monton	He lied to get the votes. Muslims are allowed to lie. If anyone thinks he is not. Well then I don‚Äôt know what your seeing when you say his name to yourself. If a child‚Äôs father is Muslim they are automatically considered a Muslim. Not to mention his step father was Muslim as well.
ShariL Wilkison	Dear bro Pastor JD.... Praise God , I thank HIM for you.  I pray blessings and protection for you and your family.  You are a good and faithful servant , full of passion for our most beautiful Lord and Savior Christ Jesus. Praise God for the strength HE gives you to do HIS will in these times.    I feel so very overwhelmed to even remember EVERYTHING and EVERYONE of us in NEED of pray these days.  My biggest fear is the knowledge that the people whom are most in need of the messages that  Pastor JD  and  others share, are the people who are not listening.  I personally feel this to be a very difficult, overwhelming, and exhausting struggle. Let us please pray for one another in this area üôèüèª
S. Hibbs	Pastor JD,  I am so happy that you are Preaching the TRUTH, so many Christians have no idea where we are in¬† todays World.  The todays Christian Church are preaching Happy joyyyyyy joy and feel good messages.  Now we all know the the true Joy comes through Christ, However, Jesus himself told and taught TRUTHs and truth is not always JOY AND FEEL GOOD.   We as Christians need to hear the truth and be watchful for things to come and history to know what is  coming for us all.  End times is not Happiness in the sense that it is not Joy and fun times as Christians.  We will be with him YEs that is awesome but, it is a time of Truth and many will perish. Pastor keep preaching the TRUTH and The hard Message.. God Bless and I know Many are praying for you !!!  God Bless your CHURCH !!!
K.A. Boncon	Yes the timing of the caravan is no coincidence. Regarding the mid-terms this is what my son and I talked about last night. God's will, will be done. Vote, yes of course, but God is sovereign. It is my belief that against all odds Donald Trump was elected President. Godly people were praying and God moved mountains! God did it and he did so for his plans and purposes. We all know the Bible clearly says that things will get worse as the end draws nearer so how long this Godly reprieve will last is up to him.  For now I enjoy the direction President Trump is taking our country but it is clear Satan is ramping up his efforts. The vile and ungodly are waxing worse and literally want to destroy this country and all moral boundaries as well. Vote, pray and trust God. He will use all leaders to accomplish his prophetic word, Don't fear. I pray Jesus is coming soon to take his precious, blood bought Bride to be with him! Maranatha!!
lee wai	Really appreciate your effort. May God bless you abundantly,
Gary Jacobi Sr.	PLEASE don't yell, I'm sure I'm not the only one with sleeping children & after you yell than so does my wife yell at me.
spiritual truth	Ur right about all this we are in the end of time's
Hescomingagain	Scary times we live in for sure....BUT GOD..‚ô• ‚ô•
Snowpersonable	You can not preach the Word and not be passionate about it!¬† Keep yelling....it gives strong emphasis to what you're teaching!¬† We know you aren't yelling at us but at Satan and the unGodliness out there!
Forty One	Amen Pastor JD. I brought my wife and daughters over from Thailand. The US Government, customs and immigration put me through 13 months of pure agony with paperwork, fees, and background checks. My entire life was examined as was my wife and kids just to get to the USA. So yes, if I had to go through this as a US citizen, everyone else that comes here must undergo the same process. To those scoffers and liberals; until you've had to go through it, you've not earned a right to offer your uneducated opinion.
Keith Klein	Spot on Pastor revolution Satan rising the evil presence shadow is consuming this land and peoples time is short.
Geann Freeman	I believe you are on target J.D., Jesus is coming soon!
Dane Nel	Hello from South Africa, please pray for all of us here too. The world is upside down and there is only 1 who can fix it and that is Jesus Christ!!

Emmy Imladris	This is such a touching sermon. I pray for America and Israel.  As an American abroad I am feeling like I should get more involved.  I am going to look into voting   I am sure I am too late for this election but I will pray and trust God for the result.
Megan Poff	I think people need to wake up and see Trump for who he is... a Trojan horse. He is a snake in the grass. Everyone is so focused on Obama who needs to be left in the past where he belongs. Trump wants this 3rd Temple in Jerusalem built and so many  Christians are just asleep!  I ask you. Search the scriptures. Ask God to reveal to you the truth. He will show you everything. God is rising up His remnant army - but to think we‚Äôre going to have it easy, think again. The Apostle Paul certainly didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm kingdom minded folks, America is mystery Babylon - please wake up.
Margaret Makewell	Could we online have a PDF of the ABC‚Äôs of Salvation?
Ben RuddFranssen	Kia Ora JD! From the ends of the earth in Christchurch New Zealand. Keep on yelling!!!
PokeyVids	Pastor JD. I always love your updates. But please don‚Äôt get caught up in the election. Who cares what will happen after the election because GOD is on your side. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt vote but ultimately He will decide who gets elected for His purposes.   Now about the caravan. I‚Äôm sorry but out of the couple of hundred people in that one perspective photo I saw a lot of woman and children. And why does gender matter when most of your family have been killed threatened robbed blackmailed to join various gangs etc. they are refugees escaping violence and persecution. Even our Lord was a refugee to Egypt and back again. Your own family escaped persecution. Remember to look after the stranger and foreigner in your land because you were foreigners in Egypt.   I love the fact you tend to stay clear of politics please continue to do so focus on GoD and Jesus and the ABCs.
sifu jedi	1peter4:7 " ...so that we may pray" therefore there must be a time when one would not be able to pray

thomas schneider	thank you
Laura Zamot-Backus	Good morning Pastor! The time is  4:45am in Atlanta, Ga. right now. Every morning I wake up eagerly awaiting your videos. This one really broke my heart for my Jewish brothers and sisters. Please forgive me, but I'm so wanting the Lord to come! I know I'm not worthy, but this reason Jesus died for us. I'm so upset this morning. I pray for each family affected by this madness. I pray for you, your family, and your church family. Please keep my family and our ministry in prayer. God bless everyone reading this and know that Jesus loves you deeply.
Mel Russell	Yes pastor we should not expect an easy time for Christians even before the rapture. Keep yelling pastor it keeps the rest of us from screaming
Robin Kirk	Thank you Pastor for these messages! My husband and I watch you each week. Please don't stop... Also, we homeschool and I've been using the ABC's of salvation to simplify the gospel for my kids during Bible time!
N Deming	Please do NOT apologize for declaring the truth and your passion about it!  You are  voicing what I and others feel and sense.  I believe our nation passed the point of no return last year if not a few years before....

John Grytbakk	Total civil war is coming, very soon. It is at a breaking point.  There are no true strong wise leadership, no one is doing what must be done to prevent it, so it is coming. ....and it will be UGLY.    So sad to see this day. All leaders have failed America.

ELIAD SAVEL	at the minute 36:14 you talk about JOEL 2: 32,  however, read the text in Hebrew and you will discover that WHO WILL CALL THE NAME YEHOVAH WILL BE SAVED and in Isaiah 43:11, YEHOVAH IS THE ONLY SAVIOR,  King David will be resurrected read Jeremiah 30: 9, David will be the forever king of the Israelites, 1 chronics 28:4 Ezekiel 37:25 also read Hosea 3:5  Ezekiel 34:23 and 24 and Ezekiel 37: 24 .

Come Out of Her, My People Karla Tietz	Just a thought, Pastor JD, wouldn't it be prophetic Justice for the rapture of the Church of Christ Jesus üìñüôè to occur on the birthday, October 31st, Helloween of Lucifer? I pray daily for the trumpets to sound and would welcome His coming for us at any moment, but it would really make an impact if it happens on that day.üî•üí™üõ°‚è∞üõê

Titus 2:13	Thank you so much pastor. Our family is praying for you and yours. Out of curiosity, do you remember the street you lived on in Everett?
Suzanne Young	Yes, I believe in the rapture, BUT first there is going to be a World Wide Revival. God does not want anyone to perish. So stop this talk about the rapture, get yourselves right with the Lord. Start praying in the Spirit, keep your eyes on Jesus. üôèüî•üî•üôè
Varkey Philip	Bless you, Pastor Farag. Varkey Philip from the south west corner of India.
Debbie Pressley	Ty Pastor JD Farag!!  I consider you my pastor. Thanks for all your truth and studies.  Especially in this wicked world!
russmaleartist	Do not apologize, this world and especially the church, NEEDS some yelling! We are, regardless, in the End Times, and the Lord Jesus, Who is still on His Throne, is waiting for the orders of His Father to return and bring His bride back home to his Father's House. No matter what happens, we can depend, trust, and have high expectations of the Lord's Word, Faithfulness, and absolute Sovereignty over EVERYTHING. There should be no doubt about these hard times, when God's Word emphatically explains exactly what we are to expect, and how He will bring us through until He returns. Just keep looking up . . . Jesus is coming sooner than you may think!  Just TRUST HIM, and He will reward such Faith with comfort, love, grace, mercy, and an endless and most excellent trust that will take us through anything He expects us to endure. The final Word is JESUS and in His name everything is possible . . . everything is real, and everything that is absolutely promised WILL COME TO PASS -- including the RAPTURE of the true believers in Jesus Christ -- AMEN!
Troy Fleenor	May the peace (Shalom) of God be upon all his people in these last days!
Dean Backer	Seems to be that the Democrats are the party of Lucifarions.
Andrew  de Leon	Notice something missing in his parents' picture... They're not carrying their country's flag... They're so happy to become Americans.
Kaye Kaye	Thank you. My great grandparents did it right just like your parents. I am so thankful I knew both of them when I was a little girl.  They instilled in me so much of what the truth and love as well as the hardships they endured coming to America.  It breaks my  heart that America has become what she has become. May God forgive us
Ruth Perez	The frazzle demon rats will kill there own kids for power and control. The demon rats are evil.
Ulrike Barthel	It's looks like they do the same what the elite did with us in Germany.  So sad. The time is running out, Jeschua is coming Ulrike from Germany
Amy Shields	Pastor, I can't thank you enough for boldly sharing the gospel! Please pray for me as I lead a Bible study of approximately 20 high school students, most exchange students, many who are not believers. May God be glorified!
A watchmen	Keep shouting pastor. So they might hear.
dwaynell512	Can we save souls and not worry about the world? Let it burn.. Prepare gods people not worry about this stupid politics.. That's of the world!!!!
Hope Howard	They geoengineered the Florida hurricanes from Antartica to attack Florida so they could not vote in some counties it is a Red state and a swing state
Peter S	We are called as Christians to give to those that ask and that those who do these things to the least of my brethren you did it for me. These are souls in need of help and care.  This Left Right paradigm  has cause your heart to grow cold. These souls may meet us in the clouds why do you think they are any less important to Jesus Christ. PS voting is a way for the devil to have proof you voted for people who don't stop the murder of children and adults through many ways including abortions wars slavery through the TAX and money printing ect...
Marsha Stoner	America is not what it use to be at all
Pippin Baker	Pastor JD     psalm 91              8              Num6: 24-26
Thesaurus	Pastor, bible prophecy of the end times has been unfolding since 1948. There is nothing from prophecy to prevent the Lord's return. But, God has not chosen to send Him for us yet AND He never told us when exactly to expect Him. Since 1948 people have been expecting him "any day now". Myself included. I remember pastors from 1967 telling the congregation not to bother to vote because Jesus is coming and we will be raptured. Except here it is over 50 years later and still we wait. Meanwhile, Christians, who have the most voting power in this country became complacent waiting on the rapture AND JUST LOOK AT THE MESS WE LEFT FOR OUR CHILDREN!  I am not discouraging anyone from looking up, wanting and waiting for the rapture. But, no matter how bad we want it, we don't get to decide when it happens. It is strictly up to the Father. STILL, it is a terrible mistake to discourage people from voting. Failure to vote for that which is righteous, is a vote for that which is evil. I'm pretty sure the party that promotes abortion and violent attacks on people is evil.  Please vote. We don't know when Jesus is returning for us and if previous generations of Christians had done so, perhaps evil would not have progressed to the degree it has in this country.
Lorraine Chambers	I love how much you love Jesus...your passion for sharing the Good News..
Ian Fults	When it comes to elections I learned a LONG time ago, no matter the Winner is, God is the one who put them there:  Daniel 4:17 explains it CLEARLY.  Even the LESSER of men . . .
Sally Mcintosh	Hi JD, just want to give you a 'shout out' from Gladstone Central Queensland, Australia.¬† I have been following you for a few years now and I LOVE YOUR SHOUTING!!!¬† You are a passionate man and you love God and it makes my heart sing.¬† God is doing some amazing things here in our little city.¬† In our small church alone we have had 11 Baptisms in the last month, Praise God.¬† Our church is called 'End Time Runners', so we are all very aware that our Lord Jesus is coming soon.¬† At the moment though there is work to be done and we are about our Father's business.¬† This is just one little church, in our other church's our brothers and sisters are also about 'our Fathers business'.¬† So people are coming to the Saving Grace of our Lord, and it is starting to ramp up, Praise God.¬† Anyway this was meant to be just a encouragement to you... God Bless and don't change at all JD God made you the way He wanted you too be.¬† God Bless. Sally-Anne.x
Lee Rice	Watch that French President.  The first time I saw him, I thought I was looking at the possible person who will assist the anti christ
Lisa	Someone has to yell. I look forward to hearing your updates. I live in the Bible belt and can't find a church that teaches prophecy.  Why???   Oh, how it strengthens my faith!
Jose  Poncho Villa	Very powerful thank you pastor!  I love you and your faith!  Please pray for me I need my strength, I wish to join my fellow brothers  and sisters in JESUS CHRIST for the  battle that is to come.  I'm working on my own battles right now, please brothers and sisters please pray for one another!  I believe you will so thank you very much! May GOD bless us all in the HOLY name of JESUS!
Kevin Luckey	JD, would it be fiesable for you to offer the abc's in a Trac form for sale? I would love to be able to use it tho spread the gospel. Thanks Kevin
ROMY ANTIQUERA	JD your point of View is Correct..The Boarder Law must be imposed..
Karen Widaman - It's A Dog's World K-9 Academy	Bless you Pastor JD for all that you and the church do for all the people across the globe. What a great day it will be to meet with all of them at the wedding feast!
Vaughn Michael	Spot on on your position concerning the countrys tipping point Pastor JD.  Alot of the country isn't just on the "outs" with God, but, in outright hostile rebellion.
#WeAreQ	Call me a "conspiracy theorist," but I can't help but to find it rather suspicious that we are less than two weeks away from the midterm elections and all of a sudden a slew of "alt-right"/"pro-Trump" terrorist attacks are happening out of the blue. Over the past couple of weeks, we've witnessed caravans being organized, fake bombs sent to prominent Democrats, and most recently, a mass shooting conducted inside a Jewish synagogue. What do all of these ploys have in common? They all could have an unfavorable outcome for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections; this is precisely the point. Studies have shown that the last two weeks leading up to an election are BY FAR the most important to sway undecided voters to a particular side. The Deep State Demonrats are well aware of this fact. The caravans (invasion) were organized by George Soros funded groups in collaboration with the UN in order to weaponize poor Central Americans for the sake of generating turmoil and instability. The caravans are meant to revive the largely controversial actions taken by the Trump (and Obama) administration at the US border several months back. The deep state is hoping this will make Trump, and therefore the Republicans, look bad by appealing to voters' emotions. After all, Dems LOVE to virtue signal. As for the last two aforementioned false flags, we must ask ourselves, when was the last time a Trump supporter orchestrated a terrorist attack? Now ponder what the motives of the "bomber" are, and WHO benefits? Think deeply and critically. Ask ourselves, WHY would alleged Trump supporting Republicans sabotage THEIR OWN party's successes in such an important upcoming election? They wouldn't. Nevertheless, the outrageously arrogant, Deep State Demonrats don't expect us to think this logically. They expect us to blindly accept whatever narrative THEY want us to believe without question (using the MSM as their mouthpiece, of course). That's really how little they think us.  *Let's prove them wrong by VOTING REPUBLICAN on TUESDAY NOVEMBER 6th!!!*
Evan Journey	Ok seriously, I‚Äôm scared to get raptured!  Seriously I‚Äôm TERRIFIED of heights! I wish we would just be randomly teleported there, instead of rising up to meet him in the clouds.  I realize that actually seeing Jesus in the clouds will take my fears away, but seriously at the moment that‚Äôs all I can think about and I get queasy.....
Exile 311	YouTube is taking my ‚Äúlike‚Äù away on this video.  I came back to the video to check it because I‚Äôve had this issue before.  So now I‚Äôve come back to the video like 5 times and it still shows that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù it.
grace sue	1 Corinthians 7 v 29-31  What i mean, brothers and sisters , is that the Time is Short ! From Now on  Those who have wives  Should live As if they Do Not ; Those who mourn,  As if they Did Not ; Those who are happy , As if they Were Not ;  Those who buy something,  As if they Were Not Theirs to keep ; Those who use the things of the world , As if Not Engrossed in them ! For this World in its Present Form Is Passing Away!!
Jada Parks/Villanueva	Brother JD, Thank you, as always, for a very informative PROPHECY UPDATE. I think I feel the way many christians today say, Even so, Come, LORD JESUS.  To any who think that I am selfish for being ‚Äúsick & tired‚Äù of this world and want the LORD to come‚Äî well, I am not ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and I am occupying & sharing the Gospel to as many as GOD will open the door around me; But, I also am human and I am sick & tired of the world in which we live. Like the scripture states, Hope deferred make the heart   S I C K.  I have heard about the Rapture since my conversion in the early 70‚Äôs as a teen and there are times that I just say, Lord, when is enough, ENOUGH with YOU?  But, once again, I keep hearing JESUS‚Äô words (mark 11:22) HAVE FAITH IN GOD ( and, so I will until  death/RAPTURE).  I‚Äôm in this til it is over...no turning around and/or looking back for me. Some of you have encouraged & inspired me so much with your comments and I just want to say Thank you as well. I love you dearly.  Maybe our journey is almost over. See your sweet faces in the air SOON ENOUGH.

David Bento	Pastor JD,, You are such a blessing to so many! You are correct about voting this is the most important life changing mid term election in our lives..I believe God in HIS wisdom gives us a clue about this: Ecclesiastes 10:2   Even God warns us about the left fools..  1 As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer‚Äôs oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 2 A wise man‚Äôs heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left. 3 Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.‚Ä¶  Matthew 25:33 He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on His left...Hmmmm~ <><
Deborah Revell	I never would have listened to Pastor Farag or found him on you tube if it hadn't been for my ex husband cheating on me and laving me for that other woman.  the divorce caused me to move to Illinois where I have a friend. It was here in Illinois that I happened upon Pastor's  web casts.  I am so very blessed to have found him because I really did not know that I had to be saved by grace and not by works.  I owe Pastor so much.

Jonadab Sepulveda	Anti- semitism is prophesied in ;genesis 3:15"I will put enmity between thee and the woman,and between thy seed and her seed ,it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel" Galatians3:15"NOW to Abraham and his seed were the promise made.HE saith not,AND to seeds as many ;BUT as one ,and to thy seed which is CHRIST" This enmity will end after the end OF the MILLENNIAL REIGN of CHRIST,,then the GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT,in REVELATION 20:11-15,,,,,THE FINAL END OF SATAN.
Ritchie Bravo	Men are the only ones physically strong enuff to fight off those who prey upon the weak children are kidnapped and sold in to sex trade women are raped it doesn‚Äôt seem odd to me! What seems odd to me and most who patrol the border out of their own pockets understand something not said by the media or many people for that fact Mexicans and actual Latin country‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the ones actually coming here by majority it‚Äôs Muslims and Chinese what gets me is it isn‚Äôt hype about Muslims being in that groups there are a couple of we‚Äôll know terrorist in that groups they‚Äôve been captured on video fully decked out and no Chanel is saying anything about it but it is what it is it‚Äôs more than some bomber or some guy shooting up a church it‚Äôs the leave of immorality that has taken a choke hold on this country break the moral compass and you break the country and destroy it from the inside out once it rotts from the inside out its no longer any good
Susan Stanley	it's not just INVASION, but an all out ausalt on AMERICA
Heather Whilding	God bless you Pastor JD from Columbus, Ohio!  Thank you for preaching the truth and bringing the good news every week!
Andre Delage	You have the right to remain silent - not to vote in as much you believe that you are as powerless at stopping the rain from falling....  it doesn't make sense isn't it? ... so does not voting...
MrHotbulldozer	About the hair, moss doesen't grow on diamonds. About the jews, God is gathering the jews in Israel, therefor he allows bad things to happend to get the jews off their butts and go home. About the "doom and gloom", it is actually amazingly good news, our beloved is on the way! About the "caravan", it is a trojan horse, don't do our misstake and let them in, here in europe we now have walking tents everywhere and one can cut the hatered with knife that's spewing out from the slits in the tents. They are biding their time, when the order comes heads will start rolling. But even that is good news, everything is pointing to the return of the King of kings, Jesus our saviour!  Well now I need to shut up, just one last thing, stop holering! ;-) Blessings from the arctic circle in nothern sweden.
lynda	Please pray for Deborah and Bev's salvation.  Thank You!

TribulationSaints maranatha	it was obama's admin so yeah probably 2008
Lynn V	I like it when you raise your voice JD. It's for emphasis and shows passion. : )
Sonia Willats	INVASION SPONSORED by Soros's OPEN BORDERS? To quote John Lennon :"Nothing to Live or Die for; No religion too."
Cathie Z	Thank you, Pastor!   The attack at Squirrel Hill was absolutely demonic!   Even more distressing is the fact that so many so-called Christians spew anti-semitic garbage.  There is even a church in my tiny town that is boycotting all Israeli made merchandise.   Wonder what these folks will say to our Lord Jesus when they meet him, since he was born of a Jewish woman and all.............
George Alifrangis	Love always brother üôèüèºü§ôüèºüá¨üá∑üáÆüá±
Sara Purtill	hello from Australia, just thank you , everything is in reverse, the bad are called good, people whose hearts are cold progress forward, the preasure to leave the faith is so strong but they dont know how Christians have the Holy Spirit  and nothing can come against us. I cant wait to see all those abused children and trafficked people  rejoicing in Heaven and Our Lords arms around them
Tom Lemm	Please fix the audio scripting (the transcription at the bottom of the page) at 34:20.  Pastor JD does not say 'praise Allah' (he says 'Praise the Lord'), but that's what the text says.  It's gotta get fixed, please....
Shanti Khan	Thank you JD for this gift  for the last 12yrs in being the vessel that the Almighty has appointed to share and articulate the prophetic messages that has given us the confidence to prepare ourselves and not to panic .I look forward to this every week especially when I hear about happenings during the week which the social media's messages are demonic in nature.God bless you,your ministry and your family as you all are protected by the precious blood of Jesus, the captivator of our hearts.!!!!!
Laurel Schmitz	Why....why subtitles/closed captions is written , "project coming up know I praise Allah praise Allah I was going somewhere with  34:22/ 37:02...what the heck is that there for?
Mark Horr	Thanks Pastor JD! Again spot on, and in my opinion the most important topic for these days...not many churches are teaching as you  are doing!
Lori Tapscott	Thank you Pastor JD
Brenda Stephenson	The end message from JD, after he mentioned the movie, he said praise the Lord, but the words on the TV said praise Allah !!!!!!!my husband and I were shocked!!!
supermcwilliams	youtube strikes again at 34:20 Pastor Farag says praise the Lord, praise the Lord, but it is typed out praise Allah, praise Allah. A mistake? no way I don't but it this is clearly more attempts to subvert the Christian message of salvation.
Mr Wisdom	Boarders need to be protected and be closed off for our protection. We need to vote for a President that cares to do something about it. God sees everything and he is on our side in Jesus name! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩ
Alba de P√®rez	Thanks to Our Precious Lord for His beloved vigilant servants. I've been in strong battles for my health. I still want to serve him, but satan has tried time after time to stop my passion for Jes√∫s. Please join me in prayer. I always watch the on line Update and sermones. God bless you All.
*tygfr* *me*	Amen pastor....Yell !!!!! YELL!!! YELL !!!! Preach the truth ..preach the truth...preach the truth... We NEED THE TRUTH .... NO tickle the ear....thank u...!

Annette Castellanos	This is so true pastor thank you for sharing
Linda Dixon	May the Lord Jesus help, and guide, and watch over all I know and Love.  In Jesus Beautiful Name .Amen  Amen
Jim Day	America‚Äôs days ate numbered she-has  passed the point of no return. Chapter18 of the book of Revelation. A short reprieve   It is my opinion, America is in a place of a short stay before her complete destruction.  We will find out very shortly whether or not our reprieve will continue.  The agenda of the Republican Conservative party is not what will stop the demise of America. Our now President is God‚Äôs reprieve before her destruction. The reason why America‚Äôs days are numbered,  is the denominational conglomerate of religion. Men who are blessed with gifts of leadership among the Christian Church are the culprits.  Those who follow them will go into great tribulation. It is definitely the Church in America that needs to repent for dividing God‚Äôs people. While the Church goes about her business for the last seventy five years it is clear evidence against her. Let‚Äôs take a look:  Let us go back to 1920: prohibition in the the united States of America declared a nation wide ban on the production, importation, transport, and sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to December 5, 1933.  We had thirteen years of prohibition. While the American Church was slumbering, crime escalated because of the desire of those who took advantage of the situation.  The mafia controlled with the ability to bring caos to those who resisted. WHERE WAS THE AMERICAN CHURCH!  Roe vs wade was a land mark 1973
Davona Wilson	Praise YHWH on high!  All glory be to HIM for His mercy and righteousness!!  Thank you for allowing him to do wonderful things through you!
Patricia P	Thank you so very much for this update...i will be in prayer for you as you travel to help on this next movie!!!
Denny T	TO ALL WHO ARE HURTING AND DESPERATE - This is for you It has been said that when you have lost all hope, and all you see is darkness, always remember,‚Äù the darkest hour is just before dawn‚Äù. Don‚Äôt let your life be defined by desperation and hopelessness, Reach out to Jesus, He does His best work in dark places. Let the light of Christ shine within you. The very fact that you exist is God‚Äôs testimony of His love for you. Never Give Up. Receive Christ now, He is the caretaker of your soul. The Gospel message was created for you. The simplicity of the Gospel, - Here it is   A=Admit you are a sinner (Repent)   B=Believe Jesus is Lord   C=Call upon His name.  God Bless You Today.    AMEN John 3:16-17
Put Jesus First!!!	Although this started in Honduras. You have to know that as they started walking through other countries the other countries started following them. So now you have so many coming.  I know in Honduras its bad. They take children an kill them to sell their body parts on the black market. My heart goes out to these people.. But the thugs an murderers I do Not want in this country. I pray the ones who follow Jesus finds help an gets in someday but these people are just playing games an should not. It takes away from the ones who need help.   God is coming soon God knows every ones needs. No matter how many people make us mad. Be a Christian first pray for them to be saved an follow Jesus. Jesus loves each an every person ..  We as Americans do take for granted what God had Blessed us with. Keep serving the Lord He walks with us   He is coming Look Up
Learn Crochet By The Sea	You all may find this interesting in regard to the incident¬†in Pittsburgh. A friend shared this with me. There was an active shooter drill held not too long ago in Pittsburgh. Held where? At the Jewish Community Center!

Thank you Pastor J. D.¬†for all that you do. We appreciate you very much! Maranatha!
Jamie Schlemmer	I'm not of this world. I consider myself a kingdom citizen about my Father's business. Time's up. Rapture is imminent. Probably before the migration gets here, election day, or anything else earth dwellers are distracted with right now. Praying for the lost, those who will become tribulation saints, and standing armoured up with extra oil.  Maranatha! Love you!!!
Richard Rogers	Tyvm JD - Maranatha!
Suzanne Shassberger	I knew there was a reason I liked your updates. I was born 3/20/1963. We have something in common. God Bless You and your family as you boldly tell the truth of the Word. I recently shared the ABC's of salvation at my sister-in-laws  funeral.
amy erickson	Pastor....please see what the closed caption says that you said at the 34:27 mark! Wow... I am CERTAIN that you did NOT say "Praise Allah Praise Allah" but whoever typed your captions did...
Charles Martin	Thank you, you have become my new church ( pastor ). Im so glad you are preaching the truth and teaching prophecy, hard to find someone warning that the Lord is so near.
Jim Carter	I KEEP GETTING UNSUBSCRIBED TO CONSERVATIVE/RELIGIOUS SITES I SELECTED.
Amanda Spears	Invasion it is. I hope every American near that border will help hold their ground if they are able. But first I hope our military will hold our ground.
Janet Guy	J.D.:  I've watched you every week for years.  LOVE your updates.  Did you notice that in today's update between 34:17 and 34:22 the printing on the screen writes" Praise Allah .. Praise Allah" when YOU were saying Praise the Lord!!!  Just thought you would like to know.  Blessings to  you!  Janet Guy
Change4Good	Dear Pastor JD, my husband and I are always blessed by your teaching and insights. We love your passion for the Lord and for the church. Big THANK YOU from CANADA.
Diane Benker	I will be 68 this December, God willing.  I have seen many changes in my life, but I have NEVER seen this level of desperation and evil on the part of the left.  Doesn't that just show us how short time is now.  Satan knows his time is almost up.  This next 9 days is building unprecedented pressure. I believe you hit the nail on the head.  I don't think the outcome of this mid term election will change what is coming with it.  We may very well see the beginning of a civil war in our country.   Come quickly Lord Jesus, we are so ready to go home with you.
Michael Matthews	The birth pangs keep getting bigger and bigger.  Every day gets a little worse and worse.  There is no political solution.  If there was it would be in the bible.  The only hope is with Jesus.
pilotmom 975	God Bless you Pastor Farag üôèüèªüíú
P G	before he said it I was thinking how much more hair he had!
marcy overby	The first outbreak of violence after the18 elections.the quards should have bern called out and niped it in the butt. We play to much..Remember when Reagan did that on Berkley .both the quards and the police.. things sure got quite then.
Floyd Porter	‚úî
Theresa M	99.9% aren‚Äôt just men, but young men.
Stanley Ipkiss	Yup pastor is absolutely RIGHT!!! It really doenst matter who's wins God is still on the throne!!And the outcome is gonna be like no one has ever seen in history!!! And it's not looking good.
Maria Quinones	Dear Pastor J.D., FOR YOUR INFORMATION in case you didn't know!!! As we were watching your video, we notice that Google/YouTube translated your comments "Praise the Lord...Praise the Lord" (while clapping) into...wait for it .."praise allah...praise allah"  We couldn't hardly believe it! Outrageous!!!  Thank you for all you do and God Bless you, Sir!
misstheonlyme13	KEEP YELLING!! It's important! And it's frustrating.
jj foster	Thank you brother JD for another great update. Don't worry about the yelling, I'd be yelling too. God bless you and yours. Come Lord Jesus Come!
Nancy Anderson	I pray that our midterm elections go smoothly and that so much hatred, back-biting, and immature strife towards one another will be alleviated one way or the other!  It is very hard to feel safe when one goes out anywhere anymore, even just to the store.  Come Lord Jesus, maranatha!
Shari McLaughlin	Ty Pastor Farag... keeping my eyes on Jesus, can't wait. Longing to go home... Looking up.  Maranatha!!!!  xox
Natasha Wynn	I'm so thankful that you are on YouTube! You are amazing and I wish I could attend your church! I also consider you my pastor! I live in Florence, Alabama.
a guest	about a year and a half ago someone who had knowledge in government , un named, was putting out on social media warning people to get out of the United States now before what was coming happened.and look where we are right now. Great job pastor  and God Bless your parents and you and your family.This is a great update and needed.Will share with many.I always remember too God is in control no matter what happens. It is all leading to the return of our Messiah, Yahshua to end all evil and save his children who love him and believe in him. We look to him for our salvation.
Robin Thomas	from Maryland--but my heart is in Kaneohe with you all!! Thank you Pastor and Church for all you do!!
Kathy Grant	In the screen shot at 8 mins. I see only 3 women. Righteous indignation is completely understandable.  You reached me in Las Vegas, NV and I share sermons with my son all the time.  God continue to bless your ministry and our church family all over the earth.
Toni Olson	Knowing what we know it's kind of exciting to be a part of History rather I'm raptuted or God chooses to wait for a bit longer it makes me think of the day's when the Angel of the Lord announced that she was going to give birth to God's only begotten Son and when the Angel of Lord told Joseph of the occurrence that Mary was to be the mother of God's son that they were ruled by the Roman's. A bloody group of men who slaughtered babies as if were nothing. Now I am pretty sure that Joseph had a lot of questions for God however he took on the responsibility of keeping Ma safe in very ugly times. I have at many times laid in bed thinking about what she, Mary must have thought of during those nine months carrying God's son. Then the worst thing a woman could think of had to flee to Egypt because an Angel of the Lord told Joseph shortly after Mary gave birth that they were in danger. After Joseph and Mary left Jerusalem to go to Egypt not knowing when they would ever see their families again moved to Egypt. Why? Because King Herod went through all the land Ceasar placed him over to rule KILLED EVERY JEWISH CHILD ages two years to newborn be slaughtered, ripped from their fleeing Mothers arms. Because He, King Heord was going to be the only King of the Jews. So, God bless them they are not unfamiliar with the slaughter of their people. My heart aches in a way I can't describe. I'm so sorry this happened here in America. God have Mercy on the United States of America, God have mercy. I am stressed over this in the way some might be because Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior. I know I'm safe and will be taken care of. I wish everyone knew that peace that passeth all understanding. Because it's awesome.
Diana Moody	I remember what they said about Israel.
Karen Gates	JD  thank you so much God bless. Could you please look into the new election in Brazil,and what you think of them invading Venezuela and what may transpire if that happened? Just seems like that could really get bad.
Michael Dillon	JD It's not Yelling .... IT'S PASSION!!! God Love You, and we love you Our Dear Pastor.
SuZEQ	Thank you Pastor JD. There is such a heavy spiritual battle going on right now in all areas of life. I can sense and feel it. Its good to see that others are feeling the same way. God bless you. Your updates are a blessing
Nancy T.	Thank you J.D......I look forward to your updates every week.....Why aren't the churches talking about bible prophecy, and how it is lining up with what is going on today?.....Social justice, is  what I believe that they are ruled by.....No donations, no big salaries, etc....It  is up to us, the believers, to be the salt and the light to the world.....Time is short....Shout it out...Jesus saves!
Charlotte Rogers	Amen ! Beautiful truth as always. God bless you and this Church worldwide community !
Robin Goolsby	Malachi 3:5 And I will come near you for judgment; I will be a swift witness Against sorcerers, Against adulterers, Against perjurers, Against those who exploit wage earners and widows and orphans, And against those who turn away an alien‚Äî Because they do not fear Me,‚Äù Says the Lord of hosts.  We fear everything and everyone except for God. God is judging us for these things.   Proverbs 6:16-19 These six things the Lord hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government  Hands that shed innocent blood... And against those who turn away an alien... a proud look... we the people are providing just consent to these activities by believing in the american system of government for our life, liberty, and happiness ... a system of godless laws that has failed from the beginning. Your idol of laws will fail you and the flag that represents them will fall to the ground and be trampled. Repent and return to the Lord. I am praying for our nation.
Life Bread	Do not let your hearts be troubled, for all these things must come to pass. Trust Jesus and let Him be in control. We are only passing through this world, life is but a vapor, but Jesus and His Kingdom are Forever. Come Jesus and take your Kingdom, take us home Lord. I'm homesick more than ever before. Thank you Pastor JD
gryphon foo	It was the 2012 DNC, when 3 times they denied God and 3 times they denied the Capital of Israel, Jerusalem.
Bobby Goldman	Thank you PASTOR Farag for your prophecy update.  You are speaking revelation to the church.  Jesus come soon, even so come quickly.
Sharon Gygi	The timing of all this is very suspect.
David Sandell	I think the demoncrats removed God and Jerusalem in 2004. I could be wrong.

ChancetheCanine	Pastor JD like Pastor Jack Hibbs said at the conferance you were at, he said the rapute is so close, I am surprised we ae still here!!  :)
Lisa C	Pastor, you  are so spot on. You have confirmed to many of us what we all see and feel in our spirit. Either way, YES a turning point for the USA. It's not going to be well with our souls in which we will see, but our heavenly Father will shield us and deliver us. We will be by His feet, heads down, worshiping our Lord with such love unlike anything we have ever experienced.  God's love pouring out and in awe. You are so spot on. And stay the way you are. Dear to us all and you are so previous to the Lord.
MB 520	Keep yelling Pastor. If you were not passionate about bringing the truth of what is going on some may not listen. Thank you for all your hard work and study in delivering these updates every week
Kay Watson	J.D. You are so correct in all you are seeing that's happening in the country before the Election. We are nearing the Midnight Hour no doubt in my mind. Many in the Democrat Party are leaving it as they are seeing how it has been infiltrated by Communist agenda that is working to bring us into the Global Govt. (One World Govt).Proves how close we are to the Midnight Hour and seeing what's happening in Israel now. The Churches have been silent too long ignoring the times we are living in. Satan's time is short and he has really picked up speed. Look at the different issues that are used to bring our country and the President down. The Democrat Party went  crazy when Trump won the Presidency. Remember how all odds were against his winning. The Fake News (which are controlled by the Cabal too)-- everybody sneered and jeered how Trump would never be President. And against all Odds--But GOD-- God gave us Trump as President and answered our prayers. It's been one headache after another ever since. Stormy Daniels, Christine Ford attacking Judge Kavanaugh with their lies which was proven, Fake bombs, killing Jews in PA., and now the the Invasion of 14,00 illegals trying to get into the U.S. They are believed to be here before the Election as Democrats plan to get their votes. Which would be illegal any way but Democrats don't respect the Law. They have become a  Law unto themselves. Then we hear the Media putting Christians down as we aren't caring about the so called Refugees, which they aren't and we have nothing against immigrants but our system has a  system as how you become a legal immigrant. All countries have Borders and you can't just in to other countries and take over but the Media feels we should allow it Forget the Liberal Media, they serve Satan along with George Soros who is financing all this violence and upheaval.  And you are so right about the Democratic Party removing God and Jerusalem from their platform. Pray more of them will wake up and remove themselves from that Party. Republic Party has problems with the RINOS but we know what the Party stands for that's how rump got elected. Thank God he's not a Politician and speaks like the everyday person that's blunt;; but he tells it like it is and people respect him for it. When foreigners don't respect our Borders, we have no choice but to build a Wall. J.D. is right; no matter win or lose--America is facing some suffering time.. Already had Voting fraud in TX. and problems there. There is no end to what Satan will do to destroy our nation. We know God is still in control BUT have we left Him out of godly living so long that He now says "Enough." The Weather pattern too seems like God is trying to get out attention to draw us back to Him. Never in History have we has so much so frequently and such intensity as now-- world wide not just here.CA. burning, Hurricanes, Typhoons, volcanoes, landslides, sink holes. tornadoes, etc. People-- wake up.
BROTHER IN CHRIST SIMPLE MAN	Pastor JD. GOD BLESS YOU  JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON  JESUS CHRIST IS KING OF KINGS  JESUS CHRIST IS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR

Ruth Samaroo	Shalom church family in the USA. I live in the Caribbean and I am filled with grief and pain as i watch what is going on in your country, espcially the attacks on your president, a man who openly supports israel. This is spiritual warefare. Please pray and fast and pull down these strongholds.  Our enemy is seeking to devour God's people. I am praying for you. We are on the winning side. Shalom.
Jamie Lane	Very good sermon

Ellie Holmes	Hi Pastor Farag! From Indiana!
Born4 Redemption Binns	God is still going to call from a cloud. It's still the 70 th year, it's past the 120th Jubilee and scriptures cannot be broken. Election may not come to pass even. All that vitriol is preparing for the Red horse killing spree of lunatics in a dark awakening.
Sherry	So much hatred and darkness in the world today and what gets me is nobody even sees it?! God be with us this election day because I fear it's not going to be the outcome we think it will be. Also my brothers and sisters in Christ; please lift up my family that the scales on their eyes are removed and please pray for me as I try so hard to walk a good Christian walk amongst the wolves that embark me all around..I'm feeling so lost right now.

Mary Mclocke	+JD Farag --That was the 2012 Dem Convention where they held votes to *remove God and Jerusalem*  The "ayes" actually had it, but the guy at the podium said that the vote was NO.. I watched that mess live. I was so disgusted!  I'll never forget it.      Pray without ceasing.....Watching the skies for our *Blessed Hope* , our Lord, our Savior, our King!     \o/
Richard Hendrix	Watchman from Houston,TX and I love it when you Yell ,so go ahead  and let it out.
Shafawn G	The globalists want the US invaded just like the way the EU is invaded.  Because strong independent nations simply will not submit to NWO.  And if we refuse to submit I bet they organize either our bombing or our economic collapse or both. Assassinate -  I pray every morning and every night and I have seen literally thousands of posts saying the same thing... many many many Christians are praying for President Trump.   The left is going to do whatever they are going to do... I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees to them.   Either way I am praying day and night and staying in the Word of God every day.    God is not up there wringing HIS hands worrying for us and He doesn't want us worried and wringing our hands either.  We are well able and on THAT day I want to be busy doing the Lord's WILL full of hope and faith.   Love you in Christ.
Stanley Guyer	Brother their is something not quit right about the Caravan being mostly Men as everyone can see I see the making of an assault against the US border very      dangerous in fact looking like if violence does take place they have mostly all men of military age that is most disturbing to me as what that many men can do damage wise even if they never get armed but they can by themselves do a lot of damage to this country that could also encourage  others to take up their        cause as fellow Spanish speaking people in this country and else where in this country located in other cities in America could join them in a concerted effort to damage or cause chaos in this country where others might be waiting to attack or assault this country in many other cities located near or next to objectives that could cripple certain infrastructures vital to our country operational functions cause a possible martial law to try and get a handle on violence that will happen anything is possible Keep an eye on this developing situation.
His Song	Agree. No matter outcome of election God is in control. The sheep and the goat, l believe, are now to be separated & God is in control. Stand firm brothers & sisters. Know God. Keep lamps full.
77ulrike	Thank. you for having the courage and the spiritual wisdom to speak out as you have tonight.  ..I am seeing the same things you have just spoken about. As an activist from the 70s, it is obvious to me that the demonstrations and self-righteous  behaviour and violence being practiced by both politicians and so-called feminists are professionally organized and paid for.  There is nothing sincere or organic about this.  Psalm 2 comes to mind every time I watch the news:  "The nations rage and the peoples plot in vain"
Shannon Elam	Thank you for sharing pictures of your family Pastor JD. I feel what your Mom said at the time was very true. I'm thankful to know Jesus. I'm from Chicago and lived in New York and Germany before 1983. At the time nobody had another's faith on thier mind's before being civil one to another. We appreciated what different ethnicities brought together to get along, work hard and raise our kids in peace. Violence and hatred diminish the trust for humanity's kindness towards one another. The same has been known to breakdown every once great civilization.  Once the whole world is embroiled in lawlessness, there will be no hope. Hope deferred makes the heart sick. There is not a day that goes by the heaviness of what I know and see truly enforces my personal longing not to be here in this world. I will need God's Strength, not my own and patience till He let's me go home. I'm not expecting true Joy this side of Heaven. That changed when the knowledge of how many Christian's have been purposely persecuted with the knowledge of Western Civilization choosing yes to the decision. I don't feel any better than them just because of my location in  the US.  The book of John tells us who has the powers in this world. Job is the lesson on everything being able to be taken except his Faith. His life is kinda like ours as Christian's except in Heaven what we suffer here will not compare to the plans that God has laid up for His Own. The Lord will wipe away the tears from our faces. Mine are stained and after the Lord Jesus wipes away the tears I know unspeakable Joy will take the place on the faces also the heart's and soul's of man. I Pray for the Body of Christ around the world and Jerusalem's Peace, in Christ Jesus name. Amen, Thank you very much Lord for Pastor JD and his family. God have mercy on America, Please !!!
Mary Bailey	This is the most absolute truthful video you have ever done. Bless you for your forthright honesty.

forgiven 81	i want to share something. my uncle killed his father my grandfather  when he was 16 years old, i was a little baby. his father was`nt acsactly a nice guy, i`m not saying it was right but i can understand it, please don`t misunderstand that. anyway i never thought this would happen but last week he went to a churchmeeting for his first time ever. this is what happened: a woman who was suppose to be a christian went up on stage and took the microphone and said: " all of us here have lied once or more in our lives, but atleast we have`nt killed someone". my uncle left ofcourse and i don`t think he will ever go to church again. i`m asking you, as many as possible, please pray for my uncle that Jesus will touch his heart anyway and that this woman is`nt  gonna be aloud to ruin this. i think he was there for a reason. i`m just sad how it ended. please pray for him. and that woman to because this is not right. forgive my bad english i`m from Norway.

Marilyn Desrosiers	Those bombs were a product of the left themselves. I trust in God, so this doesn't frighten me. But as usual the left  disgusts me. I am so tired of them and their idiocy.

Blessed Hope	Pastor JD, I live in Arizona!  As a single woman this scares the heck out of me.  I PRAY that POTUS stops this INVASION!!!!!  May the LORD take us all home soon!  I am prepared for whatever may come.  This is a great conversation for me and my neighbors.  Lock and load.  We wont go down without a fight.  We will protect our neighborhood, woman and children.  The MEN will stand and PROTECT us!  Please pray for us BORDER STATES in the crosshairs!  We are basically on the front lines.  My beloved attack dog will not go silently into the night.  Maranatha!  Oh dear PRECIOUS LORD, PLEEEEEASE take us out of this evil satanically driven insanity .   I see LAWLESSNESS first hand.  I work in RETAIL and thieves are raping the merchandise off of our shelves.  They have no shame, it is blatant right in our faces, in front of us.  God told us that lawlessness will abound.  These things GRIEVE my heart and puts much stress on me.  I weep and PRAY OFTEN as I am driving my almost dead vehicle, held by spit and glue to get me to work but also to keep evil away.  We are having incidences of 4 to 5 thieving incidences a day.  So stressful.  So grievous.  IF this thieving activity everyday is at my store I imagine it is RAMPANT everywhere!  It's bad, so bad.  I want to GO HOME!!!!  YES, MARANTHA!!!!  X a TRILLION!  God Bless, I keep you all in prayers my brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus.  One more thing, I feel a deep GROANING in my spirit.  How close are we?  So CLOSE!  God Bless us all!  Jesus, take us HOME!  Please!
John Hansen	I like it when you yell, it shows your passion for our Lord and savior, Jesus.
Marcat	Imagine the rapture and all of our Christian leaders are suddenly gone. No President or Vice president, all Christians in office, Christian policemen, servicemen, ... coming soon. Bo, Yeshua, bo.
Lucy Romero	Hello, I watch you all the time you're my favorite Pastor that preaches the truth hard to find nowadays. This is going to sound crazy, I was given the gift of seer, open visions. Jesus told me to write a book it's published. I put it out for free on Facebook. It's called The Gift of visions by the grace of God, scriptures unsealed, by Daniel Steele. It's also being sold on Amazon, didn't do it for money. In my first Vision as an infant, reoccurring dream. I was shown on the rapture timing, not day or hour. But in this dream the rapture happened while their was major protesting and violence All Over America. Most all the other Visions, we're open visions, Wide Awake. I am the least of the least, no friends, no family, but close to the Lord, be blessed and keep doing what you're doing you're awesome, Daniel...
Kiwi Girl	The END time is coming!

Becca R	I am blessed to hear you share prophecy, sermons and Bible study every week. I do ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to a local church but sense it is not concerned about what is truly happening in the world. I watch for all your uploads with anticipation and end with a renewed strength and growth in knowledge. Thank you to your congregation for sharing you with your online congregation. God‚Äôs blessings to you, your family, your congregation and our online congregation! God‚Äôs peace and love be with you all.
Hebrews 12:29	Many Canadians will not be sober-minded.
Cathy Kaplan	President Trump is supposed to declassify some documents to show the world  how many  laws the left and some right have broken. Then major arrests will happen. Martial law will be declared to keep the peace. Will all this happen, only God knows and as you said He's still on the throne.
Chris C	Yell all you want JD. My stinging ears are hearing!
Walter Debnam	I know JD, a lot of things coming. Thank you for always, always encouraging us all to draw closer to Jesus and let His Spirit in us flow out to everyone around us. The Living Water! Our days are in the hand of the Lord. You and your family and the gifts and ministry God has given you are continually in our prayers dear brother JD. Maranatha, from we watchmen in Washington state, Seattle area. A place almost as left as California. Not quite yet though. Looking for our Lord's return for us. Blessings in Jesus Name.
Michelle Setterstrom	You are my online pastor. I so look forward to your sermons on YT. I have turned a lot of folks on to you for your delivery and ability to resonate with people. I adore you and your church. I, too, wish I could ne INSIDE your church. Im in MN. I know you have a life, but I would so love it if you were to preach and post daily! God bless and keep you, your family and congregation. I feel part of them. Youve helped simplify how I can witness to others.
David Melvin	God Bless you Brother Farag for standing fast, preaching the Gospel, and clearly interpreting the signs of the times.  May your ministry continue to reach the world in the hours before the arrival of our King.
wensdae williams	Pastor JD, your program is my weekly church. I feel full of the word and Gods need for me when your at the end of your sermon. I live in Chicago, but your sermon is again my church. I love your prophetic teaching. God bless you JD.
Debra Harper	Close all Borders until the wall is built.  Send all military to defend the building of the wall. Trespassers will be shot.
djfg1938	Whatever happens in the election it won't surprise God.  Christians need to be salt ad pray & vote.  But if we lose, maybe we need persecution to bring about an awakening in the House of God,  1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
Pam Showe	I have a local church in my community.. You are my second church. God bless!!!
Sally  Idol	I see it pastor! I see the satanic  hatred intensifying. I hope Jesus comes soon, don't know how much more of this evil world I can take. It is so hard for me just to be here the evil is trying their best to start the chaos, that we all know is coming! It is a darkness You can feel!
ndksmkegk	it was 2012
E. Dykes	Rev. Farag,  Thank you for preaching the Truth!  This is not found in most churches today, and we  desperately need more like you.  God be with you as you try to wake up people in this awful, sinful world.  God bless you richly!
JR Christlove	God's in control. We know persecution is coming. Love God with everything you have! Hallelujah!

Betty DeMars	It was revealed on Fox News TV this past week by one of their guests (who knows what is going on in the background) that there was a planned assassination on Pres. Donald Trump on one of his recent foreign trips, with plans revealed by the secret service on the ground, and attempt was thwarted. This was only ONE attempt on his life. There have been several attempts, but most are not revealed and kept quiet.  The Dems want to kill him!  Pray for America and pray for our president, his family and his administration.  Be sure to vote RED and be prepared for chaos if we win the senate & house.  Pray against witches/demons/evil  spirits that are being sent towards us by the deep state.  God is on His throne and He sees what is going on.  Soon, and very soon, I feel we are flying off and away from  this wickedness.  Luke 21:36---pray always that you may be found worthy to escape the wrath & tribulation that is to come and to stand before Jesus and give an accounting.   Maranatha, brothers & sisters.  GOD BLESS.
Larry Scott	You can take all the time you want. Congratulations on your movie opportunity, The coming convergence was awesome. My wife and I feel everything you said today is correct. Do you think it's possible that the Church is some how connected psychically as well as spiritually? Or maybe it's as simple as we all follow the news and study prophecy and are just adding 2+2. Bless you all and break a leg in Hollywood.
derito56	In a way, it is good that there are mostly men in the caravan. Easier to turn away men than women and children.
Denise Fetter	Thank you Pastor Jd!!
Luke 2128	‚Ä† Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual  wickedness in high places. - - Ephesians 6:11-12
richard segura	JD, my father was an immigrant from the Philippines, he became an American citizen, joined the navy afterwards settling in Alaska in 1925... would not teach me the island language or Spanish....I ask him why? He answered....because your an American, you will speak English period...he knew more about the history of America than most professors teaching today...period. Very sad. Thank you brother for your words of wisdom and peaceüòé
Beverly Bangasan	If the Democrats losses they will go more angrier, more demonic and more volatile. I agree jd pastor still God in control
deborahcabness	Thank you Pastor JD!!!
Belinda Jobe	As you said, "It can happen (the rapture) at any time"..... my phone alarm went off and scared the daylights out of me lol!! I am  just imagining the super loud sound of the trumpet blast!!!!
Carolina Umana	Oh Mrs JD Farag... please don‚Äôt  be angry at your husband for yelling! I love it when he gets passionate about a subject...it makes it come alive and I think it‚Äôs appropriate so please forgive him‚ÄºÔ∏è
Tracey Rodenbach	Satan knows his time is short- I‚Äôm so ready to go home. Yell all you want, Pastor JD- it‚Äôs passion in Christ- and you‚Äôre giving voice to what we‚Äôre all feeling.
Dan and Barb Morones	Was watching a Fox News program this morning, and one of the guests on the show indicated that US/world is ready for a leader who will bring peace.  I believe that is true.  Unfortunately (or fortunately for the Bride), I believe it will be the anti-Christ.  We are ready.  Jesus, come for your Bride.  *** UPDATE *** I may have misspoke, but I think the idea is correct in what was said by the woman on the panel at around 25:41 in the link below.  Liz states she believes this country is ready for a politician who will be a "healer" and bring unity to this country.  The anti-Christ will be just that - right?  And I understand the US is NOT the center of prophesy, but it is going to take nothing short of a miracle to bring this country to some level of sanity.  That will probably not happen, and once the US falls (which I think will be very soon not matter if Republicans hold/gain seats in the House or Senate), then Israel loses its only ally.  JD reminds us regularly that like a tachometer, events are revving up and will continue in very rapid succession.  Come, Lord Jesus, come...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5PXbaVQFMQ&feature=youtu.be
Daniela born again	Amen, and Maranatha...100 percent agreement with everything you said......I believe the same. Demonic forces have been unleashed in this country like never before. Europe is already gone........but America is reaping what it has sown. around 60 million plus abortions will not be forgotten, and the Obama years ushered in unprecedented open celebration of perversion and wickedness.
Karen Dobrowolski	The attack on the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a shock to all of us who live here! Squirrel Hill has long been an area where the Jewish community has gravitated to for living and worship. We all know that. There, to my knowledge, has never been any issues between the Jews and non-Jews. My own aunt worked for, fell in love with and then married a Jewish store owner from there. She, even though a Gentile, was accepted by the society all the shop owners were a part of.  So, when this shooting occurred, it was the last thing any one living there, or around the greater Pittsburgh area, expected. Somewhere else, maybe; here never! Please pray for the families who have been so devastated on their loss and the shooter may some way find Jesus!
VICKI CARTER	I honestly believe the mail bombs were a political stunt by the democrats to get votes just as the caravan of potential invaders are.  No matter who wins the control of the house and senate, the attack on Christians and Jews will continue to get worse because Satan knows his time is short.  He is the driving force behind all of this evil.  False doctrines and false teachers are becoming more prevalent.  As Christians, we need to be vigilant and know the word of God for ourselves.  If you don‚Äôt, you will believe the false teachings.  I am thankful for Pastor Farag and Pastor Jack Hibbs‚Äô ministry along with Amir Tsarfati‚Äôs middle eastern updates.  We all must seek a closer relationship with Jesus and remain sheltered under His wings.  Times are only going to get tougher; stand strong and trust Jesus for His guidance.  Shalom!
Marilyn Derochie	Amenüôèüèªüíö
R Scott	Israel and Jesus. absolutely correct.  this election is so important. won't change the hate the world has for them but winning the midterm is vital for the fight to keep the evil at bay
Carol Cole	J. D., you can yell at the top of your lungs !  People who can talk about the End Times and the things that are happening around our world and NOT yell, are dead spiritually !  Of course, if they have actual hearing problems, they are welcome to just adjust the speaker somewhat.  But, for the most part..........yell, J.D., yell !  ‚ú°Ô∏è  ‚úùÔ∏è. üëÜüèª
Malcolm Gilbert	I totally agree with you brother J.D., regarding impacting Jews and Christians. How can God bless a nation that approves same sex marriage and abortion, and where racial hatred is rife?
karen putteet	your church has touched me I watch every week I wanna thank you Pastor JD for your updates an info may every one be blessed
Amaranth Avalon	Antisemitism in the United States has existed for centuries. In the United States, most Jewish community relations agencies distinguish between antisemitism, measured in terms of attitudes and behaviors; and the security and status of American Jews, measured by specific incidents. Antisemitic incidents have been on a generally decreasing trend in the last century consistent with a general reduction of socially sanctioned racism in the United States, especially since World War II and the Civil Rights Movement. Cultural changes from the 1960s onward into the 21st century have caused a large shift in general attitudes such that, in recent years, most Americans surveyed express positive viewpoints regarding Jews. An ABC News report in 2007 recounted that about 6% of Americans reported some feelings of prejudice against Jews. According to surveys by the Anti-Defamation League in 2011, antisemitism is rejected by clear majorities of Americans, with 64% of them lauding Jews' cultural contributions to the nation in 2011, but still a minority holding hateful views of Jews remain, with 19% of Americans supporting the antisemitic canard that Jews co-control Wall Street. Holocaust denial has also only been a fringe phenomenon in recent years; As of April 2018 96% of Americans believe the Holocaust occurred.     Hate crimes   Private residence (22%)   College Campus (7%)   Jewish Institution / School (11%)   Non-Jewish School (12%)   Public area (35%)   Private Building / Area (12%)   Cemetery (1%) The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) published in April 2014 an audit of antisemitic incidents occurring the previous year, with the results finding a decline of 19% for 2013 as part of an about a decade-long slide in attacks. 751 incidents were reported across the U.S., made up of 31 physical assaults, 315 incidents of vandalism, and 405 cases of harassment.[93]  In April 2015, ADL published its 2014 audit of antisemitic incidents. According to it, 912 such incidents took place across the U.S. during 2014. This represented a 21% rise from the year before. 513 incidents were classified as "[h]arassments, threats and events". 35% of the vandalism incidents occurred in public areas. A review of the results showed that during operation Protective Edge there was a significant increase in the number of antisemitic incidents, compared to the rest of the year. As usual, the highest totals of antisemitic incidents were found in states where there is a large Jewish population: New York State ‚Äì 231 incidents, California ‚Äì 184 incidents, New Jersey ‚Äì 107 incidents, Florida ‚Äì 70 incidents. In all these states, more antisemitic incidents were counted in 2014 than in the previous year.[94]  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) organizes Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) designed to collect and evaluate statistics of offenses committed in the U.S. For 2014, 1,140 victims of anti-religious hate crimes were listed, of which 56.8% were motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish biases. 15,494 law enforcement agencies contributed to the UCR analysis.
Marlene Hager	This sermon was so moving.  Thank you Pastor J.D.  I can feel Jesus' presence so near, even at the door.
Valerie Mearns	Can't wait to meet you in Heaven Pastor JD.
virgil dolph	Jesus said to me, 4 weeks ago while I was talking with Him, ‚ÄúThe people will look upon this time as the calm before the storm‚Äù.  As much chaos as we see in our nation and the world now, this is calm.  People do not understand what IS coming.  The unsaved and lukewarm have NO clue.  Work while we still have light.
Cassie Thornburg	Oh pastor, my pastor my TODAY  be the day we hear that trumpet!
koiesbow	Funny they don't cause attention to the 9000 instances of Democrats hating Republicans and draw the light to this one Republican who somehow mailed bombs to people states away from himself and how the post office forgot to post stamp them all. That line of men headed to the USA through Mexico. We gonna have our own little Gaza Strip of lawless ones we gonna have to be shooting at here in order to keep MS13 thugs from coming into our country killing our kids and raping our women.
IssMein Fehrrad	Not 'doom and gloom'. Rev 13 is going to happen. Rev 18 is GOING to happen. There's only one way they can happen, and that is if Satan is empowered. SO THEN....we will not win this Earthly battle. We will overcome it!  But the world will be left to the unsaved. 'GOODBYE!" I say!

Tango Foxtrot	The mexicon president stated yesterday, that those people heading our way, TURNED DOWN HIS OFFER, JOB, TEMP SHELTER..AND MEDICAL STATEMENT AS THEY WERE PRESSING FORWARD TO MAKE THEIR POLITICAL STATEMENT. Exactly how  do they have a basis for a political statement?  rofl they do not, this is an invasion.. Based on law and the fact that they were offered jobs, shelter..etc.. and turned it down..we now can turn every single one of them away.  PUT OUT MILITARY ON THE BORDER NOW. https://www.pressherald.com/2018/10/27/migrants-turn-down-offer-of-asylum-in-mexico/
Jan Hafling	First one here!  Love your updates, Pastor JD!

Pro-Trump, Pro-Israel, hoping to meet y'all in the air soon.  Edit: I do also attend local church however, just got officially recognized as a member today in fact. Get involved locally people!
Teresa Bayouth	My Sitti became a us citizen in 1920 or 1921 and walked into one of our family‚Äôs grocery stores waiving the American Flag with tears coming down her face because she was so proud to be a citizen.

God's Roadmap to the End	Hello, family in Christ! Thanks for sharing the encouraging video! I would like to return your kindness and share the video below with you - if you have not seen it already. Ken Peters was given a very profound prophecy in 2015 which is pointing to this week before us! If you have not seen it yet, then I encourage you to please watch the second video listed below - our Lord is coming back and there is no more time remaining!!  ‚Äã The Deal of the Century is going to be shared with Israel this week as well and it would seem that this could present an opportunity for the fulfillment of 1 Thes. 5:3.  I hope these bless you and look forward to meeting you in the air!  https://youtu.be/I91WVnHAFiA https://youtu.be/bsavlt7pfR8

Allison Tipton	My Sunday school teacher and I were talking this morning about the world and the synagogue shooting, and I said "stop the world.  I want to get off!"

Stop the world, I want to get off.
