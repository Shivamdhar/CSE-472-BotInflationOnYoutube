Viktor Kulasenkov	Believers, go to Revelacionesmarianas.com and click English. You'll find a lot of answers on your questions.
Martin Mulherin	The funny thing about this... I live 30 min away from this facility, and there has been little to no mention locally about the incident.
Running from Chaos	So this and Hanford in WA stare just after DJT announced end to nuclear treaty with the Ruskies. Hmmm.  Just a thought...

Damien Lusk	I've been subbed for a long time and I stopped getting notifications until the notification I got for this video. I thought Dahboo77 took a break until clicked on the home page and realized there are videos almost daily. Wonder why I stopped getting notifications?
Harrybigballz1 2suckitbitch	Is it a leak ...they need to warn people or they can be and should be criminally charged if indeed that's the case hope not though .

803 Mastiff	This is another strange facility. Whenever.you get.inthe area of a facility like this you get.the creeps even when your not aware a place as such.
atanacio villegas	suspicions were raised about¬†a vehicle in the parking lot of the administration building.  The security event at Pantex has ended without incident," the agency said in a tweet which thanked law enforcement for their assistance.
Larry Doss	Pantex came under heavy criticism¬† in 1985¬† in a Documentary movie called "The Plutonium Express". Good luck finding that movie¬† now.....It was full of interviews of Pantex employees who were fearful of a terror attack and theft of plutonium triggers ( "PITS") that were stored there in Amarillo.
Debbie S.	Apparently no big deal. Plant is always under upmost security. Go here: http://www.newschannel10.com/2018/10/23/pantex-declares-unexpected-security-event-ends-without-incident/

B Brunson	Past inspections of this plant has been dismal.  The past inspectors have stated that they don‚Äôt know why the plant has not exploded yet.  Please move this ... plant to a lonely Pacific island.  Right?
Lone Villain	new vid check it !!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mux2ZgWhx3M
sj sharksfan	Thanks for the report Dahboo, eyes open!
Android Orangutan	I hope all nuclear sites have those emergency procedures in place an ready at moments notice, especially with the earthquakes going on now.
jacob Schock	DAHBOO77 can you find out anything on the fair fax shooting that took place this tuesday evening? I have no other way to get ahold of tou
Cuttingthruthefog	Pantex has a great ERO...the town and the plant are very well coordinated, because Pantex decomissions nuclear bombs. An operational emergency is one of 3 levels...and they aren't required to notify the public unless there is a threat outside of the plant boundaries. So they DID notify the public, but since they are a major terrorist target zone, they probably have to lock it all down in order to know if it's accidental or intentional. The best guess? A theft of high level nuclear material salvaged from the bombs or the triggers.
dexterdave54	I live in Amarillo, Dahboo, and I hadn't heard a thing. Can't imagine what's going on.

Andy M	Democrats using their inside knowledge to possibly destabilize the country and create  problems...... they know how to bring this country down they been planning  for years 20 at least.... if not more... if things don't go their way they will burn the house down .. civility will be restore only if the Democrats win ..... anybody remembers who said that??.....be ready....things are about to get ugly after election days. GOD BLESS.
Byron Maltimore	Dahboo, I'm wondering if you could do a video and breakdown Revelation 6:8, "So I looked, and behold, a pale horse (Could this be Comet 46P/Wirtanen that is coming this December?). And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth (NATO allies?), to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth."  Thanks!
Diane Whitlock	Thanks for this important update!
dantuy ghte	Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!  Are you serious?  Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!  Are you seriously serious?  Oh my fucking shity God
Ben Ferraiuolo	Amarillo? I just recently talked about the 4.0 quake that hit near there. People said they heard a boom first and then the quake happened, which is quite odd. Now this? What the hell is going on?
Bob Lewicki	This isn't good but I think it's another false flag but you have to consider the people we are up against. Peace stay visual. May God keep us safe.
J.e Woodard	Do you think it's wise to name the location of our facilities with so many TERRORIST on this country?

Jackie Welsh	My daughter lives there
Dallas Kennedy	I feel so bad for homeless people and as they continue to destroy this planet, Earth, our home I began to understand more that homelessness is an issue that affects us all... This is our home and we need to protect it and stop acting like guests..
Kathleen Sisco	I would consider this in the same catagory as the astronomy telescope situation as I believe we are experiencing more cosmic rays and UV with perhaps increasing the radioactivity of existing earth gases.
Truth seeker	What's really going on?
Paul M	just reported here in the uk
Mark and Pam Angelo	Trump probably borrowed a bomb to stop the "caravan".
Macrov Endure	Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt publish about this location to the world.
Andrew Gohring	Response to invader caravan.

Rick Simpson	Basically every Nuclear Power Plant,, is a nuclear arms manufacturer,,. A nuclear power plant does over half the work of making a nuclear warhead or bomb,,,. And they generally make over 1, million dollars a day worth of electric too ,,. So when you flip that switch you're making them rich and giving them the capabilities to end all life on Earth,,,. !!!  by the way all four of those nuclear reactors in Japan has melted deep deep down into the Earth there's no recovering those fuel rods,,,. !!!  And the government has secretly raised the amount of radiation that can be in the food the water,, and in your body,,,  in the majority of all the radiation detectors in every state is not working for has been turned off,,. ???
Angela Hite	Any correlation with the earthquake recently?
wolvenwood	to all who live nearby: get your iodine tablets, it will help greatly to reduce effects of any radiation you might be absorbing. My guess is Deep State attack of the plant and Patriots are fighting it off.
Doll Empire Club	Getting ready for the caravan attack
White Stone	lay all the nuclear waste at the border, between US And mexico!!!

Kathy Carver	I'm not on Twitter. But I watch all of your videos. Please post updated info about this on your YouTube page? TU!
A Team	thats got to be a huge underground base,   if it was really bad they would have made it a evacuation,  so this must be a radiation leak of some kind in pipes or containers,
Gretchen Joy Hackett	Are they going to bomb the caravan?
Just for Fun	Is there going to be a terrorist attack at that place?
StephenT	Local news reported that the incident has ended and the all clear has been given. They still haven't said what happened though.

cassanoa	could be anything - probably a deep state effort to compromise some weapons now that their access to the military is being denied - they went for the source - i dont know how many men guard this location but its over whelming - with reserves on call - not to worry
Danny Cashmore	üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ how can you thumbs down this vid?
Waterlily 2017	It's actually by Panhandle, TX, a very small town between Amarillo and Pampa. Years ago I noticed just how many people in that town got sick and died of cancer and I think it has to do with that plant. Way too many people for such a small town.
Faith Everylasting	Wait is this a nuclear power plant or a nuclear weapons facility? They are two diiferent things. And I really don't think they be telling you anything if it was a nuclear weapons facility. That would be top secret to the public. By the way it would take more 2 people. I believe your talking about a nuclear power plant. Someone probably forget to do lock out and tag procedure.

I love u all brothers and sisters, Jesus loves u even more, dying paying the ultimate sacrifice, that we may live ETERNALLY W HIM IN PARADISE!!! 2 Corinthians Ch.10 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Ephesians Ch.6 10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. GOD BLESS YOU ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
