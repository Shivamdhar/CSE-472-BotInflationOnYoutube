John Bostick	QUESTION:  If you have little tech skill, i.e. don't use command prompt to solve issues, how do you set up a Bitcoin Node?  I have the hardware (a computer with plenty of disk space) and downloaded the Bitcoin block chain but could not get the node to work, I think the problem was getting my home machine to be a static ip.  At least I think that was the issue.  I am pretty sure it had to do with my internet connection not talking back to the block chain.  I spent a lot of time on the Bitcoin Core website looking at posts and I am pretty sure it is the internet ip that is the problem.  I could not find any solution simple enough for my tech neophyte brain to handle. I know that nodes are critical to the infrastructure of Bitcoin and other crypto and if you want to be more than a sideline investor and you are a true believer, which I am, you want to help and be a part of the infrastructure.  The problem is it seems there is no "black box" solution I can buy on Amazon that will set up a node and solve any connection issues.  I am surprised this has not been built.  If it has please tell us about it.  If not please help.   :)
Thomas Grainger	Don't they pull out the voting rules and hard code the softfork results?
Peeticek Peet	Strange.. i always thought that the speed limit for the initial download is the upload capabilities of 8 public nodes that provide the whole data package to mine node..
Aaron Walter	Invest in FGC Fantasy Gold A real use case in fantasy and esports.
Coin Cabin	Forget Bitcoin, get some FGC (Fantasy Gold), real use and way better project!
BEND JOZZ	good and useful videos don't miss
Absilon	Crypto markets should trade against stablecoins not btc/eth. It makes a lot more sense. By the way, my favorite crypto is FGC. It's one of a very few cryptos with a real world use.
Nachannachle	Wow, thank you for the explanation.  Blockchain technology in Bitcoin is REALLY amazing.
TeslaKaniv	The bandwidth your peers are sending blocks can be a bottleneck too. Another nitpick - it is the latency (in msec) of a hard drive or SSD that matter, not bandwidth (in MB/sec) as such.
Присяжный Засидатель	@sequentialvsion
nion456789	Smashed the like
Michael Jack	Wow
Nixon Rexzile	Wow now i know! I thought I knew everything but Andrea keep feeding me info on Bitcoin :)
Joe Miller	How does a node know to emulate soft forks in the protocol for specific blocks? Is that hard coded into the node implementation? Isn't the definition of a soft fork that it is backwards compatible so why does this have to happen? I assume that the blocks are not marked with a software version because there is no one version of bitcoin software as it is a protocol.
Buysome Bitcoin	Can it be used for time travel? Sounds cool!
dajosova	so... why being a node matters ?
Chancellor Crypto	That's where some forks have their own enhancements. Bitcore has a blockchain size ~950 mb, and a blocksize 10MB/20MB SegWit
Cory Kanski	Are bootstrapped appliance-like machines safe? Isn't that route skipping a lot of what was just mentioned? I'm surprised there's a market for them
Lachlan Greenbank	Lookup how to write a config file for your node. you can crank up the ram to 8gb+ if you have it available. I wish I knew that the first time. Really speeds it up.
FukU2222	I got into ETH back in early 2017 and had no problem DL'ing/syncing blockchain - I then foolishly thought I had to have my chain sync'd to make a transaction and thought I was SoL (pressed for time) because it wouldn't DL/Sync up.  Make sure you have a decent hard drive, don't want that shit bricking on you//unable to keep up with rest of chain. Solid state(s) is/are a great choice, much cheaper now days too than when I first built this PoS, lmao.... Cheers Andreas.
R	always a pleasure learning from you @aantonop! thanks
