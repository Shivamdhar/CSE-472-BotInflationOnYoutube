Human Being	Frick off
Dat man	Mercy trash now
;-;Branden;-;	Jeff, I‚Äôd like to take some of your time if you even read the comments that are related to mercy. She revived a rework because she needed to hide to use Rez. Think about he dps hero‚Äôs, most the time reaper will hide to use ult, mccree and junkrat are big examples. And please stop putting too much into the esports, new content in the game will be better and beneficial for the game
Frappelychee	Wait but Bungie had these spectator reply stuff in Halo Reach! üò± Maybe you guys can take a look at their code for inspiration? üòÖ
Kizamuto	Genki needs a buff his skills are being nerfed too many times to count.
Roky Fort	papa Jeff  Brigette is broken
Gheetah	so its like fortnite's replay
River Vilchik	We need overwatch for mobile device! You have phones, right?
Revolto ShadowMaster	Manama jeff
Mega2Shanez	Are the buffs to reaper and roadhog really buffs regarding the spread? I've seen blamethecontrollers video on it and I want to confirm with blizzard if the demonstration is how it works. I really would rather do more consent damage like I initially thought then to deal less overall as seen from the video. Thank you for reading if you get the chance to, I just don't wanna see 2 of my favorite characters become less viable than they already are
Jonny Kash	The next overwatch character should have a pet

lily1212	Fortnite replay mode?
oszaszi	Nobody freaking cares about the stupid overwatch worldcup... we would like to play this stupid game but you keep focusing on OWL for money instead of reworking how your stupid shop works so that you have constant money and try focusing on the game development. NOBODY wanted you to make the OWL so early in game development. You made it because you were stupid enough to not make a money generating ingame shop. You fuked yourself up, you dont listen to suggestions and your focus in developing as at a tottaly wrong spot... Good job. I can gladly say if there are any new players that would be introduced to Overwatch, Overwatch is the game t hat would make them not want to touch games ever again. Shame. Shame of gaming. This is what you have became after winning the award of best game... you got so much support and suggestions from people for social features for character development and so much more, but you just straigt ingore it... wish you all the best for the future.

IT WOULD HONOR MY ANCESTORS COUNTRY. PS! NOT I BADGUY IF I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT MATES. BUT SERIOUSLY NOT A BAD GUY LIKE MOIRA OR WIDOWMAKER.
Gaming4fake	Make a film/series
Michael Turner	Back in late July early August. I watched all of the Overwatch League finals. If you watch them on Twitch and have your account linked to your Blizzard account (which I did) then you would unlock a series of sprays in Overwatch. That never happened and every time I contacted Blizzard Customer Support I got constantly told "There's a problem on our end and our engineers are working on a fix" This went on for weeks and then they just all of a sudden said "Sorry nothing we can do" Also in August I attempted to purchase the Genji Special All Star Skin. For some reason I was unable to and when I contacted customer support they just said "Oh it must be your fault we can't help you sorry" I even talked to a Manager Andrew C and he couldn't have been more dismissive of my issue or treat me in any way other then trying to get me to shut up and go away. Blizzard I love Overwatch it's one of my favorite games. One of the major reasons I play is because I love collecting all the cosmetic items. Your dumpster fire of a customer service department has left a sour taste in my mouth and I cannot justify spending any more money on Blizzard Entertainment products knowing this is the sort of treatment I will receive.
Itchlord	Here's an idea: a control map based on the world cup, where the image you see on your menu screen if you open overwatch as I am writing this is the point. That would look awesome IMO
Rostislav Ha≈°ek	What about optimisation for AMD gpus? Vega 64 performs significantly worse than GTX 1080 which is not the case in other games.
Katherine Rose	Hey developer can you make some Bastion products cuz they'll be really nice if you can since you add some of your characters in the game
Red Queen	Too much focus on OWL. The game needs attention. We need new events. We need new play styles or game modes. The game needs something or it will die IMO.
C.Q Cumber	Hey Jeff I know you just took mercy‚Äôs healing from 50-60 but that‚Äôs not good enough. Why could you do this to poor mercy I will FIGHT FOR MERCY....  1 like = 1 pray for our beloved mercy üò©üòî
the best brather toxic big ever	Where is the update ?????!!*
sasuke 3011	Buff rez

Buddie	This is so Great! I Appreciate you guys working on this game to give us this experience¬†that is called Overwatch!  Thank you for everything you do. Because of¬†you, I've met so many friends. Thank you!
threjewer	The Overwatch World Cup viewer will allow select people to have seats in the cup. That‚Äôs right you will fly to California and sit in the trophy until it is won
ÌïúÏÇ∞Ï≤ú	Can You Creat VR Viewer?
Lancelot	Finally a buff for Mercy. X)
Lil puddin9312	The whole reason why roadhog was debuffed was because of the community being sad boi all the time. Boooo
Evan Young	When the 29th hero comes out i bet it will be Jeff Kaplan, i mean he should‚Äôve been the *first* hero
Adam Horv√°t	Mercy buffs? In my Overwatch? Unheard of!
kkrsTw189	I hope overwatch dies
Obito Kinobi	Can't wait, This feature should also be implemented in SC2
Neo Cortex	very nice. i don't know why many people complain here about that feature, i was waiting for a spectatormode for 2 years. Exciting! Anyway, since you put so much effort on esports, keep working on making the game more competetive, as you already did with symm/torb changes. I hope you will add a few moer heroes that are exciting to watch, like all the heroes that have outplay potential: tracer, genji, ana. I honestly don't know what the game needs right now, all the casual players are upset for no content and like heroes like brigitte etc. and most of the competetive players are most likley very excited about the changes and hate heroes like brigitte. in my opinion you did one thing wrong i noticed since the start, you tried to built up a competetive game, that satisfies casual players on pc and console and also doesn't get competetive players bored/annoyed. that's almost a contradiction. good luck on achiving that... i hope you come up with some genius ideas.

ObiwanMchighground	Jeff PLEASE fix the competitive system in overwatch I‚Äôve been playing a couple of games in competitive and my WiFi lags out and then I get suspended then after a couple more time of the happening I get banned I think it‚Äôs an annoying system how you get banded basically cause you have bad WiFi just please fix this problem soon thanks üëç
Logan Arnold	It is worth noting that fortnite already has a viewer that allows you to watch vods, and they have started adding weekly tournaments to encourage esports IN GAME. Overwatch is playing major catchup and will probably die if it doesnt make sone changes soon.
Berdy Sierra	Remember when overwatch was good :(
Pr√¶tor	"Imagine being able to revisit your matches and see everything in slow motion, first person..." You mean what Epic Games did?    ...Fourteen years ago?
Hazmatx220	What a boring update video -_-

Calvin Fernandez	I would play this game a lot more if there was more cosmetic updates. Anybody else agree?       Just me then...noted
Pomkin the Worst Warlock in Azeroth	BUFF MERCY PLZ BUFF LUCIO PLZ NERF TANKS PLZ
Mortal Gamer472	Can you just buff Mei already
Pj Loughlin	When you watch the video in battle.net app, you cannot give it a thumbs up. Thanks for the update.
Michael Harrop	imagine a game like Glory from "the kings's avatar" but made as OW.
Jacob Gibbs	Sym mains rejoice!
AxEIA Filletheking08	Got an update on ps4 for 28 gb, wtf
Ninja Guy	Jeff pls do thet lot boxes from event will give you more event skins then normal couse i opend like 23 lotboxes from the start of the halloween event and i have get just one event legendary and  like 4 normal legendary
Paul Petru Alexandru Cazacliu	:) Most of the players aren't playing just 1 multiplayer game, so OW isn't losing to the Battle Royale genre. Personally besides Overwatch constantly Dirty Bomb, Paladins, the new City Battle/Virtual Earth and Mass Effect Andromeda Multiplayer and that's giving to each of them a longer life. If you are playing just one you'll be bored to the death very soon but if there's variation the life span is multiplied by each other game added.
Teachna	"A welcome change to the hero" Yeah no
Tedi Bear	jeff pls make ressurect to ultimate again. We all want this
Norbert Veres	thx for torbj√∂rn no armor give nerf..
Kelsie MW	Overwatch was fun but i guess they are money hungry, ignoring players constructive criticism and just doing what they like. I guess once they lose a lot of the player base then they will listen really    shameful
dosduros	When you cant fix brigutte and you decide to keep people as spectators :D.   Replays and live watch is actually dope.
Edvin Eriksson	Give sym 6 weaker turrets and her old photon barrier back because new torb is just a better version of symmetra. It would be cool If her shield generator came back as her ult. Or that symmetra becomes the shield generator. Please blizzard I miss old symmetra
Isaac Garcia	Thanks dad
XxFiveHead xX	delete doomfist, junkrat, BRIGITTE and mei and boom...overwatch is a good game
Orcaking 44	I just want winter mystery back for the winter wonderland event
Ivan Ivanov	That's like the biggest feature the released ever! And this is definitely the best one! Thanks, Dad!
Kawaii Pyromancer	Hello!
Phetus Boi	Why tf are they buffing sym?
Afterthought	Is there anything in this update for those that don't care about esports?
Jesse Rea	Worst developer update yet.. what's the point in focusing your attention on making the game " easier to watch " when you're losing the playerbase required to watch it in the first place?
Eicke Ehlert	This with the Rewatch sound Awesome
Johnny	I don't know why but this system oddly reminds of the same system COD had in their games back in the day when they actually had it in the game. It actually is practically the same as what you're explaining Jeff. Good stuff I'm pretty pumped for this epic feature in the near future!
Qulzey	Why am im not geting legendary skins for new event???????? Like Im playing for 3 hours per day but still i didnt get any new skin for this event. In past events I was getting around 2 or 3 new event skins now 0. BUFFFFFF ITTTTTTTTTT
Ndi phonse	Flip flop mercy
Vega Vega	OW is a console game for me, so guess I'll wait for this spectator update. xD
What are you looking at	Welcome to overwatch update,  *we GONNA BE NERFING MERCY*
Tiny Tiny	You wont believe that overwatch has been....     You just got trolled hahahahahah  Edit:copy and to friends.
JustBelowAverage	Jeff : hi we‚Äôre gonna nerf mercy another 6 times and buff Brigitte because tracer mains annoy me.
Roro Girl	Nerffff brigitte pleaasseee üò≠üò≠
HaveMercy OnMe	Buff Mercy more.
Minesonic	What about those ways to get Sombra's Demon Hunter skin in 2019?
stegosaurus	so when will you be removing brigitte?
XStyledNinja	Symmetra still plays slow as F#ck. The new teleport is just a gimmick. And give her more turrets so she can cover a wider range. Her turrets already gets destroyed rather easy.  And this mercy buff is a joke. So now mercy players can fly more often and still feel boring to play. Well whoopty freakin ' doo.
Miss Support	Everyone here that‚Äôs upset about mercy: just take out your pistol and pew pew the enemy. It‚Äôs all she‚Äôs good for anyway.
Austin Brister	Hey what are you guys going to do about the copyright that epic games has done on over watch?
R√∏bert whitehead	Nobody cares about the world cup though. these people play on different patches .. we want more maps and heros and skins
Parker Trzaskawka	My gamer tag is DadJOKES353 I play on Xbox

Dylan Du Toit	I wonder if Moira has new abilities and an ultimate ability
GABX P	Experimenting with Valkyrie, boi it‚Äôs literally the same as it was before pre nerf
Bro videogaming	OIE! BLIZZARD! FIX THE "STAY AS TEAM FUNCTION!" ON XBOXONE! (Ahem, sorry for caps...)  Also, this update seems cool as when your bored and dont wanna play OW, you can do all of this!
Lucht S	yawn
Tetsuo Jensen	Is the feature going to be paid? Like "World Cup Ticket".
Christian Brunswick	If you don't have a major expansion this game is gonna die .
MachoDingus	As a Roadhog main, Please please please don't break him further. The only thing really wrong with him is the fact that half of the heroes in the game can break off his hook.
Brad revelle	Thanks Jeff
Matthew Gaither	Quick, take a shot everytime Jeff says the word "watch"!  *dies from alcohol poisoning*
Cheesus Crust	Being an avid Support player, I'll be very interested to see what changes are made for Mercy.
Brendan Murrell	Why have the World Cup Viewer on the battle.net client, instead of in the actual Overwatch game?
Grant Rants	Maybe a cool new feature could be to go in third person mode?
raharu000	Man, Overwatch World Cup is so cool, look at those teams working together like a well oiled machine, makes me wanna play comp. Enter solo queue, 5 dps all flanking no one touches the point fml.

SpyroZ	OMG no Mercy nerf
Valkia	Been wanting that replay feature for a lonnnnng time! Not only to watch plays, but create content/frag movies
Peter Zeng	Can you add new modes
Fate Hater994	Nothing about the bull-guard anti virus blocking the new patch
Random Extra account	there is a third feature, if someone seems like they are glitching the game, you can use it to check them out and then see if they are hacking or cheating or none
Melissa Way	BUFFED??? MERCY???? 2 words never said in the same sentence
yaoyao „ÄÇ	nerf doomfist plz says from gm healer mainüôÇ
CWX487	Jeff keep blinkingüòÇ
Brute912	Just switch to Battleborn with your friends. Dump this Overwatch game already. Battleborn got PVP AND PVE.
nathaniel cascini	I'm super excited about this new feature, especially for when it comes to regular overwatch.  When it comes to OWL, I will finally have a reason to watch OWL.  I don't feel like I can learn anything from players I like by watching it in its current form, so I don't watch it.
Wraithy	God I wish this game was not dead
holynova15	*mercy mains shaking when they click on the video*
SuperiorPegasus Fox	Give mercy two pistols
VeryB	nerf brig pls
Logan L	so literally just reverted the healing per sec on valk... and let it charge faster... lmao
Scott	I hate this guy. He talks as if he is one of us "gamers". But in actuality, he makes 6 figures a year and couldn't care less of what we think.
Daxdleader	how do you sign up for ptr?
Jamie Hayes	I‚Äôve wanted the spectator in the game client since the game literally came out
X6 Ria ow fan	I hope overwatch long time  play i happy play game,  love overwatch
GoldWildFire	why do we need overwatch 2 if we can get everything from just the game itself with update patches.
kamacost	Thanks daddy Jeff! <3
xXNovaOwOXx ironicOwO	Jeff: *makes a small revert to mercy that undoes an unnecessary change in the first place*  Everyone else: a buff!  *illision 100*
TheVislo	I hope its new competitive rewards PLEASE!
Caleb Ervinmar	I would have bet anything that viewer thing wouldn't be an option. That's super cool.
GamBit -	Hey everyone developer update. We are completely removing Brigitte, Moira and Hammond so the game is slightly fair again
freshbakedmeme	I kinda wish they'd just remove Mercy with how many people are complaining.
SubFlow22	Still not paying for that $50 Sombra skin.
SilverFox3546	what I really want to know is when roughly is map editior going to be announced and will you be able to suggest your own map to blizzard and then they check the map and see 1 is it appropriate 2 will they post it on the game itself????
fancydeeldo fafa	hey jeff how are you
Aksel Borntrager	plz add the world cup skins availavlible  for  Xbox, PS4, and P.C  plz i want American Genji
Kilikclia	He said no new map, but nothing about not a new hero üò≥
marshalljwatson	And this is why I don‚Äôt play overwatch anymore üòÇ
Doggo	Heck Sym.
Poly	Mercy Changes: We think there are too many people playing mercy right now so we are taking her out of the champion pool for people over the age of 16. So that should be a lot of F.U.N
cirro stratus	Help fix rank or make it vibrant
Leonard L. Church	Y'know I am always excited no matter what just when you post one of these Mr. Kaplan
Josh francis	....remember when they buffed torb when no one was asking for it?
The Waffle	3:32 yes i can, i play rocket league. This feature has been in the game since launch.
Luke Du Plessis	Alright that's pretty cool
Th√©o BENHABILES	his hands omg
Ryzuk	when will this patch come out ?
Carson Culbreath	Please stop. Symetra doesn't need buffs. Please just stop
Christophe Dumont	are you steve carell brother ?
sophia karpoev	*prays the mercy buff will be actually good*
zach smith	Jeff stop shitting on us console players we have it bad enough as it is.
SmartCheat	pero mierda te pasa ? buffeo a sym? estas en pedo o que te pasa?
Magister Of Steam	0:05-0:12... where is Jeff from the Overwatch team????????
Morning Coffee	Pc Players... ooof $60 and $60 year of ps plus isn‚Äôt enough.
Josephi Krakowski	Now I cant kill zenyatta while he's being pocketed by mercy as winston    Good game Jeff
EvilVoche	Immediately guessed correctly what the Overwatch World Cup Viewer would be once he said the name. Why am I not working at Blizzard? We're basically on the same wavelength.
JacketFoster	They better be making it so the hook finally debuffs people to take more damage when hooked.  That buff has been a long time coming, and it would make the damage nerf the scarpgun ate slightly forgivable.
Owan Smith	How is there not an Overwatch movie or TV series? They would make millions of of that idea
Zisuh	Nerf briggite like she stuns me every two seconds when I'm playing reaper. Reapers ultimate needs a buff tbh that's the main thing. Stuns and shields cancel it too easily
Flex	hey blizzard,  Bungie already did this with halo 3, you know, ten years ago. So bragging about how one day youll have the technology to replay isnt anything to brag about
MarluxiaVI	Did you also get rid of the old capture the flag maps? I just feel like its the same three maps lately. what happened to the variants of Nepal and Oasis? Lijang night market is also missing I think.
Adrian Vance	I love you Jeff
Hanzo Weeb	Just give roadhog his 2016 hook and wake me up when overwatch is on the switch  Ps: Jeff pls nerf event loot boxes there hurting my bank account and my feelings
–°–æ–±–æ–ª–µ–≤ –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π	Add some sounds to Mei's footsteps, please.

Username34	6:12 for the buffs
Al M.	stop suggesting me these videos... I quit this game like 4 months ago because of unbalanced heroes
Curious	make overwatch 3
Max Varela	ALWAYS PC NEVER CONSOLE
Hatsune Miku	Pc players LUL. Soon as he said that instantly clicked out of the video.
Lucia Finstra	Your servers are still garbage, and your balancing is fickle at best. You can do better!
Mark	what do we need more than buff for reaper???
Tim Moss	Full disappointment from this.
Maaike2356	Watching the entire world cup from JJonak's perspective here
Criticorn	Nonono, you didn't buff Mercy, you gave her back her healing per second while using her ultimate, there is a difference, Jeff
Skunk Squad	hi papa jeff
Klaphood	DEADLOCK PLZZ
Ray P.	Papa Jeff, come on! What's the deal with not giving console any love?!!  Not cool.
The Robot Devil	Father makes a triumphant return.
Satya Vaswani	6:31 - So in effect what Jeff is telling us is that if someone steal $100 off me i'm supposed to be happy if I get a dollar back apart from roadhog, symm & reaper (i.e. all but one) it's not a buff it's a half-assed revert which will not fix any of the problems
Jessica Parker	nobody cares about esports lmao make a good game instead lmao balance your game instead lmao
Merlina Kay	FIX YOUR SERVERS.

Zundrium	THE REPLAY FEATURE! YEES!!! Wanting this since launch, finally able to salt with solid foundations!
pipsqueak677	THEY NEED TO GIVE SYMMETRA HER LOCK ON BEAM BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
Rick Mahnn	Hey Jeff. You should have NEVER nerfed widow into the ground. The hook CD should be 6 seconds, and for every person out there that complained she was "too op". ur just scrubs that never understood the dive metas could take her out easily, regardless.
Sam Hayes	Where is Dinoflask?
kristou Ahmed	how to ruin a game ? ask Jeff rip overwatch
Mateus Nicolini Bezerra	Why is it taking so long for new comics to be released?
Ricky	Don't care about a new map. Don't care about a new hero.  The game needs a major overhaul. I'm talking story mode and raids.  If we don't get an announcement similar to that, then I'm uninstalling and never looking at the game again.
Moggie Mai	Deemed awesome
Rick Pardo	Resume of the update: mercy is getting a buff later this year.  your welcome, I just save 8 minutes of your time
Radostina Stoyanova	Make Moira scream as banshee plssss
Indie In The Blood	and this is the reason I stopped playing! Esports focus is killing me! i used to play 8 plus hours a day! now maybe 1 hour per week! didnt get the things fixed that needed to be and focused on esports more! RIP overwatch! sad times as I really loved this game

Havu	Onlywatch is back
BeingofEvil	half video about some boring feature... spectating games in client, whoa, dota 2 had this for ages, congratulation about this phenomenal feature! maybe now fix reconnecting system in hots. roadhog ok, but do something with mc cree, his win rate is not right, give him more sustain or smth and soldier needs some rmb buff.
Tazmanian66devil	Overwatch is so trash.... hasnt been fun since season 5
WoWiS	I'm here to see if they finally did something to bring me back to Overwatch but they obviously don't care about the normies anymore   It's almost like they don't want us to play it anymore, just watch it
Mads Grode	havent we already seen this (CS:GO)?
Icy Blade	Overwatch is still a thing? Ah I forgot.
ritchie brown	Buffed reaper...... b u f f e d r e a p e r ......BUFFED REAPER......B U F F E D R E A P E R
Dakota Collis	when are they gonna stop shoving the pro leagues down our throats and actually start focusing more on improving the experience for the average player
JacktheamazingTeen091	Did anyone else thought that this was the announcement of the new hero for a split second?
Bo Andersen	Hope to see an official Overwatch API, like you have for StarCraft :)
Patrick Mercader	Leak: Mercy no longer heals but rather slows down allied characters, this will bring a new playstyle that will  encourage players to play differently. Rez has also been brought back to the total number of fallen team mates but to make it balanced we made the channel time one dissconect with a 50% chance to rejoin the match.
KomeeDonitsi	We want jetpack cat!
loZer	REMOVE BRIGITTE!!!!
Tony Stark	until we get a role que system im not playing tank or support anymore..i will be dps instalock number 6 from now on just like the teams i always get im gonna main sombra only and stay invisable 90 percent of the time and hack people from time to time
Tahj	Can you guys decrease the amount of health that dude can use?!?! üò©üò©
Daniel Dean	Why did he stop saying "hi im jeff from the overwatch team"? Im so upset
Jesus Espaillat	CROOS PLAY NOW!!! PLZ
Patricio Empar√°n	still waiting for the scum browser
Jake G	I imagine they wouldn't want a hero to be lost in the mix either
Shafu	Love this update
Lorad	No. Stop with the maps.
Moe Nasri	While rien still waiting for any type of buffs
David C.	Pls just... PLS DON'T BUFF SYMMETRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SqaR	Mercy buff *Triggered*
laith E	BLIZZARD PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT OVERWATCH WORLD CUP OR OWL GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEADS FFS FIX THE GAME AND ADD GOOD EVENTS INSTEAD OF REPEATING THE SAME THING AS LAST YEAR
Your∆ä–Ñ∆õ∆¨”á 311	MAKE A PVE GAME MOD
BOLTV	games dead 4-7 min queue times for QP or Comp usually........
Jack Riley	No lie but the game needs attention rn it‚Äôs stale and getting boring, some hero‚Äôs deal far too much damage and the healers don‚Äôt make the cut anymore, the cosmetic system is stupid and needs a update, get your priorities right blizzard please I play overwatch like once a month now I use to play everyday!
Did You Expect Something Original?	Jeff, me, you, and everyone else knows that Mercy doesn't need another nerf... If it IS a buff, if the ult isn't a D.va nuke but a healing explosion, then I will be disappointed
chris dood	this douche sounds just like mr vandreesen from beavis and butthead
Pasquale Pingitore	Road hog getting a buff???!!! Really??? He‚Äôs already a one man army
Christopher Menz	Oasis is mediocre and blizz world is garbage. That‚Äòs why nobody cared.
Diana Nananana	A mercy buff? I'm surprised blizzard saw the light... The latest nerfs really made her so unreliable as a healer. Hope the valk buff improves her utility.
Sumashu	Why tf did you make mercy op again? like shes better than in season 10 now where she was extremely broken
Karol gajda	please give Polish character like seba
Rouge Nargacuga - Gaming & More!	Papa jeff
Amethyst Rose	You can see him almost throw up in his mouth when he said mercy buff
YouVSMeTV	4:30 minutes talking about a system which has been available for other games for nearly a decade. -how about detailed stats on kills, deaths, ult charge, heat maps etc. -how about a movie browser in the game so you can see the cinematics and comics? -how about more lore updates and not just voice lines to tell a story? -how about story based episodes of the main cast telling their story like the battle of eichenwald, or winstons escape from the moon? -how about tweaking the endorsement system to be more easily understood and also add an endorsement for negative behavior that can only be seen by the player?  No, you won't do this guys. You're too busy fighting "toxicity" and nerfing mercy. I'm over overwatch.
Chrioni Sta Ana	There will be no Diablo 4 announcement at blizcon üò•üò•
Eli Dikkers	*sigh*
Halil Mucaram	Same as Dota?
Bonewulfe	I'm not watching the world cup. I'm mostly worried about the 8 cues splitting all the players. More then 2 minutes in a cue to finally get into the tail end of a game just to get the last minute exp before being dumped back into cue at 0s. Every time I think about playing Overwatch I remember how hard it is to find a game of Overwatch to actually play.   I uninstalled yesterday, what reason do you have for me to reinstall? The world cup? More reworks? I know there won't be shorter cues
Frame 6 production	Make doomfist low tier again I like a real challenge
MajinE.N.D	A new hero?
Sharky	KAPLAN IS BACKüëèüëèüëè
Dai P	bring back the scatter Arrow just make the spread Riders when you shoot it on the ground it doesn't actually hit anyone
Hilman Hazazi	MERCY MAIN. YOU GOT BUFF
apocalypseap	Hey can you remove distance damage falloff from McCree? Thank you.
Scrumpy	DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NEW VIEWER THING? WE CAN MAKE OVERWATCH MACHINIMAS!!
Caleb Davis	This is probably the coolest update yet. No joke.
Tedious One	It's called go TV
Sophie Power	I have to say, as an (ex) Mercy main, I sort of sweated a little bit XD
Reiko Vallerie	I feel like blizzcon is going to be an enormous disappointment...
Sebastiaan Sillis	Maybe fix the meta to less OP hero's and tons of bugs instead of adding a certain feature that doesnt interest many people
MOHAMED X_17	7:48 Beware headphone users
Zoe.dnb	O no. Mercy is in a identity crisis again
Scribble	Jeff for H28
Vellocet	Remember the battle mercy meta on PTR when they first put valk in the game.  bring those times back
BUDA20	AT least!, that spectator feature is a must have!.
Feueroger	If I watch OWWC through the World Cup Viewer, can I listen to the twitch-cast in real time too?
Musoko	*hears buffs for sym and mercy* I‚Äôm leaving this game, never coming back
Dob Rozner	Yes, I can imagine it, because I was doing it in Halo 3 over ten years ago lol.
Imban3z	Could you rework your 'rework' of Rein's Shatter. You managed to rework it oblivion. I am standing behind walls, carts and still getting stunned. It's all over the place
You‚Äôre Green	Fix Reinhardt
Simon Carroll	balance changes suck. Mercy's hps in valk is not enough. it should be 60hps overall. and or higher in valk -_-
Jon Sharvin	Change widow maker right now I mean it
Deniz Cem Kaya	overwatch is a pay once type of game (honestly who even buys lootboxes) that has a very demanding community and is in constant development. e-sports stage gives them opportunities to earn money and show their game, so it‚Äôs understandable why they care this much about it. I look forward to reaper buff but mercy really doesnt need buffs as long as she has res.
Silly The Pumpkin King	Can we have text chat on console like the PC does please
IONIX	Sym should be getting nerfed not buffed
NCG-JSG-JMG	Sooooo...... just like fortnite‚Äôs gameplay reply?
Jcriptobeta	Overwatch in a nutshell: What is actually adding content lol lets change mercy for the 4th time anyway watch our sport please
Ollie Bartlett	YEA BOIS WE GOT NEW SKINS AND THE SAME BORING EVENT!!!!!!!!!
Joohker	I REALLY want a highlight system were i can share highlights with my friends, and it would also be cool i i could you know use the same system you use in the world cup viewer in my highlight, so i can you know fly around and stuff so i'm not just limited to watching my view  But i really think we need some more things to do in overwatch, like a new gamemode, like 2v2, personally i would really like a 2v2 or just some other fun gamemode
dudewithout acoolname	MERCY MAINS ITS OK YOU CAN COME OUT OF HIDING NOW
Beneteus der graue Wolf	Fix Mercy? Finaly give us back Mass Res and a propper E ability?
Harok9	Casual bullshit, meanwhile we still waiting for your long promised "long term changes" for ranked... urgh owl still gets pumped with the ressources we need.. the rent was over over ranked, but suddenly came a back up for a bit. im suprised they still baiting all the normies.
GreedyChip	Bring mercy back. please
Swampy948	‚ÄúUsing this limited World Cup viewer will help us get the technology for a replay‚Äù completely ignoring that Heroes of the Storm and other various games have working replay systems lol. Cmon guys.
Wind ManV3	So put all the effort into something that people don't really care about, and no effort at all put into a new map, hero, bug fixes, quality of life changes, potential buffs for other characters, etc.?  Yeah, that sounds like the usual, typical Overwatch update and development cycle.  How about fixing Ranked? Listening to valid feedback? No? Despite the game being made by an AAA company and the game being $60? No?  Okay then...
LieMintPyon	can they just nerf brig to the ground already? nobody loves getting smacked and bashed by brig while she doesnt get any drawbacks from doing that also buffing mercy heals back to 60/s, really? aerial pharmercy oppression is back while ground bashing girl is still left uncheck
Hunter	No offense but fortnite already have replay system
VOID gaming	WHO IS THAT AN WHICH TEAM IS HE ON ;_;
Andrew Taylor	Delete coonfist from the game
Max de Sousa	Mercy buff... Mercy nerf... Mercy nerf... Mercy nerf... Mercy buff... Mercy nerf... Mercy rework... Mercy nerf... Mercy nerf so deep you can see what she ate for breakfast... Mercy buff
TJM Matthews29	what why only the PC players get these special events first and then they get this? can‚Äôt y‚Äôall make it available for console fore Xbox1 and Ps4?, no new maps? or characters yet?, let‚Äôs see the Junker Town Queen to compete with Junkrat and the other heroes of the game one day, and please fix the lootbox system items the way they drop randomly
Rhys Clement-Evans	Great update. I really like the way that Jeff talks to the community. Looking forward to the replay feature, that is going to be so useful.
talal	While it's a really cool feature, are we going to be able to listen to the casters or it's going to be gameplay audio only?
Ninerz 415	Is Jeff drunk? And do people still play this game?
TikTok Daily	They‚Äôre buffing symetra. You Serious
geekette studio	All I can hear are the fellow mercy main screaming with join XD
Cutshrimp 81448	Make hanzo normal again!!!!! >:(
Silver Soul	Why buff sym and mercy go fuckyourself jeff you ruined this game
Wang Alex	I feel scared every time I see Jeff‚Ä¶ think about what if my mains get nerf
Mista Misz 2	I don't care about the overwatch league. Please keep balancing game, and give us new modes. Game getting stale. A guild system, level editor, new modes, competitive TDM, more balance fixes (Sombra, Moira and the stunning/cc are a little OP), etc is needed.
lol	Looking forward to Roadhog's buff!
xX_SOGEN_Xx	Yeah I can imagine watching my matches later on with infinite camera controls. Halo 3 had this ten years ago.
JWatchCraft	Can you start paying attention to the events that this game has? It's getting a bit annoying doing the same old events 3 times in a row. Add new gamemodes for the next one and the next ones after please.
Yhojan Alberto Ram√≠rez Sequeira	Took two years and half for this to be on Beta...
dekumutant	my name jeff
jacob bonicamp	right after blops4 comes out. Stupid
Henrik Hempel	I thought he said: Mercy and Roadhog are disgusting
Bear Jew	I love overwatch with all my heart but it is dying and no one can denie that
falsesetto	i can hear jeff struggling to say "mercy buff"  edit: what the hecc 200 likes-
Lena Miaou	Dear Jeff,  Bring back Tracer please.  Regards,  Lena
Mimikyu‚Äôs Life	Let‚Äôs not be to excited about the buffs to these heroes, because they‚Äôll all get nerfed back down anyway :/
Dullmoments	Good Developer update! Jeff seems super excited about what is going to be revealed at Blizzcon. I think they are going to be releasing a new hero; he was a bit cheeky about saying "We are not going to be releasing.......a new map" I think we were expecting him to say "We are not going to be releasing.....a new hero".
Adam Trinidad	Console player here, feeling like the 3rd wheel again.
Not Visible	We want overwatch content..not skins, not twitch content... Map, events, new ways to play. Not last year's stuff and a new map with a Halloween theme
Apples	So they, nerf and buff, nerf and buff the same heroes again just to buff them again? Mercy alone has been fixed like 3 times already... wtf
Honest Dix	I just wish United Nation Of Overwatch Voice Actor Panel 2018 have more than 9 casts like 15 or something.I have prediction for cast will be appear that panel for my perspective: 1.Darin De Paul 2.Cara Theobold 3.Crispin Freeman 4.Lucie Pohl 5.Keith Ferguson 6.Matthew Mercer 7.Jonny Cruz 8.Carolina Ravassa 9.Charlet Chung 10.Cherrelle Skeete 11.Genevieve O'Reilly 12.Feodor Chin 13.Dolya Gavanski 14.Matilda Smedius 15.Jonathan Lipow
Sam Torstensson	Anyone think this was a new hero?
Anime Dimension	Overwatch is dying dont @ me
Douglas Cavalcanti	Mercy finally getting the BIG REZ!! She's been dead for too long. :D
Choukri Affane	CS GO came out with this "technology" a while ago. Ironically it has the same name XD
Chris Walters	It's not a Mercy buff. It's a partial un-nerf. I'm waiting for them to make Mercy fun to play again. I've been waiting for this basically since the rework. Super Jump is fun and all, but that's about it these days.
AnalogFlame	CS GO already did this
MeatManTV	What about the Reinhardt animation lock bug? Or people simply 'hopping' over Earthshatter when they're in direct contact with it? Are these not bugs?
Polaroid	@dinoflask
hej san	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE CARES
X Arias	Yay Mercy buffüòÄüòÅ
Red	Brace yourselves for pro players complaining about the new mercy
elijah Davila	My favourite part about this video is that it looks like someone else photoshopped their own hands into the bottom, but nope, Jeff just moves like a Zuckerberg.
GAME OVER 001	Papa Jeff, how many duplicates till I can get something like a skin that is not old?
Michael Lin	Wow is it another April fool?
Kitteh Kass	WTF SEEING IT IN SPECTATOR VIEW?! OMFG YES
katsupoi	mercy still dead
James DeRosa	Trash update. Almost all the dev time is obviously going to pro-play and pro-viewership features. Don't care about any of that. Fix competitive.  "I'm not going into all the details of the actual changes to the game, even though I just spent six minutes talking about a bunch of minutia about pro garbage that only applies to a portion of the player base."
Oliv7715	Her said that they are not anouncing a new map at BlizCon. But her said nothing about a new hero
Tyler Woods	These are reverts for Mercy.... she's still not going to be good. Revert the ult to Mass Rez and remove invulnerability, give her an E ability.
Sappy-Seaman	Talon tank, is it an omnic? Mech? Barrier?
Ice Vodka	it will be amazing for content creators, not normal use. its gonna be like a unique feature you never use
Realms	Blizzard, Make a map that is a theatre in which people log on, choose a hero and can watch the overwach league in game on a screen! Its friendly and awesome.
Darren	nerf torb
OddJaguar15	1:15 Hey uh. Valve has been doing this for a while.          Jeff I think you should meet Gaben, you seem to be a few years behind.
BadBoiRian	Mercy? BUFF? As in buff? Of Mercy? Is it April 1st?
dave shoe	Hey is there a reason why I‚Äôm i‚Äôve barely getting legendary in loot box‚Äôs especially around this special events
Shnoz Wanger	I bought the BlizzCon virtual ticket. Asked for a refund . Returned it . There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúExclusive ‚Äú skin this year. Bunch of BS is all I see and hear
Santo :1 : l	Just please more Lego sets please. I wish I wish
Mohd Imran	dead game
XxDeathSurferxX	yay mercy is geting back 60 heal om ;} know i wish you  bring back her old ult ;{
Daniel William	Girl that foundation was not blended into his forehead üëÄ
No Name	How about more content for the actual game instead of esports jesus
jesus d	Wow i really enjoy watching other players play :0, thats what i wanted all along
Antares Valdemar	Being able to use the viewer to do analysis of both your own play and the pros, from any angle at any speed and with replay? This will be so valuable in helping to improve, as well as having a lot of entertainment value in itself, looking forward to it.
Rare Blue Broccoli	Well Cod has had this for years but ok
Nah	Who cares about blizz con fix the game
SuperChief	So are we getting any ACTUAL CONTENT???
Rainy 69	6:24 he got super nervous after saying mercy cause he know all mercy mains will hunt him down if he gets another nerf
Justin Gregory	I only downloaded twitch on my phone to watch Overwatch League. Can I please get this awesome Overwatch viewer on my phone??!!??? I literally only made a twitch account for Overwatch League.......
Superkidra	So...  You can...  spectate....  the matches...   Alright?
Cool Dolpherino	Wadu hek
Corinne Hansen	RIP Huge Rez
Little Dandelion	Not 100% interested in the viewer but I'm really excited that it could be used for personal replays in the future. Because of this I will gladly take part in the beta testing. As someone who can't really record his matches with 3rd party programs due to having a garbage laptop this feature might actually make it possible for me to learn better. I know its more esports stuff and everyone is annoyed by that but look on the bright side. This opens the door for bigger and better things for casual to semi pro players.
TATALIA VONDERHART	The viewing sistem is going to be abused.  A friend of the person playing could tell them where enemies are.
Aiden Zoray	HLTV DID IT IN EARLY 2000........ ABOUT TIME
Spirit	Remove baguette
Sparky	Well, at least I still have smash bros to look forward to.
Ardy's OP	"in a way you've never seen before."  They had this system in CS:GO for the league matches.  I'm really happy it's here. But it's definitely something that we have seen before.
Jack Tee	how about a new game mode?
spectra playmaker	Developer buff tracer
minako134	I don't want a Mercy nerf, I want a REVERT.  Old Mercy was more fun, but Jeff was happy to agree with popular streamers that Mercys "just hid before ulting" even though more than 50% of DPS heroes hide before ulting and no one ever complains loud about that.  Old Mercy just needed an 'E' ability to give her more cooldowns to juggle, that would have fixed her. But no, let's force a strong ability like rez to be a normal CD instead of an ult like it should be.   Mercy used to require skill, now she's just a healbot and rezbot.  REVERT TO OLD MERCY.
Meead Rahman	How about you guys stop focusing so much on the OWL and put more consideration into the general player base. Yes, watching the games from different views is fine and all, but there are plenty of other things that need attention
Troopertroll	Yaaay!  New Dinoflask soon!
Prior of the Ori	I'v never watched or cared about the professional scene. However this update might actually get me into it because ill be able to watch people who play heroes I play more intimately and better learn from it.
Cake	Get off Overwatch and go back to wow jeff
H4CK3R_UNKN0WN	Jeff Can we get news on weapon skins.
S Tfu	He shaved!!
NikuMiku2003	Okay so let me get this straight. They're adding a feature which, currently, only works for pc players who are actually into the Overwatch World Cup, but they haven't stated whether or not they're working on the many issues with characters such as Doomfist and Bastion, or even anything to help fix comp and all of its issues. Okay  At least they're trying to buff Mercy that's something at least
Abradolf Lincler	Hey Jeff, can you save my SR since my teammates have no interest in doing that?
blizzaroxxx	I think he meant nerf mercy
FinestInstinct	Replay feature with multiple camera angles and such, eh? Halo Reach (cough, cough) whoo excuse me. üòµü§ßü§ß
quirky ork	Yes road and sym thank you very much
Andrew McEntaggart	let roadhog hook his own teammates
Farras Afif	Yo Dinoflask do your thing man
Samuel Han	*Congratulations Mercy Mains!*  You finally got buffed by Jeff!  We can now stop making memes now.
Kealii Faremiro	I hope one day, we will see a clan/guild/team system in ow, can't wait for that day !
Enoch Park	We're just waiting for Aria Rose to show up aren't we?
Simba Edits	Jeff acts like this is new groundbreaking technology
Gone Silent	ily jeff
Russell Blackthorn	Semmetra DOESN'T need a buff for Pete's sake
Aaron Smith	This news sucks, how about you fix your game
ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿπŸàŸäÿ≥	If The shotgun fix actually works out imma bust the fattest nut ever
Netsuko	How much money do I need to throw at Jeff for him to go over to the WoW dev team and slap some sense into them tho? D:
NitroAlley	Can't wait to pull out my battle mercy, *Reaper comes in* GABRIEL YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH BUFFS.
Lokipower	Buffs to Symmetra, now twice the cancer!
Stephanie Castagna	Jeff stopped before saying hes buffing mercy ITS A LIE
residentevil4life	praise Jesus for the Mercy and Sym buff but wtf does Reaper need when he's already insanley good as he is
Tj Slater	Jeff does understand Reinhardt didn't even get a voice line this Halloween and is in need of a major buff or at least bug fixes. But instead they buff reaper, Rienhardt's worst enemy.
Jordan Bacon	Overwatch is dying  add more characters!!!!!!!!
Why Zen?	Cuck.
SpiritofChaos	Has Jeff considered.... reworking Mercy's ult??? It was lame at 60 heals, and it'll still be lame
Zane Friday	YES JEFF THANK YOU THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR! Time to take my Battle videos to the next level!!!
Nixen Faerie	Almost all the feedback on the comments and a considerable amount on the forums show we don‚Äôt care about OWL. But hey at this point they only seem to care about this now, the actual game is an after thought now.
James Jackson	How are you Jeff? Drinking enough water?
Andrew Carlos	I dunno how many others feel the same about this but can we get a hero with a shield that the enemy can‚Äôt walk through? Every barrier hero‚Äôs shield is fine but...I just want a shield that you know? Is more shield like in that it blocks the enemy both in their offense and their advance
redyoshi777	This is overwatch from the jeff team
NooobzGamer	6:31 Mercy mains left the chat
Frostic Deicide	Roadhog and sym getting a buff? So glad i stopped taking this game seriously
8transformers	bring scatter arrow back.
Savon	WHY IS REAPER GETTING A BUFF
ASMR-SENSEI	So no meaningful events.. okay.. uninstall
Kitty Cat	To be honest Ana needs a buff
Sombat Silavong	i wish junker queen would be the next hero
Wali Hamid	Fixed ranked you flippin cuck
Felix Mendiola	He hates Xbox and psp4 I‚Äôm telling you !!!
Taylor Myers	Can we get a #nerfbrig
Bape Hoodie	What are the buffs for reaper
FurryEskimo	My problem with Roadhog has little to do with his hook or consistency..  I want him to feel Strong
‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞û‡∞æ Dippy Jippy ‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞û‡∞æ	Don't buff symmetra... she needs to be deleted from the game. She's awfully designed.
Jacob RB	he never said 'what is up guys, my name is Jeff from the overwatch team'
ElectricErger	Wow! Finally something for the armature casters!
1k subs with no vids._. productions	Whait a roadhog buff hopefully hes not just a ult charger I used to be a roadhog 1 trick pony but now im just a a genji/soldier main
Fuzz Robinson	Lmfao they just keep killing this game even further.
AARON CHAMBERS	J-...ju-    *JUST REVERT HER NO BUFFS TO NER VALCK,JUST. REVERT.HER.*
cryola	Jeff I enjoy our sit down talks together
Omgurafi Spoopenberg	2:11 Get ready for massive amounts of montages.
bigc33	Give Mercy her old Ult but with the current cast time
Plural	Wow the world cup viewer actually seems very very interesting
Janelle Saria	I know it's early for the winter wonderland event but,can you please give D.Va a reindeer skin please thanks üôèüèº
ScorchHellfire	7:08 Odd to say this, considering that the PTR changes over the years have almost universally gone live verbatim from their original form.
Bob Bob	Daddy Jaff
Lynn Perez	Buffs to Symm and Mercy? Time to drop the game completely until they (Mostly Mercy) get nerfed. Again.
Mute IV	I was thinking of a Roadhogs hook to be twirled to increase range and have a little start up time to really go anywhere :>
Smoose	Agreed, the Viewer is great new technology and all, and a really good way for players to get better at the game, but c'mon Jeff. Overwatch has been out for over 2 years now, and this game really need some spice again. It is not a dead game, the coummunity's still very much alive and will be for years, but you seriously need to get players intersted again. I still love playing Overwatch, always will do, but tbh, i think everyone here's tired of the same old thing. New improvements, events and other things are great, like every year, but this game really needs something fresh and new. Something that'll make it stand out again, like a new Winter Wonderland event, or anything like that, and players will drop their V-Bucks, and come back to Overwatch.
Panda	I have an idea for the game! Get rid of all the trashy heroes and trashy maps and actually work on decent ones. With the hero selection menu it's got to the point where I can't even see any of the characters faces.
Ali-X	This is just Nintendo direct but for Blizzard.
FRANCESCO MILLOCCA	Kaplan Jeff
Liam Komatsu	Buffing mercy just so they can nerf her again... great
otterodderdude	for the ptr I know many people do not do that is because of space on the computer, you have to download ptr and not enough computer space
FrozenTvDinner	Thanks for ruining Torb hes a support not dps!! Bring back Armor Packs!!!
Phiidyn	Overwatch movie, calling it now.
twomad 360	can we just make overwatch 2
ninethreefivesix	The Symmetra change is nice, but let her secondary fire go through shields again. She's a very weird dps but giving her an anti shield identity like Reaper would be great.
MemeMaster 1564	Yo on Xbox you can‚Äôt stay as team anymore, idk if it is a bug or it got removed but can they fix it if it‚Äôs a bug or tell me if it‚Äôs been removed plz and thanks
Muru	Jeff is my favorite, why does everyone hate him.       Remembers
SagnolTheGangster	Can you please release a proper mercy ffs... Or just bring back her 2016 abilities...
jceledono	Nerf Moira and Brigitte plz
Sergane Sariani	this is pretty amazing!! Thanks guys! I wish I had more time to devote to this amazing game! But the little I have is always great fun. Only request I could have would be a single player mode a bit more challenging than fighting bots or training ground. A bit like the events but on your own and permanently.
Diego Primero	So new hero or short?
Jason Flohe	Lol to valkyrie, the hero that can't heal, or dmg buff anymore because she is out healed by everyone. Are you going to return insta extra rez? Just make her a manditory trash can
Jonah Mudlaff	Focus on the game not the esports please.
Kingkieran03	Thank you so much for a mercy buff even if it's not a good one she really needs it
Mojito	Pls nerf Mercy. She is way to OP. Her heal makes game unfair and ultimate is too mobile so she shouldn't fly at all. Damage boost is also unfair and Mercy overall is unbalanced.
BuriedFlame	2:29 Drugs, Jeff. Lots and lots of drugs. Will there be an "Adderall Speed" mode to this drek?     Four and a half minutes to describe an unnecessary feature that will most likely add more bugs to the game. But hey, it's for Overwatch Esports‚Ä¶.which proves that is all Blizzard cares about.    Newsflash: Most people don't care about esports.
The Fractured but Whole [Jan_Boyega]	Please dont make an issue out of mercy where there is none... Please
ThatSameGuy9209	So like CoD theater mode but in Overwatch? Seems dope
Jon Keller	This is what I was waiting for, i'm insanely hyped for that! Props to Blizz
FastballZen	I‚Äôm so glad that Roadhog is getting a buff. After all he‚Äôs been through, he really needs it
Search The Galaxy	Will there be a opportunity¬†for players to get the Genji and Tracer skins from the¬†league on PC and Consel again?
Mike Calamari	So is mercy‚Äôs healing reverted back to 60 or only 60 when she ults
Hannes	This sounds great! Always hoped to be able to use the same replay features the editor/directors from the live streams are using.
Frankus Corrales	Need to fix roads yolo hook.
Very Vennie	My prediction is when you press q for Mercy's valkyrie it'll release a little damage radius around her so it feels a little more special popping that q at just the right time as mercy while also being able to heal your teammates and going attack mercy on the enemy after the initial popping
Spockitans	Nerf Mercy at least 6 more times is what he actually said
KidouKenshi22	And now PLEASE  nerf bridgitte, tobjorn, moira, reaper, junkrat, widow and pharah. And buff Hanzo
Joao Vitor Vieira	yeah the same event... again
Dinis Marques	He didn't say it's Jeff from the overwatch team I'm quitting
CE2BE	More heroes please.....2 - 3 new heroes / yr.....  isn't enough
oceanpiez uwu	OK but can you fix the game?
Tommy Plays	Theater mode Please!
Bill Boi	Why only pc
Logan Bradley	*B* *E* *F* *F*
Potato Sauc3	NERF: Mei, Moira, Brigita
SA TOMA	the VIEWER sounds amazing!!!
Ta Kneasi	Great now I'll be able to watch how much I suck from every single angle.
Steven Carrasco	So we get a World Cup camera but can't implement map selection or role queing ? mehhhhhh......
wafflecakepans	How about fixing the pharah - mercy pregame interactions you'd said you'd fix two years ago?
Taset90	nerf doomfist and hanzo u idiots
Guido	Wow,Symmetra,thank you jeff she really needed one
Mafu Senpai	02:42 okay Jeff *cough*
MarcusNMA	that esports sepc. mode sounds amazing. good job Jeff 'n co
Emeric Deyerres	I hope one day rein will be patch or will have a rework
Reza Rz	Thanks Love!
commandervulkan	4:55 Aaaw  5:45 Oh?
Bendu Brian	Dear Daddy Jeff, for Christmas I would like new game modes and for low grav and total mayhem to be server wiped. I like new skins over social features and replay camera angles. Thanks! PS, plz change wrecking ball‚Äôs name to Hammond;)
Teko o	we need owwc skins
Mokuteki	daddy jeff put yourself in ov i wanna play as a developer that trolls hanzo and widow players
Dionysis Polychroniadis	I expect a new hero... it's your fault for setting my expectations!
Sexysnake	he didnt say   "hey its jeff from the ow team" im disgusted
Kaji chuu	6:06 To skip the Esport BS. lol  With that said, overwatch has certainly become stale, like did anyone call for Sym buff? i felt like she was amazing already, sure you need a team with shields to help ramp up the beam to lvl3 but it was powerful enough!   All these changes feel like its geared towards casual players and thus ignoring the old fan base they already had. like rake in the new people but disapoint the players yall already had.
Austin Gattie	Really not something i believe anyone was wanting
Gwyrrd	Woot woot. Is this April 1st ?
Jason Woelfel	2:42 - Minus the sound, this is basically my view of how much overwatch devs care about its players.
DukeBaWue	Will there be a delay on the spectating mode? Otherwise, if you can watch, you could just feed info to a friend (when that feature ever gets released to the general public)...
not rly jeses	Please dont force your crappy esports on me.
Haley Sworen	Wow I love this but I'm a xbox playerüôÉ
Tostilocos	I‚Äôm waiting for that one guy to count how many times he blinks
Stealthy SOB	RIP thought he was going to say we won't charge you $50 for demon hunter Sombra :(
08ssnake	I wish they'd let console players test and have say in how the balance changes workout. It feels like they're letting PC players dictate the console players' gaming experience when the mechanics of playing on console are different from PC.
jay kemicols	Why is it so hard to just add a replay mode into the game? I didn't want to bring Fortnite into this, but they developed and input their replay mode within the span of days, but Jeff contradicts this... what's the difference?
sona sky art	I wounder wat buff there giving poor mercy XD
Powerful Gamer YT	4:30
christopherwalker	"Unfortunately only our pc viewers get to try" (pc boner intensifies)
Jake Dubiel	Bring back mercys old ult, it was literally the best part of her and you destroyed it
ShadowTBlack	A Mercy buff? You mean you will finally give us back the 5 man rez? :D
First Name Last Name	Give us OWWC skins. Please Papa Jeffrey.  OWWC viewer for master race only. Good Good. Keep the console peasants down so they don't rise up.
The Darkness	Mercy finally gets a break from the Nerf Hammer
canes2486	I think that everybody no matter what rank you are a competitive should have only one account to get rid of all the Smurfs because I can't play competitive anymore I tried a bite is just too much stress and you never know what your other teammate is doing either he's trying to help or just sabotaging the whole match just for his own doing
Terryfold	Dead game fortnite better
Nasro Didi	RIP
Pippin	I guess we're not getting the World Cup skins this year either ? However, I'm super excited about the future replay system.
Atheist	half of the update is just Jeff shoving esports down our throats  GG
superninja x	Is StarCraft a thing yet I miss that game
Grave Knight	I wish they would just change how Symmetra's damage buffing mechanic work so it's similar to Zarya's but instead of taking damage it trigger by dealing damage with primary fire.
KiraTheChallenger	buff mei more
the dreamer girl	I smell      Memes
Protecty	Ow is dying btw
J C	winter hockey confirmed.
Artemis Cephei	World Cup viewer sounds legit.  I'm happy for it. I actually didn't expect new maps!  So I'm glad to hear we'll still be getting new things.   Poor mercy needs a buff.
Johan Rocha	What about the trolls on comp?
J cool nice	replay mode is the replay mode for fortnite thats all it really is to adjust cams,speed, and players.
pjo843 H.	awsome
t39big trees	Hey dad
Mike Alley	5 minutes talking about owl and world cup 2 minutes of vaguely announcing character buffs. 53 seconds of thanking people for playing overwatch... you don't have to watch now  , you're welcome.
Ivan Jovanovic	Just Fix Ranked JEFF I lost my SR  Because other people levaling the GAME! FIX THE GAME!!!!!!!!!
Hitem Ariania	"YOU CHICKEN" wuwuwuwuuwu
GhostWarrior13	Nice!
Excuse your mouth	Balance changes lmao mercy is the most unbalanced hero in the game and you don‚Äôt think Doomfist needs a fix as well
Lawrence Auman	Spectator client and match replays WOW!! This is very exciting news, looking forward to it!
Rizen Dagudo	they say buff for mercy but its a nerf I just know :(
Mark Sargent-Bennett	ah hail jeff!
Œõwaadh	Im just glad my boy Reaper is getting some love
ATRStormUnit	This is a good idea to make FPS-Esports actually watchable.
Dennis Chavez	Buff hammond plz
GeneralTrueFocus	PC Master Race = Glorified Quality Assurance testers.
Dark Phoenix	All these changes need to make it to live....Game feels great on ptr
Hagen	So you just managed to do what Dota and CSGO have had for almost a decade?
iR3aPer x FaucheuR	Reaper !!!
CookiePanda 50241	All you care about are the pc players what about the Xbox players and PS4 players it‚Äôs like we don‚Äôt exist
Schwendyj lol	I hate to be THAT guy, but isn't this kinda like Fortnite's replay mode? (just wondering)
ben fuller	So blizcon is diablo on switch and nothing else Jeff? Why are you guys even having blizcon this year
Hanzo Main	I waited him to say *HEY EVERYONE THIS IS JEPF FROM THE OVERWATCH TEAM*
dinmorful	getting sick and tired of getting bans because i dc for 30 seconds. Imagine putting people in jail for crimes they did not commit. they are fine with banning people and not overturning for dc even though they are able to see that i log back on within the min. but nono lets not bann trolls.
et3rnal12	How about you fix Competitive Mode instead of funneling resources into niche gimmicks that only a portion of the player base will use?
Sica *	BUFF ZEN
Lmao Gaming	I genuinely do not understand how can you balance heroes before fixing all the bugs. When, if, the time will come and all bugs will be fixed are you going to rebalance heroes again?     Not playing the game anymore, it got worse, it's unplayable.
Dyanna Rivera	Mercy is so broken
Moooh	üëé
Two Peace	Called Patch 1.3.0...interesting, i think its a hint of the next hero, named Liao or Lio. Thoughts xD? Maybe im crazy.
L3ON	PotG 2.0?
dreminh	this game is running out of gas
TheEfficentPiggie	YESSSSS
danubus rann	Jeff, add a way for us to post POTG etc directly to Twitter or Facebook without using another program
Ariel	Buff genji and tracer or nerf stuns
Yossha Wesh	He didn't say "I'm Jeff from the Overwatch Team" :(
Oniji	Can we get this truly amazing level of community communication for Diablo, as well?
Oliver Phillips	*GIVE LUCIO NEW SKINS!!!*
Remedy4theheart	Anyone else feel betrayed?! They actually reverted Mercy nerfs that made her so overbearingly oppressive. They push more OWL which no one cares about. No new map no new hero (as far as we're concerned). No new short, because lets be honest Dva's own was not too long ago and thats not enough time, (for Blizzard....at least) to make another high quality cinematic.  This is a slap in the face man. A lot of bad very little good.
Somelaok	I hear reaper buff, i like
Cheese4G	Hey Jeff, can you say the words "platypus", "pineapple", and "forty-year-old scotch" in your next update? Asking for a friend who isn't dinoflask.
XiasIV	Gotta fix the custom game presets that died from Sym 3.0. Lots of people are still waiting to get back to work on their projects that took them over a year to make
Frank Openty	Overwatch World Cup Viewer should've been number 80 on the things to do list.
Bartosz Jaskulski	Maximilien is next hero. 100% legit
Nordling Valhalla	We want tv series about overwatch We want story line
XxRainbowSkullxX	:O
Draconid	Hi DotaTV
SunzOffski	The reaper buff, he needs a rework, scaled damage based upon current hp of enemy, meant to be a tank buster but he will punish all with 50% less spread.
Topias Isotalo	They're gonna buff Roadhog, Mercy, Reaper and Symm by removing Doomfist from the game.
jay by key	I Just Love OVERWATCH
ali alqtari	Jeff:this will be for PC only   Me:why papa why......
ylside2121	idc abt any of the hero changes, REPLAY AND VIEWER SYSTEM POGCHAMP
Facepalm	I think that its right that you can do more heal with Ana than with Mercy just because Ana needs way more Skill and Mercy has the rez. Buffing her is the wrong direction.
Philip Chou	OMG, this is exactly what I have wanted.  Thank you Blizzard.
-GZU -MCSR	Yassss *REAPER* Buffs ‚ù§üòç
tyler robertson	Glad I didn't buy the broadcast rights :)
Kemya Ali	overwho ? i don't know her
Atlas Sky	Can you imagine a replay system ? Pretending fortnite doesn‚Äôt exist OMEGALUL
Detzerk Cetz	Finally :D
Shay	I am tired of them concentrating on the e-sports and not the game itself where normal everyday people play. We are the majority they are not. Stop pushing esports on everyone.
MDMRQ8	buff for mercy !!!
ycarmi	When the aero 29?
Winfried Bauer	Keep up the great work... Loving the Overwatch experience

Latroy Judd	Still no love for Winston üò™
BlackWatch Squshyturtle 115	*Jeff... You have a vary boring way of announcing things... You put no emotion, or fun in how you say things..*
Dark Misstrust	Since you're doing this for the Overwatch league World Cup is there anyway we can get the tokens for the Overwatch league without using twitch to get them? That would be nice dyer all.
WildHogTV	Nice, a feature that Bungie had mastered already back in 2007 with Halo 3, is only now being beta tested by Blizzard, in 2018. Good job..! [slow clap]
Fulnaz	Buff Sym until she can throw 12 turrets and have her able to bash with her Shield Wall  Make it happen Jeff
Simon West	If only this amount of of attention would go into other areas that urgently need attention, but I guess looking at how much money micro transactions make blinds them to the issues the game has.
Kay	come on. this game is now purely updating for the league... get some feature/new game mode (aka new Halloween event) for people who aren't in the league.
Kaofrost	PogChamp my editors friends replay is finally here !!
MysticSybil	Whoah is it just me or does jeff actually look like hes AWAKE in this one!? Are they finally letting you sleep??
McDzenny	We need more heroes, ffs. Stop this nonsense reworks.
aHairyWhiteGuy	Wasn't mercy at 60 healing per second before the nerf? So they basically made her better than she was? Okay.....why not make her healing 55 healing per second instead?
Brandon Medrano	Ha. Console succ.
InF Void	Half of these comments are just people still salty about mercy finally being in a more balanced place üòÇ
Simone Mazzuoccolo	YES YES A BUFF FOR MERCY!
Kevin Rosario Rivera	I kinda wanna see a rein change for instant shield deployment like brig it would be great hopefully eventually that happens great dev update keep working hard guys
iDrinkYourTears	Bring back old mercy. Heroes never die. Pfffft. Did you see how many nerfs you gave her? She's pretty much dead.
GOT TOSA	ded
hypersapien	You ruined Symmetra.
Datal-J	"Roadhog and Mercy are Disqust"
TheFandomkid	Wait......did I hear that right?......they are gonna buff mercy?.....üò¢.....is this a real...
S-51	video starts at 6:10
Am Gill	Its not a buff you gave mercy, it's a half-assed revert. Think about it, before 50hps she gave 60hps both in and out of Valk and valked sucked (still does). This won't change ANYTHING. Rework mercy and take away her rez on E.
ICManiac	Oh I thought this game was already cancelled.
david german schutz	You need to expand overwatch at the blizzcon because people is getting tired
Starsi Q	Can you delete doomfist plz and I will start playing again k thnx bye

Argus Flotilla	Mercy dualwields rainguns during valk confirmed
Toast_des _Tages	Thank you Jeff.All other people please push the Payload
Ayanna Scott	like reaper needs a buff last night one reaper managed to destroy my mech as dva alone which is pretty stupid         but i killed him as baby dva ‚Äòcause crouch became an option :3
pepperplume	This sounded like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get your hopes up too high for blizcon‚Äù

Saulo Brasileiro	FIX THE MATCHMAKING ! IM NOT THE SAME RANK AS A FLANKING REIGNHEART OR A DPS ONLY MOIRA OR ... I AM NOT THE SAME RANK AS SOMEONE THAT DOESNT KNOW BRIDGET HEALS WITH HER SWINGS !
Billie Lourd	Sis thought Moira was getting something special based on the thumbnail. I played myself for getting my hopes up.
Davey647Returns	‚ÄúMercy will be getting a buff‚Äù  PRAISE BE TO JEFF! His thirst for mercy nerfs has finally been quenched.
Alexandra Darkbee	R E A P E R   B U F F S ? ? ?       As a Reaper main I am happy to hear that.     M E R C Y    B U F F S ? ? ? FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER??? üòÇ

Gabriel Stolarczyk	So, still no (solo) role queue, great... -_- And I don't care if DPS-only players will have to wait much longer - learn something else! :-P
Crimson Knight	fix mercy please, her current state is absolute trash, you guys made me stop playing your game.
LauW G.	Please just make a dozen of maps already. I'm not saying "Compare to TF2" cause that would be unfair, but still, stop making Arcade maps and make Real mode maps.
Tatu Heikkinen	Of course is only for PC. No love for console
Yizzaz	Please please give tracer another skin you can buy with credits pleeaase
Luke Emin	Hey what about PTR for console
WarmMilk	That's amazing
gadick	"Mercy buff" what type of nerf is this?
DJ Anubis	Buff for Reaper and Roadhog? Thus is interesting...
Mel Weg	I mean, can we just nerf the rip tire a little bit? Reduce the blast radius or decrease the timer or increase the cost or something? There's very little out there to negate that tire's damage or manuverability.
punk rat	thats good!!!!
Shawarma Frames	MERCY DOESNT NEED A BUFF, all you trash mercy mains who dropped to bronze because of mercy nerf are complaining about mercy. SHE IS BALANCED, LEARN A NEW HERO FOR GOD SAKE
Krister Nielsen	There is a big difference in liking the game and enjoying to watch others play it. Personally i would never watch these world cups so in my eyes you are wasting resources on functions which you could spend developing new game modes or entire games set in the OW universe
SpiritNoYoso	He knows chat monkaS
Greg T	does any average play really care anything about this world cup thing?   Unless you live in your parents basement and pissing in a bottle so you don't have to leave your room, you really just new content that we can play, not watch others play.
Ausbeth Ajagu	Idk.. I think the hype alone from casting is alot more fun than just spectating (which is why I find watching scrims so boring).. thoughts?
KASISQURDA	all the world cups and leagues.... when the game is broken...
Reainny	Where's my hero 29
Carl Marinas	The viewer would be a help on catching hackers, specifically wall hacks and aimbots huge feature
Malacite	The changes are already up on the PTR and I like them, but I still think the best thing they could do for Mercy is remove Res altogether and have her focus on switching stances similar to Lucio. But where she'd differ is swapping her staff's function would no longer be instant but take a few seconds,  and in exchange for that buff the power of both modes. IMO it would give her a good level of micromanagement and really emphasize the need for the player to read the situation correctly, as those few seconds where you're stuck swapping the beam on your staff could cost a fight.
Yunnklevoot Yunnkleshnout	Go commit lifen‚Äôt
McToilet	just let mercy be able to blast up people again
Ralf Gl√∂ckner	World Cup Viewer - that will be so COOOOOOOOOOL!!!
matteoc98	Dislike because he didn't say "This is Jeff from the ow team" hahaha üòÇ
Berk Turgut	Will world cup viewer be accessible in non beta regions during the world cup or will we have to have beta to be able to use it in the time
ChargedNut99	Junkertown.
Mr. Weebfanboy101	Halo 5 has this feature already
HimSnow	We need cardboard sword genji next year!
Aci	Blizzard logic: _Taking 100$ from someone and giving them 20$ back should make them happy_
Glassed Silver	The real news is that they deem balance changes necessary for so many heroes at once and Baguette isn't among them. :thinking:
OEXI	Who else loves to hate this man sometimes lol
Cornflake Comando	Next year can you actually do something different for the Halloween event? 3 years and essentially no changes. Cheers

Mario Petkov	Mercy Buff: Mercy mains' dream come true
dani machause	Buff for Mercy? NO, its just half-reverting the nerf she had months ago. Ok, so now we have the same useless Ult as before... We cannot play her in ranked because there is allways an Ana or Moira in the team as the main healer and people allways ask for Lucio or Zen because of their great ults, but because Mercys ult is garbage and do NOTHING (even with the """"buf""") if a team plays her, they are doing less than with other healer and its very sad. If only her Ult was like much more HPS to single target, that would be a wise step to make Mercy more impactful and strong (Maybe they should focus her as the best Single Target healer and emphasize that with her ult). At the end, Mercy needs a rework , im a Main Mercy since the beta and she is in a very bad spot right now, hope they realize about it and do something (at least, more than half-revert a nerf -.-).
Corey Franklin	Talon tank powered by the cube that Talon stole from the train in the McCree comic. The Route:66 payload has been updated to an opened container with cool air effects but it used to be closed. The container has a striking similar reference to D.va‚Äôs Meka design exclusive to her and no other Meka pilots. McCree is on the front poster for the Blizzcon advertisement. I think that we will receive a hero or animated short relating to this topic at Blizzcon.

GodSecretWeaponOW	Ofc Sym needs a buff ._. If u are going to buff her primary fire nerf her turrets. Its so dumb getting insta killed by something that's not a player seriously. And don't come with just destroy the turrets 4head.

Ya Boi	I quit this game after season 5
Red Joker	Ok so honestly speaking I know you guys have a huge and amazing development team but where are they? Hero releases are sparse, map releases are sparse and the events recently have honestly been boring. Please give us something big to shift the game.
LilyBizkit	The world cup viewing: Does this have to be done in game or battlenet launcher? I'm a console player but play hearthstone so i have the launcher.

Tristan Oliver	I've legit tried to go with mercy mains but idk I cant lol they're legit not happy with any changes, face it guys mass rez was op af, at least they should reduce the number of rezs possible but still op af, she needs a new ult. So get it in your head that mass rez will NOT be brought back and stop complaining 24/7 Now you can start trash talking me go ahead
Sqoz	"a special version of Overwatch". I sure hope they will not milk this for money. It's just replays. Been in games for ages.

Shogun Tanuki	about time some love for my boy Road
RayZ gameZ	Hey PAPA JEFF
E.O.W.	mercy mains crying in 3... 2...
Wizardxeze	My opinion is that they Half hearteldy reverted Mercy's nerf ~ it is not buff it is just going half way to revert the 60 healing -> 50 healing lowering which was so big a nerf that she is almost useless, except Phara poket   I won't be playing Mercy untill either Phara is on my team or they Revert the literall unnessessery nerf, as they 2 years back buffed it to be 60 FOR REASON!
IpoteticAMVsChannel	OMG it's true!! They only care about OWL this days...that's sad..
Daniel Wei√ü	I would like to see that blizzard make a kind of reset between de Seasons so the player who had a really bad season can get better SR. I¬¥m stuck on 2000SR on my Main account but i created a new one and startet with 2800SR thats weird and i want to play with my main account but not in that tier..
Rob S	I think they‚Äôre delusional. Why focus on esports when ur core game player base is dying?!?!  Stop focusing on things which the average player does not care about.
Section X	Have you forgotten what your ACTUAL fans want? Is Esports the only thing that matters now? We want to play the game, not watch it!
Bak Akira	I hope we would have the option to disable this useless thing
Main Reaper‚Ñ¢	Mercy buff? Funny joke Jeff.
Joseph Barbango	Mccree cinematic
shadygodd	jeff, what hair routine are you using or what transplant?
TheHunterWolf	This replay feature be available in the game itself, hope it happens soon.
paul	Ok the World Cup thing sounds sick
buffydaslaya	That mercy buff does nothing, revert her to 60/hps.

LifeHunt Scythe	Zenyatta lore when
joshua perez	Buff genjiii or rework him :(
bidiBuzz	it's gonna be so cool to review the scrims !!!!
MindGem	7:51 Focus lips.
YonaBird	Stop promoting and doing the World Cup. You are promoting 200 Players that are top rated instead of LOADS of other players
Dug The Pug	I would rather have a mercy revert but a buff is still nice
lolmaster 52	I wish blizzcon would come to the uk or     Northern Ireland
woRNab	Ok it's just like csgo :)
CWFitness	Genji buff
mechaFoxs	blizzard is going to take over with this new feature
Zyrex	dead game tbh

Xoid ‚Ä¢	Finally!! I can learn from the pros ! Spectating individual players will help a lot !
Manga Mango	Yes reaper
„Å≠„ÅìCat	Hi Jeff I missed u bb
SmallBoi	Stylosa is s h o o k e t h
nickdanger12345	Great, I'm glad they're focusing on esports instead of adding new features,I don't know, something as insane as a NEW event gamemode in 2 years. Consider this, a full price game with loot boxes, that is also making a fortune off esports should have more than just extra cosmetics. Cosmetics that they actively make you GAMBLE for. It's just scummy, especially after  they "fixed" the drop rate well after the game had left its prime. They created a problem and then actively withheld the solution until they maximized profit, and then people turn around and act like they're saints for doing it? Don't even get me started on how they gate content behind arbitrary periods of time in order to spur your sense of urgency to, again, maximize profits. Yet to this day they can't be bothered to make new game modes for events or fix some of the blatant issues with ranked? People need to stop for a second and remember what comes before Blizzard, Activision.
Matty Mills	YAS A MERCY BUFF FINALLY!!!
Vasko Bundevski	replay feature incoming it better come soon for us !!!!
Mythik Beast	Make the demon hunter sombra skin available to get in game. Please,
Vark	Winston‚Äôs winrate will be 35%
verbalkint33	Incredibly excited for the World Cup Viewer. Thank you.
Jamborino	Plz Jeff
Niko Siilin	How about are you and your team working with hero 29 for blizcon
papa bruce	Worrying more about the E-Sports than the actual game OMEGALUL
S3MJJ3	Oh and now you're gonna BUFF Mercy, well Mercy get out of the trash can now.
Politikz Official	Ok so  You guys co designed destiny so can we please get a colab? I'd love to play a character that has different ult options like old symmetra and could choose between the 3 different types of ult in destiny 2. Like void grenades or the sword thing dawnbreaker? Or the electric field. The sword ult could be like hanzo's dragon but faster 1 hit of damage instead of continuous. The void grenade could be like bastion's ult but unable to move while doing so like pharah's ult in the sky but you'd get like a small amount of shield to stay alive longer. The electric field could provide continuous damage to a certain area, like Hammond's ult but not instant damage or death to squishy heroes. I just thought it'd be a cool idea. Could be like solider 76 when regular shooting.
rana alshehri	ONLY PCüò≠üò≠
noori comhair	WHY PC AGAIN!!!  JEZUS CONSOLE STILL EXISTS YOU KNOW!!!!
sahil sapare	Stop spending so much time on OWL
Woof woof	Flex mains?
Necro	6:24 What!?!? Mercy is getting a buff!?!?

Sarmaua MagicƒÉ	"Hello, this is Jeff from the Overwatch team..." wait he didn't say it wot
NoMercy _Ow	BUFF MERCY       Really she needs more buffs her rez is pretty weak now. Blizzard do something
Blazenado Stop Motions	Thank you father Jeff
42pantelis	Thank you for all the updates and your efforts Jeff, but would it not be better to actually fix the many imbalances and toxicity in the game instead of adding slo-mo on a viewer that your corporate bosses are pushing for? I bought a game, not a TV channel.
Neboj≈°a Muljava	I love how Jeff is personal with the players of his game <3
Jonathan Woodhouse	Can you make a gamemode where it's old overwatch and there Are no new heroes and all the old one works like they did back in the good old overwatch days? That would be fin, because I miss the old mercy
Moose	I'm excited about the upcoming Reaper buff. He's one of my main DPS. I'm hoping for a fixed Shadow Step because it often glitches by not detecting platforms correctly.
Iris Heart/Plutia	Reaper buff? They're trying to bring me back?
kookabura	I don't understand who this man is Where is the overwatch T-shirt???
m7manunited -	Hello keff japlan
BigPapi	I hoped for a moira update
Sinkito	Great dev update! I'm so happy for us Mercy Mains as well ^~^ Thanks daddy Kaplan! <3
DreamInSilence	The spectating tools are going to be a great addition I'm sure. Now Blizzard, the next feature I think this game really needs is some kind of clan system. I feel like that would be a great thing for competitive mode.
Ahmed Alyuosf	Wait Mercy Buf?
AwkwardAnonymous	Okay this view mode thing is really exciting! My one complaint when watching OWL was the camera flicking around and disorienting me. Getting to control where your looking sounds really exciting!!
Lithviewr	who is this satan ?
Mike Blondeau	Oh yes, buff my boi Reaper
Duncan Moran	hey super quick do you mind not giving us minuscule mercy buffs that actually do nothing to help her character?
Tim Kennedy	Can you tell me why the Battlenet client has suddenly crashed after the last update and will not re-download again?
Regular Clasher	a Mercy buff?? i never thought i‚Äôd ever hear that
Trzecie Konto Orkaborga	MORE LORE LESS E SPORT

Ryan de Vaan	Mercy buffs
Butter cup	BOOST MERCY!!!!!!
LunarCatan	"world cu--" skip "world cu--" skip "world cu--" skip "world cu--" skip "world cu--" skip
Blumare	BUFF MERCY MORE!!!!!
Kevin Da Silva	Can the Overwatch team just admit that the Mercy rework was a complete failure and actually fix her, this "buff" is basically nothing, this does not fix the core issues of the dumb unnecessary rework and plethora of nerfs to said failed rework.
Djana Brokholm	Poggers
Grimskull 94	So theres a chance a hero is going to be revealed next month
Œ© Œ©	Just remove Brig
_IZZY _	He definitely just hinted at a new hero at blizz con, he was very specific in saying "no new MAP"
Sensei_OW	This world cup spectator thing is gonna be lit af
megahewy finnish gaming	Its good to hear your voice, jeff.
Brodie Man88	I truthfully hate E-Sports. It‚Äôs ruining games for me.
Yamon 113	Where my mercy mains here???
Cyberspirit	I'm not hugely into E-Sports but, this is a really nice feature.
M Torres	Jeff is my Dad
SashoMedia	Awesome direction towards viewers experience! Keep the good work!
Zane	dinoflask save overwatch
eggyroll	6 characters in 2 & half years xD
Abdulrhman alshmrani	I got band today pls mr. Jeff gave me my account i am so sad . I love Overwatch too much .
ScottOne	That was a useless Developer update - world championship viewer app, first 6 minutes.  Skip ahead guys.
Kevin Nederberg	Guys i bought legendary edition a while ago and now that it has added more skins how do i get them?? I realy wannt the skins.
Kentz Hodiono	I hope some kind of permanent story mode is in the game. We need more story!
Nikolaj Laursen	ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q ROLE Q PLZZZZZZ
Hakei Liu	Yay mercy and symetra get buffed two characters I actually use thanks so much jeff!!!!!
Fabrizio Rapelli	Cool, so the game will be easier to watch. What if I told you that we would like it to be worth playing and not watching?
Jocke715	This is insane world cup veiwer
Caleb Boulio	wow people still play after all the nerfs and reworks ?
BlueSoulDragon Destructor	If you could put a story mode that would boost your sales and gamers this is for you and us
Mynameis Gr√©ta	Mercy mains: OMG YESSSSS JEFF BUFFING MERCY THERES STILL GOD!
Sam Freeman	Dude the spectator for Owwc sounds pog
william greif	Lol
Fritz Asuro	Just stop reworking heroes! You guys are ruining the uniqueness of the heroes. Always catering the pro players.
TheMineCrafter2018 Too_Cool_For_LastNames	PLEASE MAKE A PARIS MAP

hacnap	Wait... Jeff was from the Overwatch team?
JasonBeKillin	make sym turrets do no dmg, only slow down people PLEASE
Jonathon Alsing	Is map content a metaphor for Diablo 4?
Obsidian Dragon	‚ö†Ô∏è Brace yourselves, Mercy mains. A new nerf incoming!  ‚ö†Ô∏è
Just a normal Crusader	It's overwatch from the Jeff team
EntenDNA	Yes finally!
EinhornBoy 3000	Pls make a recomended mode for the Viewer, so you can watch the game like on twitch.
Szymon Duda	Ovl is Just boring
Diego Mahoney	WHERE ARE MY TRACER BUFFS.
DerSisch	OK... first of all: Sym not rly needs a Buff, she done the most work with Teleporter, Turrets and her secondary fire. The rest is ok, but I think the Mercy buff will a bit to strong, actually, the healing comming back to 60 is fine, but Valk is actually pretty impactful when used right, so she is actually better than before she got the last nerf (the one that destroy her actually, but ok) Next: Can we make a few changes of Tanks interacting to CC? And yep: i mostly asking for Reinhardt, because he is at the moment the most time absolutly necessary, but absolutly unfun to play against comps with more than 1 stun or CC-abbility.
Andrew2003Gr Chatziathanasiou	We have questions like : WHY SHOULD REAPER GET A GODDAMN BUFF!!!!???? You should nerf Briggite's lifesteal and overpowered abilities
Tjersero	POGCHAMP!
Miraak	Main Tank would be a good idea, the game could use more than 3 main tanks
Mitchell Li	Love what they are doing for the esports but the rank game still needs fixing
W for Wawa	I‚Äôm scared for the symmetra buff
Failed Pixel	I've never said this before. I love you Jeff.
The Looinrims	Jeff shaved
Fenrir AB	Mercy 1.0
Clovally	So... whens the FPS issue going to be fixed?
Winterpassing	finally i can watch the replays    thats what ive been waitin for
Andreas Seifer	Reaper buffs? Isnt it hard enough for Main Tanks already? ;_;
Very Unique Name	JUST BRING ROADHOG BACK!
Mimerafm	:O
Ace	MERCY BUFFFF
RAS Clips	WHY TF ARE YOU BUFFING SYMMETRA AND REAPER?!?!??!
Rick Sanchez	I hope one day they release 2 heroes at the same time. Kind of like a good/evil type thing. Ying and yang hero. Something like the ying yang twins.
Andrei	how about focusing on the events so we don't have to play the same halloween map 3 years in a row?
subterranean~	replay system PogChamp
Long N	Now I can go back to my demos and show exactly why my teammates suck.
respectingwomen	Still no Brig or Hanzo nerf... I'm schleep
Gloria Roies	OWWC viewer! Replay systems! That‚Äôs what I want! I‚Äôm crying.
Jake Schmidt	Is junkerqueen going to be the next dps hero announced at blizzcon, let‚Äôs hopeüôè
Simon Zane	another esport bullshit that nobody care about.
Paultato	7:37 Nailed it!
Big Bad Buzz	WE CSGO NOW BOIS
Dark Lady	Do my eyes deceive me ?  A m....mmmercy buff?
Someone Someone	Buff for mercy? Is that a dream?
YourGenericName	I want Overwatch 2
Scully bb	Jeff's forehead foundation isn't matching again, someone teach this man to blend his foundation smh
Hibbs Dibble	Bungie was doing this a decade ago not only in multiplayer but also in the campaign as well.....just saying.......
TryHardNoob	As a Mercy main, love to hear some buff about Mercy
Disclaim	Why do I get throwers in majority of my games jeff
Mei	We can now learn from the pros in first person, with real, competitive matches. Nice.  Also make my piggy boy indestructible please thanks.
Evanka Trump	Can we nerf Jeff Kaplan? He is too op
Marky	No map from a Small Indie Co. TM
flyingpigmonkey1	Brigitte still in the game so I still don't care.
ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ/ hussain 29	Overwatch is dead
jarry plundermen	Isnt that like GOTV in csgo?
OG Aley	We all made fun of Jeffs famous introduction but we got so used to it that when it doesnt happen it feels hella odd.
Junyi Chen	Just move her to the trash no one likes her üòÇ
Emanuel Zanoaga	Im a Moira main
Cat Muffin	FINLEY BUFF FOR MERCY :D
Josh Espinoza	Disappointed no Winston buff maybe a shorter shield cooldown or longer duration for his Giant taser
Daniel Canales	Jeff talking sounds like a Rick and Morty improv bit
Michael Roberts	I think that ability should be enabled for all games, yours and mine alike. I don't much care about OWL. Especially after buying tokens to get the Lucio emote to no avail. Quite disappointing considering I paid $20 for owl tokens to just sit there. Kind of completely ruined my experience.
Jimin Is sexy	Where's mei's buff?
Slade	Why is there another Reaper buff? Ugh.
PjdTheSpeedster	the lord jeff at it again. also why was this feature not in the game at the start?
DoomDriver32	Do like a tropical paradise map, like caribbean style island or something!!
Zant	Why is Overwatch Esports the priority right now... don't get me wrong, I love it and I've personally gone to see games irl. But the game is in sore need of an overhaul and a world cup viewer just isn't gonna cut it. The BR genre is siphoning players off by the hundreds if not thousands daily... you need to get people interested in this game again.
C.J. Rogan	STEP ONE TO VOD REVIEWS BOIS!!!!!!!!
◊ô◊î◊ï◊†◊™◊ü ◊ê◊î◊®◊ï◊ü	Overwatch is dead  Littel chance that blizzcon make overwatch popolar again
BJSRecordingStudio	Reaper buff??? GTFO!!!!!
Andhaka Efiel	That viewer sounds promising.
Oh yeah mr.krabs	Keff Japlen
iDayez	Overwatch is dead
ItsCharlieTV	You know what would be cool, VR first person from any player.
Bigfatlip	Pee Wee Herman all grown up working for blizzard :O what is this world we live in.
TableWrens	Symmetra and Mercy make sense. Roadhog already heals himself, can block Winston's alt and can insta kill anyone over a drop point. Reaper is team killing machine who can literally stand on a Dva Bomb and not be hurt. So I dont know why you would buff them.
Tyler J	Roadhog doesn't need any buffs
Mimickz	i'm actually annoyed that they have been working on this worldcup viewer :/ i wish they just stick with in game content
sevenlift	Please update story line not origin or side story
TheDrover15	2:42.... oh no
ŒßŒ°ŒóŒ£Œ§ŒüŒ£ ŒöŒëŒöŒëŒíŒüŒìŒôŒëŒùŒùŒóŒ£	I ned a spartan in OVERWATCH
GAMER / OTAKU	Finally a buff for MERCY I'm coming back to OVERWATCH
John Siniolakis	Amazing game you guys never cease to impress me ,you always try to improve the game even after 3 years. Really excited about the Spectator mode as well!!! üòÅ
Jason Lee	NERF THE BLACK BALD DUDE
Tat Jana	Why would they buff reaper again?
JayOsonic	Can you announce Overwatch for the switch please
FavouriteMeat	I thought the feature was like a role Q or something like it .......whelp not playing this game till this happen
Brand BoomBloom	Your game is going down hill
theonlyone2b1	The best news would be Overwatch is...."DELETING BRIG FROM THE GAME!!" WOOOOO!! For real though, THANK GOODNESS FOR THE HOG BUFFS! MUCH NEEDED!!
MikmakBOIII	baff symetra nerf the torrets
Jack Bernard	Hey OW team, will the OWWC tools announced be available to other organizations to broadcast their own version(s) of the OWWC to their audience? Just a production director curious!
Jake Paul	I‚Äôm overwatch from the Jeff team
Keegan raath	Pls pls pls pls put servers in South Africa
Windwalker	Did Jeff get a hair transplant? Why does he have a red triangle under his hairline?
cutiepatootie wolf	I appreciate the symmetra buff
TheSnufking	Sorry, but I don't care about the camera features at all, not to mention esport.
Leisurous	So like the cod theater mode
Dimentive	If only they were to add a replay system for regular matches as well.
Chris Tomsky	Had to delete my previous comment because, ATTENTION MERCY MAINS: THIS IS NOT A BUFF!! At best its like half a revert of her last healing nerf. This is in NO WAY fixing Mercy. Thank you for trying Jeff, but please, TRY AGAIN.
Luke Henton	Who else requirers a mcree short
Sir Fapituitus	Okay wow World Cup. Okay wow blizcon, cool. So is it safe to stay that half of their workforce is focused on the World Cup. There aren‚Äôt a lot of people who care about the World Cup Jeff
Adri√°n Solis	Resume: - buff for mercy's ultimate, roadhog, reaper and symmetra (no details) - we won't have new map for this blizzcon
CampaignerSC	Honestly I just want new events so it doesn't feel like I'm playing the same game I've been playing for 2.5 years. Everyone I know is bored and moving on because the only new content is skins and sometimes a map to do the same old game modes on.
Lucas de Abreu	hitting the brakes on the hype train, smart move
Ra-Ra Rainstorm	I actually choked when he said Mercy gets a buff
Rhett Corbin	Oh you have 300+ hrs on *hero* , it'd be a shame if someone were to....... RRREEWORRRKKK THEM!!!       - Love, Jeff
Cute little cake	Your game sucks
Cirax Musix Promos	Lol Halo 3 had this in 2007...
Rosie -_-	Mercy? I only know Nerfcy
thePANDEMlC	I might actually watch this now, since I can actually stick on one person's position. I can't tell you how much I loathe these big team fighter games when they go to a 4th person perspective overlooking the fights, takes me out of it. Actually following the team I want and the player I want is to me how the game should be seen. Replays of team fights should be in 4th person. This is a blessing.
Evan Fanara	Tank main here, you did what!?!?
CL	Wish they would put more effort into the game, rather than use resources on Overwatch League and "Viewers" for the Overwatch Cup. Player base has fallen right off the cliff on consoles.
Dapps	where's the fallout videos?
thesavgplatypus	im on console...      why
Alpacarie	Jeff : *"Hello this is Jeff from the overwatch team."*         Mercy mains : *shaking and quaking*
Alchemix	We already had that feature in paragon, but epic games decided to eliminate that unfortunately
S P	I missed the Dev Update. I think we had none for 3 months at one point. Glad they‚Äôre back and I‚Äôm looking forward to the future of Overwatch! :)
_Shook_	Guys. This is NOT a mercy buff. It's a partial revert. Blizzard realized that their decision to weaken a main healers healing is dumb.
Alex Archer	Nerf doomfist
Vandri	PR: Viewers are complaining about Camera Angles in Esport matches Cameraman: I'd like to see them do better Jeff: Now introducing Overwatch World Cup Viewer Fired Cameraman: ...
JequalsJ!	That viewer actually has me so hyped let‚Äôs GOOOOO
Mouthy	YOOOO POGGERS
Adeon Writer	WHO IS THIS HANDSOME MAN. He did not introduce himself!
rafa garcia	when is PTR coming to console papa Jeff?
Roz Stripe	Jeff come back to world of warcraft we need you!
Benassiesto	BRING DIFFERENT LANGUAGES TO CONSOLE
Kuro Maru	Reeeeeaper!! Finally
Carlos Fuentes	Valkyrie stills useless.
TheLazyPusheen :3	Finally!! A mercy buff! This better stay. Mercy isn‚Äôt staying as mercy anymore.
Daniel Zimmerman	Roadhog: I‚Äôm jealous of Overwatch‚Äôs hook to get everyone addicted
William Sweet	He said no new ‚Äúmap‚Äù announcement, but didn‚Äôt explicitly say anything about a new ‚Äúhero‚Äù.  Possibly getting hero 29 at blizzcon?
BiozZz	Theater mode in OW makes me üí¶
Joe 527	I hope Hero 29 Or Hero 30 Is A Dinosarur Ominc(mainy A T Rex Ominc)! If Not one of those Time I wait For Later!
sammy_owo_	did i just hear him say mercys getting a buff? blasphemy (thank you so much jeff)
Present Lee	Spectating eSport match is always what I want
bob hotpocket	dude put it at x2 speed and nothing is changed the video is way better
Procket22	Nerf Moira plz
The Undertaker	Buffed Roadhog......         Buffed Reaper also at the same time Classic Jeff
Sour Lemons	Don‚Äôt buff reaper
Daniel Carelli	Roadhog DOES NOT need buffs. His Survivability is already way too high, his ult is too long, his chain-kill combo is too brainlessly easy and reliable to spam.... WTF are you people thinking? He dominates every game he's in, and you're buffing him. Overwatch in a nutshell.
WhiteFire 121	Plz Buff Hammond Because he really does weak damage to Heroes...
Felipe Rodriguez	Why you hate me?, buff to symmetra.... really... REALLY JEFF?¬° or whoever this man is.
TimatorA	Calling it: Next map is assult and youre not announcing it because you dont want to get boo'ed
IDAVID29	Thanks papa Jeff
Marcus Tiratsuyan	Give me a reason to play the game, have a good time, and not have toxic teamates.
Flash Gordon	MERCY BUFF???
Pypedreams	Way into the camera thing that‚Äôs absolutely top! Thank you all
ItsNotYeAlt	Overwatch on the Switch will be hinted at Blizzcon. If this happens, I will lick my Switch on video. Not on this account though. On my other account.
ZombieKathren YT	Who dis? I don't know. He never say üò±
David E. Ali	Can't wait to see what Reaper's new buff is!
kisamesouth9000	You know what I like. I like how dragon Ball fighterz has a system to where you legit can earn everything with it's Halloween skins. I love overwatch. I really do but I ain't going to lie. I feel that they are expecting me to pay more and more and more to get the Halloween skins.
Prisinence	Good to know that you guys are focusing on balance like you said. *The majority of the video talking about esports-related stuff*
ZackAttack	This is big news for coaches and players who wanna learn from pros, imagine a Sombra player being able to spectate Surefour for an entire series!
meep	Yeah sure Jeff, mercy got a """"buff""""
Thrusful2	Can you put fusionator in the game
Zenvfefe	Didn't this basically already exist for Halo 3 back in '06/'07?
Kimsea Chea	Please focus less on the world cup and the league and make Overwatch fun to play again.
Martin Rantala	Jeff looks more happy this time
Bobbu Hill	Papi
Birkhoff Wayne	Papa Jeff would you might release a new hero..... üëÄ or a cinematic .... mercy? Please ‚ù§Ô∏è love you and the team good work. Birkhoff77 Xbox player.
Torquosis LivingManPerson	Oh Jeff...you're either tired or incredibly high. I'm leaning towards the latter.
Alex Adams	The colorblind options need to be improved. Barriers and hero effects need to be the color they are set to. Games get confusing.
McKidderZ	Jeff. You absolute god. Instead of nerfing the new characters and buffing the important characters *mercy*  they now add a twitch.tv optionüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº   Btw i love you jeff‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Moneymich 40	When is hero 29?
MINI	Fix Reinhardt bugs soon
Ty Miller	Still not enough to save the game. Add guilds, group queue, role queue, map picks, console attention, new competitive modes, permanent PvE, etc. to make me feel excited for OW again.
Eric Posey	but is it on twitch tho
SpencerLee97	#BuffBrigitte
Colin Worthington	Wait he didnt say no heroes are gonna be announced
Ludo Kanta	Super excited about the replay feature, but... can we NOT have any more maps at least for a while? Or / and restrict ranked to only 1 map per type per season? I'm having a really hard time learning properly the old maps while trying to keep up with the new ones and I've played since beta. I cannot imagine being a new player learning all the maps at once.
ice- poseidon	does anyone even care about this game? this channel cant even hit 100 thousand subs  :/
Ace Kix	Seriously, who is this? Voice of genji?
dudegamer 1	FIX SMURFING ON CONSOLE

Danny 7	Let us listen to the comms!!!!
Clluthu	wow the owwc feature is going to be crazy. streamers would be able to do their own streams and focus on what they feel the action is.  mercy buff! Wow they might make it so rez has no cast time in valk mode and possibly popping valk will reset the rez cd!
Ivan Roentgen	Extremely similar to Fortnite‚Äôs replay system.
bobsteventen's channel	Any news on the Tachanka rework?
Khun Khit	‚Äú of course we will be listening ptr feedback‚Äù  lol yeh cause you listened to bastion , mercy 2.0 and brig lol
Retromind	Did I just watch 8 mins of an advertisement?
OnionBun	viewer sounds dope.
Floor Slap	6:05 actual balance changes.
Get Quaked On	37 more bugs to fix on doomfist Jeff. You can do it, fix this terrible hero already.
GAMER LIFE	Jayne is gonna love this :)
EliteVeyron	"Can you imagine going and watching one of your own matches later, but being able to put the camera wherever you want in that replay view?"  Yeah I've played Rocket League before.  JK lol, I'm really excited for this new addition!
Nathan Truitt	He says can you imagine being able to replay one of your matches and being able to put the camera where you want it? Yes yes I can, because many other games have that feature
MidnightCrusader	yes yes yes plz
Myra	Just revert her hp/s to 60 :( That's all she needs

Q8 Rising	Buff symntra ??? Are you joking ?? She is super over power already and u just buffed her before 2 months ! Stop this nonsense ! Or because she is Indian and u r Indian you will always buff her !!!???? You are really killing the game without thinkibg
Da-Cat King	Wow... A mercy buff I can‚Äôt believe my ears
Sarasin	How was Everquest papa Jeff.
Mario Mentasti	Damnit... Gameplay Jeff. I don't care about the World Cup
Vince C	Yall a bunch (buff sym) of negative nancys (buff sym) cant you guys (buff sym) ever go one video (buff sym) with out criticizing the devs decisions(please buff sym)
Hunter Homes	Where are the overwatch comic's and shorts did you guys just stop caring if you did then why?.
Xeldris	Hbdbxjdbdhhsbbsjsjsjjdm REAPER BUFF! OhmyDog I‚Äôm nutting all over the place
Kim ERU	Where's 'I'm jeff from the Overwatch Team'
Synergie Dizz	All this wasted time, effort and resources into OWL that no one cares about. Fix your broken game instead, how bout that??  7minutes of talking without saying anything, things will stay broken as always lolol
Eduardo Garcia	What would be cool is when Mercy Ults, she gets 100 more health, and her healing ray heals everyone around the person as if shes healing some1 normally
Todd Odom	Ok, look, I know there's some important stuff coming to the game and all, but the new Lego Bastion doesn't transform. This is problem.
Drew Taraba	Dont want, fix console loading issues. Shouldn't have to wait through a 10 second black screen in the middle of a match
RewindCentral	LOL COPING F OK RTNITE WITH REPLAYS
TERABULL	Was anyone pogging out in chat or
TheMindfulOne	Either they are trolling us or this will be the worst blizzcon ever.  This is for every blizzard ip not just OW.  Little to nothing new for every single franchise.
Tim Tam Tanzyn	Omg mercy buffffffff
Travis M	I love how jeff acts as if they betas wer ever on console post release
fighting game lover	People still play this game? I‚Äôm legitimately impressed by the loyalty
Ramon Filipe	Mercy will gel some love!!! What a wonderful day!
SoloFiasco	MERCY BUFFS! Patch notes Mercy Increased Valkyrie duration by 1 sec Ok....
Strategist Robyn	Please tell me Mercy is getting her  blaster buff back.
TheGasPowered JohnnyJohn	Nerf widow's mobility, diamond and above widows are untouchable
Saber Pendragon	Symmetra buff woop woop! Hooray for all us shameless Symmetra mains :D
Bruiser Knight	But what about Bastion attack on the Winstons?
Levi Neff	Little known fact, every developer update blizzard turns the heat up one degree in order to keep up with Jeff Kaplan's desire to have a thin film of sweat surrounding his forehead, and keep up with the female demographic's demand.
Cosmic	I‚Äôll reinstall this game once you add more content to it.
Caminar	Still no Bastion buff :/ thx blizzard trash hero since day 1
RazrFalcon RazrFalcon	The World Cup viewer is actually nutty because if you want to study a pro players plays
Cooldiesel 28	GENJI NEEDS A SMALL BUFF JEFF GODDAMMIT

Kensen Wangkawinata	Hello stranger.
Raphael Alavi	Can we please get overwatch on the switch already? I just want to play as mccree with a mario skin.
Derpsadoo DerpyMcderpdoop	What is this ‚ÄúMercy buff‚Äù? I thought she only got nerfed.
Jose Ayon	Symmerta buff?!? Ima stop playing if that happens
Exalted Exile	Yes
Siiri Malmberg	*Mercy* *buffs* ? Lets go Huge rez
Peter Gardner	This is simply genius and I‚Äôm excited!
cgcoyote cow	My thought on the mercy buff:  It doesn‚Äôt help at all and its making me pissed off. I hardly ever play the game anymore because the bandage fixes are not fixing the bleeding holes that they have left in the game. Before brigetta (probably didn‚Äôt spell that right) things seemed fairly balanced and dive comp was the only problem. Ana needed a buff but mercy didn‚Äôt need that nerf. Just admit that you made a mistake and make mercy viable again. Wtf blizzard. You are more connected to your audience than most other game companies yet you listen a lot worse than most do.
Louis Cheung	Please add the mini map feature in the game!!!
Yiyosk o	FINALLY!
Caleb Collier	You tricked me that thumbnail wasn't a new hero
AndrykMcTv	Oh great, another esport update that does not adress the issue with the lack of lore or the repetitive events in the game... Yay!
Ethan Martinez	Clans???
The_Best_Common 556	If symetra gets a buff I‚Äôm quitting
FTWItachiPlays	Looking to watch Overwatch and other content? come check us out!!!
switcheroo	Jeff: buffs mercy that girl aria: creates a 10min video bitching out not being grateful for the upcoming buffs since it doesn‚Äôt include mass rez   fight me
sebas5823	This is how ignorant people knows that bliz keeps working
Grant Schuler	I went to Ult as DVA on top of one of the buildings next to the second point on Hollywood. As I shot my mech out, it LAUCNHED me out of the map, and I have it recorded....
Teh Arbitur	Praise Jeff!
Nytellem	*MCREE NEEDS A BUFF!!!* The more I play FFA with him the more I understand how OUTCLASSED and USELESS he is in this era of Overwatch. Dont get me wrong hes a great character but hes a man out of time. 6 shots does nothing against teleporting, soul stealing, 30m shotgun shooting, ice freezing, rapid arrow firing, Machine Machine gun melting, flying rockets, bear trapping grenade shooting, Melting core and stupid aim bot bot, Big fisting, People in this GAME!. Your just out matched in EVERY WAY possible. I say give him more Health, or lower the cool time on flashbang, OR give McCree two Flashbangs like you did with Junkrat giving him TWO OP mines.
Angelina Sisk	I have the moira skin in the thumbnail
Marlene Vale	I almost fell out of my chair when he said Mercy was getting a buff. I‚Äôm not going to get my hopes up, so I‚Äôll reserve judgment until I can see what they‚Äôre actually buffing.   Edit: just read the notes and I‚Äôm underwhelmed
Nia Castro	This is actually really exciting!!!! I‚Äôm excited to see how this will develop into a new feature. Good job OW team
carlos E	SYM DOES NOT NEED A BUFF
KittenMoon505	REAPER AND MERCY ARE GETTING BUFFS?!!!....-faints as they are my two mains-
Doggo Universe	FINALLY A BUFF FOR HER
Desai Holland	This is awesome
Miss Guardian Angel	YESSSS IN EXCITED FOR THE OVERWATCH WORLD CUP VIEW
Mocita	"Roadhog and Mercy are discussed more than other heroes"  You obviously haven't been reading the forums. There's a new Symmetra thread pretty much every hour!
Jesse ST	The reason Mercy‚Äôs getting a buff is cuz this wasn‚Äôt Jeff from the Overwatch team.
Epicwin0311	PAPA JEFF :D
Coollizzylou	this should definitely be a feature in the all access pass!
Rob Ikari	THANK YOU GOD! MERCY BUFFS VERY SOON...GOD EXISTS!!!
Suzushiiro	Y'all should totally try to add this feature to Starcraft/HotS.
Chainer	Ah, another middle finger to console players, excellent.
Daniel amaral	We need the intro "this is Jeff from the overwatch team"!
Spoopy_boy	Hello there person scrolling through the comments like if you think Jeff is not a human.
TheAtomicClock	I really wish you guys would stop buffing Sym.
randomguythatwatchesyoutube	Buff for mercy?! What had Overwatch turned into?!
brilliantlysplendid	First the torb rework, then the colorblind options, now a sym buff? Jeff please you're buffing me quite a bit already
Sai Girap	Y U NO SAY "JEFF FROM THE OVERWATCH TEAM"
TheCrafter 2000	You have got to find a way to get this stuff on console too its so unfair
Groove Crusader	When will it be live for console?
Kill4rz	hope this means more dinoflask videos
Lynxion	MERCY BUFFSSS
pandulce	So will I ever be able to play PC OW with a PS4 remote?
RozyWolf	Yes, Mercy and Symmetra buff! Can't wait!
Raylene garcia	More Esports features. Smh
Link_x2	Next we are going to have replays of Blizzcon where you can move your drone around the the event
Thom Beacock	Who else is hyped for the new Overwatch LEGO sets coming out next year?
m0nkeyboi_ _	k daddy jeff
Seto	If god isn‚Äôt real then why is mercy being buffed?
YXY	great
Lucy Heartfilia	I wish they would put Tracers pulse bomb back to the way it was.
Sania Chaudhry	I regret leaving Overwatch for ^shivers^Fortnite. I‚Äôm coming back! Wish me luck
MINT	Im tired of the OWL and the OWWC. I just want more content to the main game. More events, maps, heroes and lore. It feels like 90% of the focus is on the leagues or world cup. And i dont play either of those! like the other 99% of the player-base.
Centz	This is fake. Nice edit though but Papa Jeff won't say "Mercy Buff".
Caetano Matos	REPLAY SYSTEM!!! IT'S HAPPENING!!!!!
Dakota Gerrior	2 times speed makes it sound like a normal person and saves you time :)
Swagalis Goodra	REVERT SOMBRA!!!!!!  Please Jeff. Why are high skill cap characters so bad to you. You made hanzo easier and sombra easier. Fix her bugs and los bs and 2 sec hack bs and revert her
beerasaurus	I hope they finally removed mercy's Rez and made valk power up those around her kinda like the medic uber.
Asher King	Only now do game devs realize how cool theater mode in Halo was. Even the halo devs forgot
quesadillaking	"Fix your game"  *hands you a fancy new camera* keep watching our game with this kthxbai
patri	nice !
Get Marioed	He was dancing around teasing a new hero
Ego Banana	Beta cup.
AJ	YESSS BUFFS TO SYMMETRA & MERCY!!!
WarlordSquerk	A lot of really awesome stuff there. Shame they're going for a valk buff instead of a revert and patch, and no mention of bastion. So I guess I'll still avoid playing the game for the most part. But that said, a quick dev update, buffs to several heroes people have been asking for for a long time, the viewer tool eventually coming to my local games. A lot of good there. A big step in the right direction.
La Pal	Sooo this new spectator mode. Will we get to have it in OWL as well? And will it be locked behind the all access pass?
Negative Ives	I hope the reaper buff is a fix to his teleport.  Its fine that he can't be detected as quickly as before, but the major problem I have with it as it stands is that he is a sitting duck if anyone sees his destination.  I'm not saying make it so its instantaneous, though as a Reaper main, that would be fantastic for me, but even having less aura would be better suited for him.  Here are other things I would like them to look at, but not necessarily needed buffs/fixes for him:  Teleport Mid-Air - the option if your quick enough to save yourself from falling off a cliff from a random Lucio boop.  Less Shotgun spread, or piercing damage through shields(5-10 percent)  3 second invincibility upon Shadow Step, to fix the issue with him being a sitting duck.  Damage Resistance while using his ultimate, 10 percent.  Okay, I cheated on this one and took it from the forums.  Since he is shifting in and out of Wraith form while using his ultimate, it makes sense to have some small damage resistance.
heyb0o0o0o0o0o0osS	Real question is Jeff, Emre when?
Cheese 4 Hire	Dev update on my b day poggers
danzels bignatefc	I don't care about owl. lore, more tanks
sgomez8194	that replay system I hope they implement it to all games in OW. It will be amazing to be able to analyze every game after it ends and see what mistakes were made.
MrMcPizza	As long as you don't touch Moira I'll keep playing
Nisselak	A Mercy buff!?!?! The world is going to end
ebony robinson	Can we just go back to Mercy 1.0 or Mercy 2.0 after the first nerf PLEASE. Then again Mercy 2.0 was fine the way it was when it released, but that's just my opinion.
Echo Atlantian	Woah i can learn how to be a better lucio now instead of watching libero for half an hour lul
Handled Quasar	The game feels the same from the start
KandyK1ng	Lucios Amp It Up should be 10 instead of 12 v(-_-)v but that's just a suggestion
Mr Verve	ROADIE MAINS UNITE
KASH	YES!
Peter Wilkinson	It would be cool if you could share replays too. Like if I wanted to share a replay on a fourm or something.
Xlamop	MERCY BUFF OMEGALUL!!!!
Mike Perreman	Developer update, but nothing new is behind a paywall?  Suspicion increased
Dwevy	I'm probably in the minority but I struggle to play overwatch due to many reasons. I'm pretty mediocre at it and I do struggle against classes that stun me and teleport such as genji. But the one thing I wish could be toned down is the visual clutter, Moira's ultimate just makes an already chaotic game (for me) seem even more overwhelming.
Bes7iA	WHO ARE YOU!?
Carrot Tropolis	YESSSS I cannot wait for that gameplay replay feature. I've wanted something in Overwatch like that for a while :)
Grace Reed	10 bucks saying that the Valkyrie ultimate can let you rez a bunch of people at once again.
Sasaki	Oh hey they did that thing I suggested ages ago. Just like DoTA 2. Congrats bois.
Lonz Ponz	Reapers buff!?! Gtfo
Brian Hess	I've been wanting a viewer like that for a while. I think it will really help get more viewers of the Overwatch League.   As happy as I am for that can we please get more lore. I really want to know more about the Overwatch universe and how we got to where we are. I think there is a real thirst for it out there.
Nabeel Hamzah	NERF AKALI
Raine Bow	Uh oh they‚Äôre changing Mercy, yet AGAIN.
Twisted Fate the Card Master	wait a minute       *MERCY AND BUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF?!?!?!?*
IconoclastXVII	Is there a mailing list for those of us waiting for you to focus on the game instead of your forced esport attempt? I hit a point about a year ago where I was bored with the game but the events were keeping it alive, and now you aren't even doing any new events. No wonder everyone is switching to Fortnite
Edgard Villa	Jeff hates console confirmed
Alex Campbell	As long as Wold Cup is on YouTub I can Watch it.
Toaster	sounds amazing, i don‚Äôt know why that wasn‚Äôt a feature to begin with.
tehshingen	You guys need to call the Overwatch replay viewer the "Overwatcher".
Midnight_BlazeZm	As a reaper main I believe that this is a OK buff for reaper but it's not the problem that reaper is facing. It's either buff his ult or rework his shadow step but this is just my opinion and I thought it would be cool for reaper to make illusions or even decoys but that's just me.
Devs	CAN we plz have JEFF FROM THE OVERWATCH TEAM back? This guy bored me to death.
_Rave _	Wait did they miss the fact that brig is no longer a support but a dps?
Hal Yolo	Stop buffing reaper Jeff I will slap you in the face
Cody Walker	What I want: Pls have a hero that requires skill  What I get: ‚ÄúIntroducing hero 29, Broira‚Äù
Siwena	This is so freaking cool, finally able to watch the hero I want !! with the angle I want. ‚ô• u jeff
Trish La	WHY WOULD YOU BUFF SYMMETRA!? üò≠
Michael Dodaro	Sick update for the pov spectator mode!
PaperPatriot	I've never seen anyone actively requested a new map, it's gotta be one of the least anticipated things. Sure they're cool when they arrive but before then I don't think anyone really cares.
Fade	Dang, not even the old intro. LMAO
UnusedWings	One of my big questions: Will the community being able to spectate these games LIVE in the client, messing with camera angles and such, at all affect the actual players, such as latency issues and the like?
Ben Parker	Thanks for the update Jeff can't wait to try out this new spectator mode!
The Shadow Master	Mercy getting buffed ? I never thought I'd hear those words together in a sentence like that from Jeff
Francisco Romero	NEW ANIMATION PLEASE, GIVE LORE TO MCREEE, ZEN PLEASE
shadowXtras	6:00  For those who want to hear about balance changes.
NWinnStudio	*Overwatch World Cup Viewer*
Jay Jay	Mercy buffs? Oh please give us back the 60hps daddy Jeff..

Waaday Forrester III	jeff needs more sleep
NERF MERCY	Pls BUFF mercy
VCorleone 1	All mercy mains redownload the game
XL B	Can you please also care about the game in general and it's lore?
Juan Caro	The overwatch beta viewer makes me intrested in watching. I never cared about esports but the fact that i can view and pay attention to things I want to look at such as pro plays to get better etc.
Sastank08	Delete Brig
Furtive Pygmy	Nerf Hanzo jeff!
Aemon Gregoire	this will really help the editing community a lot too. I love watching overwatch edits even if they're scarce and far between but this will certainly bring a boost in quality and the number of edits out there so thank you
Sgt Morfokiller	After I recently see some images of the Queen of Junkertown around that map, I have the urge to know more about her.
TJ Singleton	I just want Banshee Moira to scream.
Joseph Salazar	When Blizzcon is literally next week
Not Vex	HE DIDN‚ÄôT SAY IT, HE ALWAYS SAY‚ÄôS ITüò±
Peppermint	hey, im not sure if you have enough resources to put into it, but could we get an optimization update at some point? I feel like there has been a slow decline within game quality since oasis has been released. (also pls make roadhog more consistent with his weapon spread the hog mains are v sad)
Zwordsman	I still wish that Mercy's heal and power up were the same beam, and the alt fire.. actually gave her a defensive measure. Since she doesn't heal the most directly anymore-and is also the only one who can't self preserve while healing. (i.e. she can't heal and weave in attacks. Switching weapons takes rather long compared to anything else)
„Ç≠„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éã„É£„Éº	reaper and sym buffs ? *sigh* they fell to the forum criers
Pixel_Vengeur	The OWC spectator mode looks sounds SOOOOOOOO good! Thank you for that!
PineappleLord	Another tranny?
Hanzo Reaps_OW	Guest characters COMFIRMED?!?
Im bird	OOHH.. yes
Yolo	Hey Jeff!!! Fix Bastion.
Clifford Jones	OMFG ITS HAPPENNING
AlchemE	Overwatch on Nintendo Switch!
SportyN	I was so scared Jeff was going to say that they weren‚Äôt going to announce a hero
Xero-Space	Bring Jeff back to the World of Warcraft team and make it great again
dragoneyes22	I wish consoles got it...
NV DaviMotion	Watching our own replays from any angle? OH, you mean like we could already do in Halo 3 10 YEARS AGO???
Cancerino	Who is this man? And what is that red triangle on his head!?
Alwayz Silent	Can Symmetra get more love??
Genji Brick	Do you think you could try to put overwatch on the switch I love overwatch but I have a Nintendo switch   Btw you awesome jeff
P1ayer76	allow a way to earn in game currency besides just by getting them in chest    like challenges
Mejar	Right when I saw Jeff‚Äôs face I yelled: JEFF!
Chromosome Factory	Jeff, for Mercy you pronounced nerfed wrong
Michael Krikorian	Hog changes?
Mr Tosic Gaming	Freaking awesome
Andrew Sparacino	still nothing for rein??? omegalul
TheRubyGames	But will we get league credits for viewing the games from the player
MR-moosab	Ÿàÿ¥ ŸäŸÇŸàŸÑ ÿ∞ÿß ÿüÿü
SIREN27	‚ÄúTo be honest‚Äù has been added to his dictionary
Kaxy	What about new hero? If you need to be exact that there won't be a new map than there will be a new hero
Gladen	Can we move half of the OWL team back in the OW team already, the content got really boring, the lore became not as good and technically nonexistent. And balance changes are a joke, mercy and buff does not fit in the same sentence along with sym. IS HER TURRET NOT ENOUGH AND DOES IT DO NOT ENOUGH DAMAGE JEFF. Brigg still does everything, we don't want her shield to be nerfed, it's her shield bash, we don't want the cooldown it's the range, she travels for like a mile then makes you unable to move then smack u in the face with that whip, and inspire, the healing is insane, it does too much, make it do less, brigg does everything, do the same to her as you did to mercy thank you, some players are in masters cause they one trick this hero. GL blizzard with helping the OW community. Just focus on OWL, it's not like we the player base were the ones giving you money. Go ahead. And please no one uses LFG anymore and queue time for a QUICK PLAY which was 3 seconds back in the day is now 4-5 minutes. Proves how much this game has "improved"
Hung Dang	This is a lie. The buff is just an excuse to nerf her again to her grave after. DO NOT GET EXCITED
rioluking	finally got a functioning replay system after only literally forever
Steve Robinson	Hoping to hear about a Nintendo Switch version of Overwatch at Blizzcon.
danman1012	Jeff, kys loser.
clubt gamer	Dead dead dead
Angelina Lim	Why no doom fist nerf?
Grovy Sparky	And What About a Torbj√∂rn Buff... Since that Rework He becames the Worst character EVER... And i'm a True Torb Main (Turret Lv3 Saving Matches)
Leon Mckeever	Could be the future of eSports if this goes well, can get rid of the problem of TTours
Mariocat99	hope for mentions about overwatch on switch *not paladins*
Starman45	You see how he chokes up at 3:11. It's almost as if he can't fathom anyone not being interested in eSports.
TheUndeadGentleman	Are they seriously trying to sell the idea of match replays as an innovative new feature? I could do that over a decade ago back when games like Halo 3 and TF2 were new and it was a pretty standard feature even back then.
Gregory Chen	AWESOME, but idk if blizz servers will be able to take it...
sug	BUFFS for sym . I don't care what they say, there is no way on earth that blizzard plays their own game.
Agent G	A mercy buff? HEROES NEVER DIE
Evan Hodgson	That is amazing
NinjAsaya	The only thing that people should care about is better tickrate server and MAJOR changes for ladder. When Jeff will announce that they are taking balance seriously and they will act quicker than before (instead of waiting 8months for a fix)? Saying they will listen to feedback for ptr is an absolute joke...It is sad, it is triggering and I know a bunch of casual/subredditoverwatch people will hate on me for this but it's the truth. I think the game is awesome but blizzard is killing it.
Zotur	not removing brig wtf this video is useless.
trebo dipo	Why reaper he is already broken
Luis Padilla	Mercy buff let me guess her damage will go up 0.0000000001% but to conterbalance this when she uses rez she will have stand perfectly still for 3 mins while surround by 4 bulleyes that can be seen for 5 miles away and hanzo auto hits with 1.5 million in damage ...
Mathew Begnoche	Haven't seen any ptr changes not make it to live.
MarvelFan0112	I PLAY CONSOLE!!!!!!!
NoSuch Name	Can you include s76 buff too. His ult is kinda no no to this recent patch.
„Ç´„Ç∫„Éà	What about guilds
Foxeqois	Who's mercy? You mean that walking health pack?
Elmo What	Fortnite had this first but with match you played
Ariel M	Yayyyy Mercy is getting a buff <333
Epic PHail	Make new modes for seasonal events üôÑ
Something Different	Quick question, why does Symmetra‚Äôs beam charge her ammo but her orbs don‚Äôt? Aren‚Äôt they made of the same substance? :Thinking:
BlackFyre	Hero releases have slowed, now map releases are being delayed. Player base is leaking out and no new game modes. Overwatch is dying...
Tony Merriweather	They‚Äôre so focused on overwatch league it‚Äôs gross. They could care less about us casual players.
Justin Hiryu	He did not deny a new hero, guys. Get hype!
Bilkis Habid	I'm interested in the reaper buff
ZWar101	the overwatch world cup viewer thing sounds like a terrible idea, how will the servers handle it?? thats insane! if they pull it off thatd be legendary though.
windthugness	Give roadhog a 5000 hp shield ,double the length of his hook , and whoever is in line of it gets hooked
Orientedmine	Theatre mode. Mercy buff.  Hog buff.  No new map for Blizzcon. But he didn't say now new hero therefore new hero confirmed for blizzcon
Breanna Lude	Hi
Ben Zaffrann	Not sure about reaper and sym. I feel they're in a good spot rn. But hog and mercy buffs are definitely a good decision.
Maxim Daigle	This felt kind of useless
Sick Wit it	Stop saying mercy got a buff, it‚Äôs not, her ult is  just going back to what it use to be. That ult barley helped the teams turn fights around. Give her a real buff!
SealableMite61	The lard king lives and symmetra... let‚Äôs see what they‚Äôll do with her
DEADPOOL wrestler	2:47 No Flash point people.
Stay_Cute	buff mercy i dont care about the rest, k bye
Bacon Bernstein	DON'T BUFF MERCY PLEASE, THE MOTH CAN DO DIE IN A HOLE
Rodolfo Castro	Bastion rework when?
Zannmaster	Azerite armor sucks! Opps wrong channel...
Alex Xela	i dont know, but a big part of the worldcup is the hype from the commentators/fans, which is entirely missing. i would personally rather watch the stream because of it. Watching replays after the matches/streams or during a break seems like a nice addition though
The Coca Cola Bear	Nobody cares about  Overwatch League  Nobody cares about Competitive  Nobody cares about the events   This game dead
Hayden	I'd be happy if the mercy buff is just her previous healing/s, she's more useful as a damage buff and rez than a healer currently. Hoping this "buff" gives us Mercy players some satisfaction again
CyclopsPilot	Mercy get a buff?hmmmmm
kamuishr3	No map for BC, but not saying anything about new hero
jcbvickers	Please don't buff Symmetra again she is already broken
Brisk Pepper	I effing love Jeff Kaplan
FLARZz	And back to ‚Äúcan we get a mercy?‚Äù we go...üò™

Tobey Martin	Daddy jeff, back at it again
Chris Dilbeck	Any system to deal with Roadhog's tendency to feed ultimate charge to the other team?
The Big Yawn	"whats that? you want a buff to mercy?" "ok well buff her useless ult lol gottem"
–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤	Spend four minutes instead of saying directly about the server replay test ...
ending heartfelt	MERCY BUFF BOYS
An√∏n	Who dat man no Jeff from overwatch team?

deltaracoon 3920	WTF JEFF!!! WE DONT WANT THEM BUFFED, WE WANT BRIG, MOIRA, AND SYM NERFED OR TAKEN OUT!!!! we just want skillful overwatch back man, the meta is so skill less. I just want it to be skillful.....
Frisky Fudge	Next update: Symmetra is now a tank/sniper and she can deploy 69 torb turrets that stun the enemy every shot
Nam Nguyen	Has anyone seen Jeff? I like the new guy that's updating for us, strong voice and everything. I miss you Jeff. Press F.
Josh Egli	This replay system is going to be game changing. Thank you for giving us this gift Jeff and the rest of the team, I'm extremely excited!
CamTheKitty	It is a bit strange that the tone deaf and miniscule Mercy buff had "but this may not stay" added onto it
BaM_BaM1125	As a spray hunter/Moira main, why not NERF the requirements to obtain her cute spray??? I‚Äôm sure no one else probably feels this way, but 40+ hours of play and still no cute spray, it‚Äôs getting a little annoying imho.
Badger McWaffles	These are great. Cant wait to test it out as well as ty for letting us know not to get "too" hyped for a map or such just yet. Cant wait!
Kibeth	I hope it's a complete rework of Valkyrie, because in its current state it's one of the most brain-dead boring ults in the game
musty	GIMME THAT REAPER BUFF
Lazy Unicorn	MERCY YES MERCY AAAAAAHHHHH
Hobi's Jams	Cheers jeff

Diego T. Yamaguchi	delette brigette
Jason Calderon	Rhe new hero in overwatch is NINOOOOOOO
DarKNesss	finally spectator system has been implanted it's a system i'm really need for long time finally i can watch my favorite player in their perspective. speaking of which by watching from in-game does this mean we have option to turn off custom colors ? that we would always usually see ? like i'm cool with their costume that representing their country and color outline for separate both team  but smoking from gun or explosion and effect color and mercy healing beam or damage buff beam changes are too much  (at least those 2 things are what i can't tell difference without paying attention)
Ian Rundell	Reaper buff üòõü§©üòàüòà
NooberNerd	Who ASKING for this OWWC Feature? Pros, Esports Fans. It's clear now that these game will focus Esport rather than lore and QoL for all player. Feature for a small group players, bad decision again.
Santiago Legro Zapata	Buffgenji
Quincy Walls	Cool üëçüíñüéÆ
Mexican Who Can't Speak Spanish	Delete Brigitte

Eric Miksanek	Don‚Äôt want to watch other people play. Who fkn cares?!?!
üòê	Me A Sym/Mercy Main: OMG they finally buffed both Sym and mercy they must‚Äôve listened to the feedback! Oh wait the buffs are legit nothing.  Mercy is still an off healer. Sym is still a borderline throw pick 90% of the time.
Max Hyunsue	Lol pay attention to your game, not just the overwatch league.
Winston Master	It would be nice if overwatch actually listened to community and added more gameplay elements like maps and heroes and more LORE instead of useless social instruments and replay systems lmao
MickeyBoi	Ffs plz nerf Brigitte

WTF !	Uhg I have  to get used to another Symmetra update  (‚ï•_‚ï•)
Richard Ordaya	Is there any type of pro scene for console players? I know they arent as good as PC but they should be given a chance to show off their skill. Some console players have a dream of becoming pro without a PC.
Jazzy Cat	Jeff, babe, instead of some new maps, ima ask if we could have a *spicy* hot torbjorn bikini skin
Natalie Ward	just @ stylosa next time lmao

Nicholas Pentowski	"Were buffing mercy" explain this atheists
Zander q	how cool would it be if like special items dropped while the live game is going on...like csgo how they would drop the souvenir crates maybe it could drop a special world cup skin or loot box or maybe a 2x xp for a hour or something think it would be awesome
jkSam	jeff the best game dev
Ahmed Adel	another dev effort on e-sports! ... Wake-up the game-play is now awful and generally the game is dying fast
Eamon Bolger	Gee Jeff thanks for this new feature that is totally useless ur the greatest!
Wolf 612	Did he just say ‚Äúbuff‚Äù and ‚ÄúMercy‚Äù in the same sentence
ARMY	Two heroes instead of a new map?

Calebasouras  Caleb	Mercy gets a buff my heart me heart I‚Äôve never been so revived
Gothic 83	Jeff i think you ment to say nerf to mercy because you want no one to play as her ever #mercy1.0
Scribs	*Cough cough* GOTV! *cough cough*
Daniel Gomez	if you want to skip around on topics on this short 8 minute video: - 0:18 : Overwatch World Cup Viewer (also kinda the replay system) - 4:30 : No new map announced at BlizzCon (sorry bois) - 6:05 : Talk of Balance changes <really a buff to Valk? Where are the other 10 kits you said you had, Id love to try them out on ptr, you dont have to put those kits through to live just let us try them :( >  - 7:20 : Thank you & recap thing
dale515100	OWl Wiil be the death of overwatch...
Mac Gaulin	You should add the World Cup Viewer to Google's Project Stream so I can watch via client from Chrome at work. I mean at a coffee shop. Not at work.
CFxRenaissance	Junk Queen confirmed?!?
Hill	lol match demo has been in valve games since 2000. This should have been added in day one
PelleStrandberg	well thats great for the 5 people that watches OW esports.

Keelin M	Theater mode in overwatch would be so useful in many different ways like coaching people and seeing your game for mistakes or just exploring the maps further
Tijuanaparte	Mercy will get a buff? Is this Jeff from the Overwatch team????
Bandy Popen	Overwatch is awesome
Raiden x3	Just nerf Pharah
Triskan	Holy sh... that's everything I've been asking to follow the matches the way they should be watched !
Joel Cespedes	So really. Just 85% OWL and social changes. Overwatch is slowly turning into money instead of content. Basically, the event this year was skins a new map change, super small changes and that's it. Not even a comic. I'm sorry but if Overwatch keeps going like this I'm going to stop playing it. They're starting to care less about content, and more on OWL.  Just my opinion, they're getting lazy on content.
Nihilstsauce	I really hope this is integrated into owl season 2
Josiah Fincham	Galaxy mega brain viewer.
Paul Kim	Ah i see, still no role queue or map pool. Cool.
Ari	2:41 Oh no. Jeff what have you done? What are you doing with your hand? Dinoflask, have mercy on Jeff, please!
Tanguy Aerts	hopefully you won't paywall the owwc viewer....
Zarguz Hedwaka	Please rework briggite so the game is fun again

Jack	Expect patches for ...... and mercy.   Noooooooooooooooo
JFn Cho	drink every time he says "watch"
Nick Landers	‚ÄúWe have a buff for Mercy‚Äôs Valkyrie. We are playing around with how it works‚Äù  Community: ‚ÄúmeRcY iS wAaAaAy ToO oP!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe have decided to nerf mercy because the players are complete morons and can‚Äôt figure out how to kill supports during a fight  Also, we‚Äôve decided to give Reaper the ability to one shot every hero in the game. We know he‚Äôs not strong enough, so we‚Äôre really happy with his new changes‚Äù
MobNic Gaming	The spectator mode should be part of the OWL as well
MultiBLC	thats stupid and why i dont play it anymore (im a console player)
snaggiz	He blinks like.. a lot.
Blackram Art	My fav symmetra is getting buff yeah
Brett Wilkins	Mercy bufff!!! So excited!
DaRkHunTer0125	Are we getting a shotgun character, Jeff? I mean like a real classic FPS shotgun?! Pump-Action! Maybe they pull out a double barrel super shotty for their ultimate? I can dream.
Imagine Dragonites	DONT BUFF MERCY PLEASE!
Jaimie	Coaching the many got a buff bois
Day Drunk	Mercy and symmetra buffs üôåüèªüôèüèªüíÖüèªüíÉüèªü§ó

billdolphin2316	Adding theater mode from halo to overwatch league. Aight
Noristar	Please I miss Mercy so much. ;w;
Brandon Kleyling	C‚Äômon man, where‚Äôs the Heavy update? Scream Fortress 2018 doesn‚Äôt add a whole lot, and we haven‚Äôt gotten much since Jungle Inferno.
LucioOh5	Hopefully D.mon will be a playable hero soon.
Mitchell l	I LOVE JEFF!
Mercy Main B Like	THANK YOU MY LORD AND SAVIOR JEFF FOR BUFFING MERCY
Cal Erba	Symmetra needs to be nerfed not buffed...her turrets are too strong, whether you drop the damage they do or their health, 1 of those things needs to drop....
Andrew Beck	Turn up Mercy overall healing by 5 hps?
Mantol	Doesnt Kaplan look like Jeff Goldblum
KirbZ	Did i just hear reaper buff?.. As a reaper main thats all i needed to hear üòÇ
GoldenSlowbro	My girls are finally getting fixed!!!
Leonardo Urr	Isn't EVERYTHING for PC #saveconsolelives
V01d5t0rm 2003	ALL HAIL JEFF! ALL HAIL JEFF! ALL HAIL JEFF!
Ian Shaw	so no hero 29 just yet? thats okay,  but i really wish its someone new to the lore of overwatch instead of junker queen.
Drew Carney	Finally!!! I've been waiting for this new view for ages
Nadine Smith	fingers crossed for hero 29
TH00PERMAN onXBL	Can we watch from *2nd person?*
CMG	Overwatch League next year is going to be interesting indeed ....
zachandbro	That is a great way to change perspectives without being constricted
3lit3gn0m3	Nice, sounds like a tough system to implement.   Not to detract from it....but please fix the daily arcade slot. It barely runs half the available modes, and really doesn't seem 'arcadey' at all. As a kid, the arcade meant variety, and while I understand not having ALL modes 24/7, right now the variance is extremely minimal.   For example, having 2 event modes and the other 3 ALL being 'mystery ______.' It tells me that Blizzard is more concerned with 'popular' modes for all slots than giving niche 'fun' modes more chances....like 6v6 elim. 1v1 duels pop up a lot, or even too much at times.   I've been asking about this for months, and honestly don't think I should expect anything.   :(
Kaleb cline	Omg this sounds amazing. I‚Äôd love to just watch the players I love
Fowl	I'm really hyped and gratefull for the review system! But lets please not forget about brig being *still* far too powerfull. While the changes to the supports and dps have been great so far, brig needs to be addressed for there to be a decent balance between all roles.
Lukas Senesac	Hey Jeff! Why don't you use your resources to give EVERYONE a replay for their own matches...what a waste...
chillywilly1321	Replay is great Jeff, but where‚Äôs the Lore?!
skArpPT	This game is dead, please delete it.
FadiCrafter	I can‚Äôt wait for stylossa to talk about the same thing except the video will be twice as long as this one.
TwinkleToes	Holy Guacamole this sounds great!
Shadowgalaxy	sty must be WOKE
ZenGotBars	THEATER MODE 2.0!               Time to study JJoNaK!
Bubba Falcon	Am I in the minority that reaper doesn't need a buff
Comrade Dan	More tedious world-cup bloat. You're letting your game get away from you.
Cole.Finnegan	So is anyone not being able to join teams in quick play and arcade ?
Jose Aguilar	You guys should make a hero that is made or shots fire as a counterpart to mei and is inspired from Diablo or something it could be really cool
Degrees 7	AMAZING! Im a main tank and normally in streams they don't focus too much on tanks. Now I will be able to understand what pro's do
RPenguin ;w;	MERCY BUFF
Zeo988777	Reaper buffs? Reaper? Buffs? There is a god!
Soup Or Man	Will there be an option to enable the shout casters and commentators as I still want to hear them, even though I want to view the match from the battle.net client from my own ‚Äòcamera‚Äô
badassnewbie	plz no dont buff symm, she's the most annoying character to play against
TerminatorTay	Jeff- "balance changes.."... Me- OKay so another Mercy Nerf.... Jeff-" buffs to...and Mercy"...... *calls 911 to pick me up off the floor*
Coucou OW	Nerf doomfist¬†and brigitte already..¬†Overwatch developers only care about esports not the balance of the game and the community's feedback.. it's so sad
Slips	I have never heard of GOTV or csgo before, no idea what that is
John Williams	The buff to nurfcy should just take away her healing staff.
UNLISTEDGHOST	...kill mercy
Wolfgang Widhalm	Sym needs a nerf, she is in almost all quick play and low rank games and it is not fun to play against
Code EDM	well, replay system basically confirmed as upcoming social feature.....
Qrow Let's Plays	sure there is not going to be an new map i get you jeff.
sergioygkeke	hi jeff.  please confirm   from the case of  market history of ....    Nox and Diablo 2 .  ur sincerely.
Where is lamp	Just wait theres another Mercy nerf   this. is. a. joke.
george brownsea	Bet Brigitte wont be fixed
Ra Canum	This is gunna be so poggers for the ow league if/when it makes it there, going to just watch from furys perspective 99 percent of the time but be so good just floating around above sometimes or just doing it where you would stand if you where in the game. And mercy and roadhog should be interesting, valks still pretty decent imo but roadhogs going to be a welcome change, as an off tank only really play him junkertown or well and even then end up swapping back to dva straight away half the time. And hes such a throw the rest of the time, i dont mind flexing if we get a dva, or zarya giving she can work, but when its roadhog its just this tilting state where you dont want to main tank for them because the off tank is still crucial and they wont be doing that job but going double off tank with a road is sooo trash
Zodi	I'm 1000% gunna keep the camera on my philly boys
SirReasoner	lol symmetra buff gg
Sushi Sushi	MAKE A BATTLE ROYALE MODE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Xkore1	Buffs to Symmetra. Another pointless 2m primary fire range buff or will it be something that will actually fix her?
Anthony Bacilio Ruiz	The replay will take us to another level boss
Carson Jones	So I might've missed him saying this, but will the Overwatch World Cup Viewer be on console after the beta or will it always be exclusive to PC?
It's Raining Men	Stop revealing your skins days ahead of an event, maybe it'll help prolong ow's life.
Forest Skilbred	Woah, Symmetra and Reaper buffs I wasn't expecting. Cool.
Pedro Moraes	Omg this new feature looks rad.
Jonerico	So you can watch the world cup, you can watch esports inside the game! YET YOU CANT READ THE COMICS THAT ADD TO THE ACTUAL LORE TO YOUR GAME IN YOUR GAME! *NICE!!1!*     Symmetra buff, autoaim hoover again!!1!!1
Eric Buckner	Do a new character like a ant man like character
-WiLd3R- 99	This is too good
Danklord1986	Can't wait for the dinoflask version
Pedoro Santosu	Buffing Mercy for the 10millionth time. üëç
JustJaySama	Bring this feature to comp matches so I can watch my friends play comp
Matthew Phillips	Mercy? Buffs? What happened to the real Jeff?
pickachu soulreaver	What mercy getting a buff üò± thats a surprise
PotatoHentai 69	All hail lord Kaplan
Genectro	This not jeff??
Maeve	useless dev update. okay.
sultan	Buff reaper= more powerful than he is now<< but why blizzard = because the overwatch league teams never play reaper. Blizzard (we want to balance the game and fuck you up. Rip tanks
pdiddy	bring back old tracer PepeHands
Snapped Back	GUYS did I hear it right? A BUFF for Mercy? No no no, that‚Äôs....that‚Äôs never happened before. Are we sure he didn‚Äôt mean nerf?
BattousaiHBr	so is this basically the dota2 spectator mode? always thought it was awesome.
THE BEST Lombax	I want tell something about figures! Could you make mega bloks figures like mega bloks Halo or Call of duty? They look way better than lego...
EmeraldGenerations	Reaper buff is great for Reaper mains, but everyone else is going to be really salty about it
I_ROCK_U	Overwatch world cup viewer *BBBBBRRRRREEEEEAAAATTTTTHHHHHEEEEESSSSS*
Dan Smith	We need a Omnic Talon tank.
Jack Ringel	This viewer sounds amazing! Any chance it'll ever be implemented into OWL?
Awley	I thought they were adding role select when they said they were adding a feature... I have been bamboozled.
Christian Drake	Can we just bring mercy back to pre-invulnerability mass Rez. I mean she would still be awful but they could bring valk down to like a four second flight on a 20 second CD.
EnderEmerald gaming	No nerf symettra shes op
I don't care, I'm playing widow	Did i just hear that !?  Buff ? For mercy !?  üò±üò±üò±üòÇ
Zachary Perkins	When this comes to the base game, it will be one of the best things ever added the game. New maps and heroes are awesome, but you can imagine the game without them. Other features are just so good you can't imagine the game without them. Arcade, lfg,  competitive s2. This will be one of them. Obviously not everyone would use it, but as an editor, this is amazing. I can go on and on. This is freaking awesome
Xurat0	0:11 "We're talking about Blizzcon-" I'm out.
Tiny Grass	*I can hear the forum cries already*
JSKyOto	I know this is kinda minor but am I the only one that kinda wants all the cinematics in their own menu like in Diablo??
Gaius Trollius	We need a nerf on brigitte's shield‚Ä¶and preferably also a removal of her self-healing ability.
snowykitten	A buff for mercy, wut
That gamer guy 101	My boi hog getting the buffs he deserves
Apollumix	Hoping for the best that mercy will be revived.
J GAMES 2004	I feel like genji needs a buff on his shurikans no?
randomguy26	dont care bout esports , dont care about replays , just give me maps , lore . new heroes that are not cancer , like everything you've added since anna
ITS YA BOI BESTEST BOY ON YOUTUBE	JEFF
The Drunkard Cat	New Hero... camera man
Gravity Angel	Mercy buff to Valkyrie? Can‚Äôt wait to see what it is
Morbinion	Talking about demos like it's a technological breakthrough. More maps? Remove maps! Scrap the entire 2CP mode with accompanying maps, remove head hitboxes for Widow and Hanzo, greatly reduce loss of control abilities and fix character ability bugs and inconsistencies. That's a start.
BawbTehBildhar	Mercy buff? IS THIS THE SAME OVERWATCH?!?
Hunter_G4E aggad	New hero New map New animated short IS ALL I NEED!!!
Savio Silveira	Yay! Symmetra is getting a buff! I hope it's more hp or improved primary fire
Marcos Echaz√∫ Diez	They should allow some streamers to comment the matches Live that would probably help grow the game viewers
neos faxim	BUFF MERCY!!!
Awesomebarth	Hi guys I'm Overwatch from the Jeff Team and here are some developer updates.  1. PC gets early access to all content always 2. We're nerfing every character besides Brigette 3. More social features that don't do anything to the game.
Silent Taked0wn	Took em only 2 years
sp00kio b00kio	Ok cool. But when do we get actual gameplay updates
Andres Contreras	Did he used the words buff and mercy on the same centence?
Killua Zoldyck	Okay so we got Buffs to Hog and Reaper and Mercy but     Still we are not gonna fix ranked? Aight well R.I.P. Overwatch 2016-2018
Angela Ziegler	YASSSS MERCY IS GETTING A BUUUFFFF
Gluttony Biscuits	BRING. BACK. MY. SOUL. ORBS. please. :'(  But make them vary depending on the health that the hero has on full HP
Caillen 2000	Blizzard:  üòíü§ö: Fix broken heroes like Brig  üòèüëâ: Add a replay feature
Ryu-Ichimonji	This is awesome I hope the replay system gets to overwatch as soon as possible, god knows how many montage editing ideas this gave me
Matthew	Dying game.
Hideki _an	Reaper buff *WOKE*
Patricio Fern√°ndez	Well this sux, but at the same time is good news to know that they only care about the competitive side of the game. So is a good thing to not spect somthing good at Blizzcon, just some updates news and offcourse a new Hero and Cinematic. So for people that only play in a competitive way, this knowing this, is awesome. But for people that want more content, lore, history, modes and new ways to enjoy the game, its sux.
ForeverDegenerate	@PlayOverwatch  Thank you Daddy Jeff!  I thought I was imagining things when it felt like Reaper had gotten weaker after the Crit Detection Modification!  Which boggles my mind because that SHOULD have been a straight out buff to Reaper.  Tell me, what did the Crit Detection Modification break with Reaper?
The PinSir	Rip Jeff‚Äôs beard
joseph reis	Ok I hope I can start watching my own replays really soon bc I‚Äôm really ezcited
SuMadre ii	Literally dissapointed.
Delta Fawk2	that's amazing, this will be awesome!
kpopchop	Mercy...buff??? Thought I'd never hear the day! At last!! Well it's a start, I don't even play Mercy anymore and I'm excited for this. When are you gunna delete Brig Jeff?
Kbone Fiftyseven	Buff gengu
YouFoundMicheal	MERCY IS GETTING BUFFED HOORAY!
O.J. Joseph	Did he say *MERCY IS GETTING BUFFED* ? Nah you must be jokin
ZL Ling	Hi tech stuff, guys!
Pharaoh Horus	Ignore the roadhog flankers. They just want to flank and kill the whole team by themself even though he is a tank. Its bad enough it takes a lot of dmg to kill him because of his 50% less dmg while drinking his kool-aid. He isnt bad just not op.
Conner Elliott	Where is role queue?
p3ppermints	Hey pharag needs a nerf on console ONLY console
Jokerday	Here's the thing: there's a large group of OW players that actually couldn't care less about the whole e-sport/OWL stuff, including myself. I'm playing this game regularly for longer than any game ever by now starting when it released... but I honestly kinda feel like it's heading a wrong direction. What attracted so many players back then was the lore, the characters, the shorts, the whole charm of the game (of course including the gameplay) but NOT the e-sport scene. Where has all that gone? I really hope for a larger expansion to be announced soon. You know, with multiple new heroes, maps, skins, intros/emotes (why are there so few??) and some animated shorts that will finally push the story forward.
Jalal Basri	what are u doing man, save the game !
Rafael Nunes	Too late Jeff. Really good idea but the game is already dying.
Seb F	Pls no reaper buff, please please no
Lucky	Come on man , we want a new map thats not 2cp

Dylan JL	Revert mercy already. Her rework is a failure. Having mercys ultimate ability resurrect on a 30 second cooldown is not fun and not balanced.  Rework her with changes to her ultimate. Like LOS or a cast time, no invulnerability. Give her a skill shot ability so she has more utility like ana
Jafarson The Wise	Do you know that there are people who doesn't care about watching someone play? game is boring after 2 weeks you know? after 2 years game is still the same. What are you going to do about this? Maybe you copy some more features from TF2? for example alternate weapons and deep character customization? Make separate character levels and add some equipment to unlock, passive and active skill swap. Just do something new...
Ventrae	I wonder what a programming achievment this overwatch viewer was. Milions of people watching at the same time? With all the observer feartures and more? Replay system? Everything ingame? Blizzard programmers must be close to world elite...
Brandon Hern√°ndez	Stop buff symmetra!!
Barasingha	You know what would be really nice?  MORE. LORE.
Alex Goodman	I really hope these mercy buffs don‚Äôt make her meta. Ana or zen or any of the other supports are so much more skillful and better for the game.
Game Addict	Why do all DPS mains hate mercy so much, she never deserved all the nerfs, it's literally just because of all the DPS complaining about GOOD mercy mains.
The Donny Life	Skip to 4:30 if you don‚Äôt have pc
doobie	Replay system is gonna be a thing, i just saved you 8 min :D
Matthew Sadlier	I know I speak for everyone when I say, we need a New York map.
DevilGearHill	Anything major ? More then just skins and a hero once ever half a year ? Maybe basic ability variations for existing characters ? Like what was introduced in the last Smash Bros ? No ? Okay... Too bad I can't get a refund anymore...

Quniverse	World cup viewer is about to get mad widow booty.
Nappa Carl	Mercy buff? Yes, yes that sounds nice.
lemonkat._. 13	Jesus Kaplan
Wade Bate	If the reply does become a thing, you‚Äôll have game proof of hackers and trolls as you can watch from their perspective! Plus the fact that you have video proof of players being toxic built in to the game should make getting rid of these players that much easier
Azazel	Blizzard stop buff characters and start nerf broken op heroes like Brigitte. Why noskill characters are strong?! Moira, Brigg,Junkrat should be removed!!!!!
Emergency Jergens	DAMMIT ENOUGH WITH ESPORT UPDATES
Bucket of Gondor	NERF BAGGET

Lourapa Gaming	I love the Blizzcon and thx you PAPA Jeff üòâ
TheRenegadeStarr	They want us to care about OW League so much. And I honestly don‚Äôt think most of the OW audience doesnt care. New maps, new game modes, hero‚Äôs, and shorts.
IDK 700	2:42 oh no Jeff...
Nick Mattingly	Jeff sprays plz
Tom 12345	This is unexpected....
Kylar Reger	Symetras turrets need degree don‚Äôt like how they can be flung across map and how much damage they do while she isn‚Äôt put into danger for them
victoria thomas	All changes that don't effect me. great
N1njaman3 !	He never denied us getting a new hero #hero29confirmed
The Excelllence	The world cup viewer sounds awesome, people will be able to do some really cool and creative things with it. With that being said, Please release something significant for Overwatch at Blizzcon. I have a theory that y'all have been stocking up on big ideas you needed a lot of time to finish and it will be announced at Blizzcon. At least I hope you will.
lasticot29	Oh my god!!! I love you so much üò≠üò≠üò≠

Fetus Niall	Why are they buffing mercy already :(
Matthew Tolocka	Console overwatch shafted again? 1:40 yep. Of course. 2/3rd (out of Xbox, PS4, PC) the community is always treated as second-class.  Love it how Overwatch treats the community. Every dislike on this video will represent another angry console player. Please let Overwatch hear us.
Fredster	No please. No mercy buffs.
Ultimarad	I must be dreaming, buffs for 4 of my ex-mains? No way!

C	Can let Mercy be absurdly OP for over a year but can't let her be underpowered for a couple of seasons lmao I guess the B.net forum Mercy mains pressured them enough.
Disgodly	Dislike for no actual balance changes or fixed social features.
sonfan	Esports >_> skips video.... Mercy Buff.... Valk......Buff..... >_>..........>_> Valk... Buff.... Sym Buff :D... Valkbuff.....>_>......  Valk is the most boring part of Mercy, sure please be good. Like Zen and Lucios Ults.

Alex Martin	Finally. Sym and Mercy mains like me get to breathe
Solar _	Jeff I love you
Breakpoint	nerf Hanzo and Widowmaker one shots, it isn't fun being shot 500 feet away from someone not in the battle hiding behind a box

GG Trollz	Holy f*ck finally news on a hog buff
Christin Eleven	I want a huge container Ship as a map! With 4 levels stacked! The two spawns are in the lowest part of the ship and the highest part! And the two objectives are on the second and third! It will be the first huge and stacked map! Come on guys! Please? üòÅ

NixUniverse	Why does he seem so nervous ?
Tonic Nest	Are the buffs in ptr?

Lemon Muffin	MERCY BUFFS!!!!! YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS  AND FIXING ROADHOGS HOOK  YEESSSSSSSSS
Maniac	Finally a demo system. Actually good to see this coming in, one of the few great things theyve done for Overwatch. Gonna be a huge use both for playing with teams (which I do) and coaching (which I also do). Words can't express how glad I am to see this finally coming in.
Matthew Terry	NERF DOOMFIST
Blas	2:41 You shouldn't have done that Jeff :D hahaha
John Patton	Careful with Mercy Jeff, one change too much and she‚Äôs back to being required in every match feeding bad players easy wins
Space	I'm so happy it's always Jeff delivering the news. Feels nice to see his face every now and then. :3
Angelo Miguel Serrano	Ok... but who are you again??
Jami Penttila	Why does Jeff blink so much?
GIT GUD	Yh symmetry needs a buff she's so underpowered and mercy too
CT7567	I‚Äôm very excited for World Cup spectator.
Peng	Watch Mercy get nerfed again right after her buff.
Ever Trejo	I just hope that the Overwatch League uses the latest patch available next season
AmbientTunes	Dinoflask cmon now
Quentin TERMINN BARTHEL	I don't really understand, is the way to watch the Blizzcon on live only for PC players? Or not?
Jack Albers	Why buff sym?
BlazeNarutoShippuden	Please make Moira's Fade 5 seconds and buff her ult's healing/self-healing.
Xander Ex	Finally they are buffing reaper
Daniel Manzano	The Mercy nerfs aren't as much a buff as they are a revert to her previous state (almost), she's able to charge her ult as fast as before, and during Valk she heals 60 dmg per second, which is knda decent, but still, pretty meh, she'll still be considered a troll pick.
Ziltoid TheOmniscient	OVERWATCH MACHINIMAS :DDDDDD
Ian Wurster	Change the speed to 1.5 and you will be able to understand faster Kapp
Matthew C	Wait where's the IT'S JEFF FROM THE OVERWATCH TEAM?
Harbenger zz	Valk changes most likely healing in valk to be 60hps in valk they could give an insta rez instead of that to make it a more versitile ult like anas healing buff to her nano  instead of valk
Edgy-Chan	R-r-r-r-Reaper?....B-b-b-b-b-BUFF?!!......oh god....daddy Jeff thank you....my boi needs it
Hector Chevez	Mercy is getting love? WHAT!
richards4000	If it makes it to PTR it's going live.
magnificent mercy main	Mercy insta rez when ult? Rez 2 people? Blizzard tell us please...
Geo Dash Busboy	He kept emphasizing "no new MAP content." He also said he has amazing announcements for BlizzCon. I do agree tho with @SI Not Found that Shrek is the new hero announced at BlizzCon. Or maybe the BlizzCon skin released will be a wrecking ball skin where he uses a belly slam as a piledrive. Don't disappoint, Blizzard!
Asthetical	POG, now when will it say "Overwatch Performance Update?" k thx love this one.
Jeff Cook	Now if all these features come into OW, just like HOTS....  Imagine being able to look at all your games, spec anyone, analyze. Sorry, it's not magic. For those are younger and unaware, timedemos were available and commonly used and shared in the 1990's in *some* games, like Quake. They went away due to laziness and/or verbal abuse reasons - although back then, communities were far better off than they are today.  Honestly, it's a feature that should be in most competitive games, and I'm somewhat frustrated when it's not available. Overwatch Dev's : this is a big step in the right direction when it comes to spectating features.
Cyber Silver	So basically activsion is allowing you to use theater mode?
Gabe Van Haecke	Someone please count how many times he says "awesome"
BluNakeo	OMG MERCY GONNA BE FINALLY BUFF <3333 And Sym Hog and Reaper too SO HAPPY
Takticus	I used my money on Mercy skin that you nerfd. not interested i bought the game twice for PC and ps4 to play no to watch someone to play.I will do not spend even a cent on your games anymore. but I like to see how you trying. I wish good luck
Bud3 The Orange Fox	Wheres the my name is Jeff from the Overwatch team gone? FUMMING
Glenn	Jayne just got buffed!
DerPavianAdrian	Hey Jeff show us some bloopers already xD!!!
O-O o3o	REAPER DOES NOT NEED BUFFS!!!!!
Nordic Animation	The only interesting thing for me in this video is the Reaper and Roadhog buffs üòÅ
zone killer	Black shirt new hero
Austin Woodruff	The WoW devs should just copy this format.
Lucas Mills	Just press pause randomly through the video, do it for the memes
michael shih	Finally woot, watch stream and watch in game

Mr. Mister	That replay feature sounds awesome
DrStrangeMcDuck	Hook 1.0 is coming back run
Steel Dragon	sadly no junkrat buffs Press F to pay respects to all the sad JR mains

Elite-Hunter_17	My eyebrows went up when I heard "Mercy buff." Didn't know that was still possible.
JenovaDoll	I stopped playing Overwatch since Arabs took over European servers
FishNugget 501	No introduction, who is this?
Awsm2	Overwatch is slowly dying and with the addition of brig and events with nothing added to them is making the game die at a faster rate.
Andrew Petersell	Easily the most disappointing Jeff shirt.
Unity 181	OMG NOT A MERCY NERF!!!!!!!!!!
Crafty Chris	Jeff I‚Äôm not surprised console can‚Äôt use the extra stuff, there‚Äôs probably a reason even atm we can‚Äôt use the ptr would really appreciate it if it would be possible.  Thanks
Practical Sensei	Looks like we're finally getting something as awesome as the theater mode was on Halo 3 and reach.
TheAtomicBear	Ayyy i can put one of the pros gameplay on my screen and act like i'm super good for once, but this time... it's believable.
Carlos Santos	Just delete mercy let the retards fall
cruizer54	Man these people really want to push esports into our asses. Its getting disgusting.
Woofly Wolfy	FIX BRIGITTE
Khaled Hossam	Who is this guy? He should introduce himself.
CCore	So this is what they've been spending a lot of their time on. A world cup viewer....Yay....
juanjo12x	Oh my god, I wanted this feature since OWL began!!
Reyla Wolfang	I think we need another Shimada sibling (sister) or a Talon tank
Cbullet51	Another Symmetra Buff...90 hours with Symmetra next season ü§ôüèæ
Aymen Fay√ßal	LoL kids in comments not knowing some games had this feature centuries ago .....
luuk van der lee	MERCY AND SYMMETRA YASSSSS
Pomps Jr	I think before any heroes get bugged or nerfed... Competitive needs a reboot üòÇ
dzunepwnsipod	They needed a whole 8 minutes to say  "we're adding a spectator cam, and a few buffs"?
Rare Gaming	MERCY NEEDS TO REVIVE FASTER...... üëå
Shaya	What happened to the Rein/Brigitte 180 bug fix you were going to put out? It still happens to me every single game :(
SS BAJA	‚ÄúWe are not announcing a new map at BlizzCon.‚Äù So, a new hero then, or just releasing a new map before or after BlizzCon without an announcement?
The Sword Art Online Dickriding Association	FINALLY!  Montage time.
Victor Loria Chavarria	NERF BASTION!! :v
Dyn Awesome	Hero confirmed lol
Everton Peterson	Give us Space Marine Reinhardt or soldier 76 skin for Blizzcon Pls
Syrian Warrior	They about the game and its problem kapp ...i love that
RedTimeGod 7	Please, please, please, give us something Canadian. Doesn't have to be now, doesn't have to be soon, but please just think about it
„Ç¢„Çπ„Éà„É´„Éï„Ç©Astolfo	Can we just get cross play on OW?
Ryromancer	when blizzcon again?
Johnny Stash	You Fools...       This isnt Even Overwatch's Final Form yet! >=)
tiggle5485	Can Roadhog finally pull targets through breakable railings?!?!?
John Ginzo	The replay mode was in halo 3. Can't be that hard to make
Shaboingedy	Sym definitely does not need buffs, she's already stupidly annoying to play against as it is
Gonzalo Arriagada	Thanks papa Jeff <3 !
Jere Jutila	Not even a word about Reinhardt...
Charlierashi	I really wish it was available on console, oh well still sounds really cool.
Chump kins	Please don't buff reaper
Jume	FINALLY BLIZZ‚ù§
That 1 deafault Boi	Yaaay
DEelEM TV	Please Genji needs a buff especially in this stun meta, all I would suggest is that single shuriken dmg would go to 30, and for deflect to not revert to the original hit box but for it to be slightly bigger. Please papa Jeff I want fun :)
Aquamarine	I wonder when this esports slowdown/speedup shenanagins can come to custom games for smaller teams, this would be absolutely amazing for teams during scrims, matches, etc.
Todts	Who is this guy? What's his name? What team is he from?
Star Power*	Before watching the video: i guarantee they won't bring up mercy and how she's the worst support right now.    After: lololololol they buffed spectator mode
Guilherme Viana	I came here hoping for some tip about a new hero, but ok, I'm patient
UltraRanger	Reaper and Mercy buff!!! monkaS
Magenius_MH	why not bastion Jeff? when the bastion buff?üòî
Genji Shimada	I Need Healing
WolfH128	Drink every time Jeff says: Overwatch World Cup
Overwatch Pro Spotlight	:OO
Springfart	so excited about the spectator client
Brandocks	it's about time guys
Medell	Probaly they are gonna buff mercy to make little light on nerf records for mercy. So people can't claim: mercy have non stop nerf not even buff.
Drazan	FINALLY A DECENT VIEW OPTION SO I CAN WATCH THE GAMES THE WAY I WANT!

Scruffy Gamer	FINALLY MERCY BUFFS
TheTacoGod23	It's a coin toss
Vera Tsankova	Are going to come to Bulgaria
SOG Big Boss	Mercy BUFF !!! better make her good again
Nosttromo	"we're having a new feature coming" "great, is it a gameplay element? a new game option? changes in competitive?" "it's the overwatch cup viewer" YAYYY that's perfect, exactly what needs to be focused, why fix a game when you can extract money with cups leagues and etc
The Tech Times	Ow world cup trailer
FlimsyRanger	Jayne, I can‚Äôt see you, but I know you need to calm down right now :p
Killershark  .	Can you let beta testers try the feature early for a buy in fee? you'd get so much more funding for it, and it would help people improve
Panic OW	Sym buff?!?!

Eternal Scout	4:56
EmeraldStorm	Can we have more animated shorts? Pls? pls?
minisig :3	HI OVERWATCH GOD  JEFF
the salty spittoon	STILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGING HOW THEY RUINED MERCY. This is actually getting ridiculous, admit you gutted her with the rework and fix your mistakes.
xtv62	I don't care at all about esport but those features are cool
illuvatar the chosen	Its always been  for the pc ... No offense but Overwatch team should focus a bit on console.cause the game is not fun anymore and that comes from a huge fan  NOT a hater
Scott Campbell	Sorry Jeff, I need ma twitch chat bois
Dubiety	I like that this DU is about watching competitive play in a fun way rather than making competitive play to be fun to actually play.  Who honestly cares about this?  Give us what we actually want rather than giving us what you think we want.
CraX	Buff to Mercy WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT ?
Ivan	10 seconds in the video, start talking about E-Sport trash. Stopped instantly and disliked. What a joke, really.
AwesomeName7	>Mercy is OP and basically dwarfs all other healers >Buff Mercy mfw
I Am Who I Am	The replay feature reminds me of the one from Warcraft lll.
Chris Anderson	I'm happy with the planned buffs, not ecstatic but happy. I'm hoping blizzard plan to introduce some new content for the game as a whole, hopefully some more additions to the lore soon.
abgar111	"Not all the ptr changes will go to live"  Great joke Jeff. I didn't know you were a comedian as well
Daniel Williams	Why are you only buffing like 4 hero‚Äôs at a time what happened to small buffs and nerfs here and there
josh betts	hi toby  hi will
QuickSandYT	OMG THANK YOU SOOO MUCH BLLLLIIIIZZZZZZAAAAAAAAARRRDDD UR THE BESTTTT CANT WAIT

Alejandro Chimalpopoca Dev√©ze	buff lucio  more speed
Fresh Waffles	YES! MERCY BUFF! Thank you!! Edit: Nevermind.
Dick Kickem	Great. Mercy buffs.   This will go down well.
Chelarch	JEFF GIVE US ROLE QUEUE
TheRobochicken5494	delete 4gitte
Jesse Sanchez	Wow this was disappointing
XaKeR	PC master race
justice m	Please new tank or support.
QU	So the all-access pass just got worse...
Jonathan Josue Hernandez Anaya	I love how people are just waiting to see one Mercy comment to start calling them ‚Äúbrain dead mercy one tricks‚Äù I mean, how retarded do you have to be to instantly default to that brain dead response?
Bren Kevinson Uy	Have a game mode were the goal is to destroy a certain tower from the opposing teams bases. First team to destroy their enemies tower wins.
Chaplin001	But wait... where's Jeff from the Overwatch Team?  Who is this guy? He didn't announce himself...
eclipse_d. midnight	WHAT? A MERCY BUFF?
Flame0326	Hope she heals 60 again durring ult.

KalKenobi83	yes mercy is getting a buff Finally
SnazzyMolly :D	WAIT DID I HEAR BUFF AND MERCY IN THE SAME SENTENCE??? AAAH FINALLY
yourtypacalzombie	PAPA JEFF FEED ME CAMERA SPEED
eylbba_ ami	Console players have to pay more for less features... Smhüòï
Kalyx triaD	Dedicating a minute and thirty seconds to what's actually coming in-game is a rather poetic symbol of exactly the dissonance between OW devs and the community.  The viewer sounds nice. Good for the streamers. The average OW gamer simply isn't booting up the game to stream events.
Clorox Bleach	C LUL N S L E
Icey	Skin transfer? ü§ó
Ruba	In the coming update, can you make a new Viewer, where one can play as a ghost player of their liking in the World Cup game?
Joe West	MERCY BUFFS INC.!!!!!
Killercrok 29	Make jet pack cat hero 28
Dwight K. Shrute Assistant To the Regional Manager	I have gotten a total of 5 base game legendaries in the Halloween loot boxes this event so far, and *Zero* event skins.. from all past years.. **sigh**
Bakugo Katsuki	I just can't not like this guy
Chris Again	As a console player I am curious about when we ,console players, will get any new feature. Will there at least be a hero announced? I mean I understand the reason for no map release, but that is one thing I was waiting for. The Overwatch team is hard at work and that's certain. I am just hoping that something special will come out of this for the console players who do not get to experience ptr, and have to wait longer for the actual updates and features. I know that the Overwatch team will deliver as they always do. I just hope it doesn't take too long.
David DuMond	This is actually really cool!
Xero the Fallen	Oh for the love of god make mercy at least fun to the slightest degree...
SonicVoltage	NO "Hey its Jeff from the overwatch team??" WUT
Laura McCloud	HALLELUJAH, PRAISE PAPA JEFF! MERCY IS FINALLY GETTING A BUFF!
Incipient	Please revert my mom
Demon Hunter	Roadhog finally getting changes. nice.. now nerf the ridiculously OP doomfist and some might comeback to OW
Kev Dog	The ability to watch games previous games is not new. Halo 3 had that capability and that game is pretty old. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not already available for overwatch
Wayne Perkins	Still nothing on rein.      *WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US JEFF*
smartAL912	What else could Reaper possibly need??? No Sombra bug fixes, *BET!*
hitokiri	RIP soldier 76
Lance Denis	Can you start working on things people actually want?
Eightslinky	Next map will probably be 2cp, DansGame
Musa Alam	FIX THE LAG
TheSwordOfBathelion	Freedo is pumped
Edwin	olaf is thw new hero
w00tyd00d	In b4 Stylosa blows up
Lorenzo	Would anyone like something like a new server where every character is at their most op form? Like launch McCree, 20 damage Soldier, Triple Tank Ana, 4 rez Valkyrie Mercy, etc. I‚Äôd absolutely adore to have that and I think the pro meta would be more diverse and interesting than the current game.
ScrewMyOpinions	BALANCE THE GAME.
Stalast	i love jeff
Bubztte !	Finally SYMMETRA AND MERCY BUFFS. thanks Jeff.
Gunner man 9980	So soon, you will be adding theatre mode from cod? Is that what your getting at
william anderson	I hear roadhog and mercy buff.im happy
Tobi Sonola	The Your Overwatch channel will love this.
A kleiman22	LOOK AT HIS HAND THO
CephasRed VS.	Hey Jeff/Overwatch Dev Team, do you have any plans in the future with any works on Reinhardt?  The reason I ask is because I'm a Reinhardt main and after playing as him for 2 years, i've noticed that his defense is getting weaker and weaker with each new hero coming in. Basically, his armor doesnt seem as strong as before: For example, Bastion can take him down in 1-2 seconds, and Moira's overpowered depletion balls and beam take him down in no time flat.   In short, could Rein get an armor upgrade and have his shield block all attacks, physical and energy based, with of course keeping the shield health bar as is? Offensively, he's great, but defensively, as of right now, he doesn't feel like a tank at all, just an overgrown, soft, easy target.
Oliver Adam	New spectator mode is absolutely huge. Having that for OWL and ladder even. Coaches and analysts are going to love this. So much we'll be able to learn
Steven909	Overwatch 2 confirmed.
Sam Darcy	What about mercy is she still dead ?
LordSkeleton17	To be honest, I am expecting some sort of a flametrower hero. They introduced/worked on burning mechanics for Torb, so I have a feeling they will use it somewhere else as well and maybe even build a hero around it.
Cloudberry	So no news yet on when the DH-Sombraskin will be available to people without VT?
Khushal Satish	DAD
Brandon Acosta	Sym needs a buff? I'm just shy of a 90% win rate in my plat alt account.  That is plat though so idk
Legionairre	Thank you for acknowledging Mercy
John Smith	Did he say Mercy and buff in the same sentence? What sorcery is this?

ArchfiendGod	SYMM AND MERCY BUFFS!!!!!
GNE Show	Nerf bastion
DrJayNation	*"MERCY"* and *"BUFF"* in the same sentence? Nah, I call BS.
Sora	Daddy Jeff has blessed us, thank the lord
Mr Numerobis	Omfg this ow world cup feature is insane
Thib L. Est.	Um...Symmetra? Buffed? This doesn't sounds right. I hope someday Bastion will get nerfed because seeing my rein shield melt like ice in the sunshine because of a Bastion 3km away isn't fun by any means nor is it balanced.
Alex Davenport	New hero confirmed
Sans The Time Lord	Role Que pls, maybe a Brigette rework and some Sombra nerfs as well pls thankyou. Loving the new features so far.
dogzillal	i talked about how awesome the tech like the world cup viewer would be for streaming  years ago, it's nice to finally see technology get there
Paul Mata	Can you guys nerf Brigitte out of existence?

Phunny Yo	Amazing to get matchreplay to see if my yelling at bad tanks actually is legit. Hopefully add a scoreboard, atleast for replay.
SteveSupreme	6:21...      I am uninstalling.

Travis Thomas	All hail the Overwatch team (the buffs most have wanted)       Thanks for listening to the community
Were berius	Where‚Äôs my Illidari Genji Papa Jeff?
Skyra Jinn	MERCY BUFFS YES MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE  GOD BLESS JEFF
Babman	Remove brigde women
Ihsan Ali	Still no Nerfs for Brigitte, My idea to nerf her is: Reduce the self healing from 16 to 12 Per second, Lower damage to 25 on shield bash (chance of Tracer survive) and Primary to 30 Damage. GM level having a very hard time going against her.
Colora	Why is there never any nerds to characters that need it? The last nerf I can recall is Brigs shield...I can‚Äôt think of any others before that
Courtney Morgan	Sym doesn't need buffed -_-
Fares H'k	i khow'it Before he says it  the new Overwatch World Cup Viewer
Daniel Rojas	He didn't say a new hero was gonna appear  O-o
l„ÄànighT¬¨972	But who are you tho ? Is this Jeff from the Overwatch team ?
Kalina uwu	I want Mercys healing back!!!
kyy	THIS JUST HELPED THE EDITORS AND CONTENT CREATORS IMMENSELY THANK YOU JEFF
Steve Vo	U have a mistake in description. U said expect Mercy buff, I think u meant nerf.
Please don't waste food!	D.Mon new hero aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
StuPid	Future Overwatch? We getting a sequel? Overwatch 2?
Liz	ew mercy buff
thekoening	This is epic
Thomas Sencindiver	I'm very excited that the Overwatch viewer is coming, I'm just so sad it took so long. I really think the game has taken a big hit viewer wise because it wasn't a thing from the start. But hopefully this can bring back some viewers.
Female Marionette ‚Ñ¢	*DO NOT GIVE MERCY A BUFF.*
Ninja Man	Reaper Roadhog buff?? *A MERCY BUFF?* This has to be a papa jeff
That Funny Guy	I CANT WAIT FOR BLIZZCON!!!
Garnet Fire	I‚Äôm sorry but Mercy just get a new rework! Please!
Thelegend _35	JEFF IS JESUS
SoulTales	Mercy buff omg worth the wait
Sammie Jones	OH SNAP! That's exciting! can't wait to spectate!!!
karkat vantas	Hey Jeff, I have an idea. How about you give the console Community something that either the PC community can't have or can have later on? You made this game for Play Station as well Xbox and I feel like you guys are neglecting us. New systems are always released on PC, I understand that you guys can fix things easier on your own client. But I'm tired of having no benefits from having a console versus a PC. Please show interest and console as we are a big fan base as well, maybe not as big as PC but we still are a big majority of the community.
Ashkan	WELL SHEEEIIIT
shaNk	Can you fix doomfist when he randomly has invinciblity against CC during his slam? (ignoring sleep for instance)
Franky Magic	Interesting how he didn't mention a new Hero wasn't going to be announced.  Just no new map.  ;)
Dev C.	So glad to see Symmetra buffed :) She, along with Torb, are my mains. Now, I just want the amount of time when torb presses F to destroy his turret to be decreased
Ersen	YES! THE SPECTATOR 3000!
X Punishment	ABOUT TIME POOR GIRL FINALLY GETS A BUFF But most importantly ROADHOG BUFF BRING BACK THE ONE MAN APOCALYPSE!
Okay Okay	Dont care about the viewer, gimme the close up face cam of boombox cus this mans a visual
Cuttle	"Mercy buff" I can already hear the mercy one tricks stampeding back to overwatch Pepehands
BlueCash	REPLAY SYSTEM CONFIRMED!?!?!?
NERD4GAMING	Cross platforming is hopefully happening eventually
Elly D	MERCY BUFF? JEFF U MF ANGEL. though reaper, sym, and hog dont need a buff, you are amazing.
Missouri 1105	Wow üòç
Nico Winter	Lol people still play this game
LAWLr :D	yaaaa halo forge
Dean Gardner	Mercy buffs revealed: Valkyrie now revived 10 people at once while a nuke gets set off killing all the enemy team  Jeff goodman: the reason we have decided to make these changes is because all the mercy mains threatened my family, also we believe that reviving a dead player in a fps game is a balanced mechanic and should be in games such as csgo, this has been the overwatch team :) have fun
Kenneth Sim	OW worldcup and money it's now what Jeff cares about now,  not worrying player base had been down for current OW game since BR taken over.
Alexander Becker	Sym buff yes!
MADJiC Studios	If you're NOT announcing a new skin, what ARE you announcing???
ckfeliz	Im not mad that im not getting a new map if i can get that awesome replay system
Kaleb Pius	Reaper and Roadhog buff spoilers: Both heroes are getting their ults made into abilities
Benjamin Perez	FINALLY!!! :3
trixirita	Omg the spectator feature sounds so cool!

Rookie	Finally they do something to fix Mercy
J Dooms	REPLAY-SYSTEM!!!!!!!!! you know STY is jumping up and down right now!
Gollwer	bring the beard back
Polorpenguin 123	What about fixes to a still broken Reinhardt?
wumbo master	I hope the ability to vote for skipping a map/mode is added üò≠
Joseph Kinsman	Clicked so fast, let down even faster.... Blizzcon better fix comp, the communities only been asking for that for what... 10 seasons......
Zia Bhatti	Can you just add more content please
Its yah boi Solaris	Fix the skill rating
Flower	The torb patch was the best patch. #NUTBUTTON
fordis2	Someone give me a TLDR
RedSpinDasher59 Dash	BUFF! BUFF! BUUUUFFFF! (Mah boi Reaper's getting buffed)
vasco carvalheira	Great another Esports feature! god dawn it Jeff talk with the devs and make them add something new.. I have played for over two years and I am just almost done.. I still play Quick Play but still I want a new thing.. Like a new Non-Event Add On..
Diischarged	N U T
Jeeps64	"That means this feature will only be available for our pc players." WOW that hurts
A Wild Mercy Main	Expect a buff for mercy....THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN FINALLYYYYYY
Georgia Carslaw	Yay up dates for Mercy and Rodhog üòäüòäüòä
Salty Weeby	Jeff I really don't care about any of this but mercy and I see that the OW team only cares about OWWC instead of anything else which is dumb in my opinion but that's another topic. I honestly just wanna know why won't you give us 1.0 mercy with cast time that's the best way to make her enjoyable instead of killing her and making the player base turn away from her because she's useless in every possible way out there so please actually  listen to the community voice about player's most beloved angel
Dynasty Games	Please don‚Äôt nerf symmetra, she‚Äôs annoying enough as it is
xavier	jeff looks better, he looks in better shape
Reg Teodoro	*Skips To **6:00*
jennifer	why does jeff make me feel 5
blitzer oo	oh it's this game okay...
AlphaMax	Why am I not getting any Halloween skins towards the end of the event? I only get dups now. But I am glad I got Moira skin though. And the epic skins.
Youtube Queen	Can you make it so the loot boxes for events only has event loot I keep getting legendary old skins RIP üò≠
DatBoiiJonta'	PepeHands console plebs
Indoman123	This video sums up Overwatch rn perfectly. Blizzard cares more about export and less the game. If the Devs start to care about regular Overwatch it'll last longer but if they focus more on the E sport it'll die
Brian Burnett	Blizzard calls them "developer updates".  I call them "pre-rendered Dinoflask videos".
therealsamtheman	"Mercy buff" *I GASP* "...to Valkyrie" *I'M ALREADY OVER IT*
Forty Fountain	New feature  Jeff: let's not make it available for console until it's been like 4 months
Purrcat	Mercy sym buffs thanks jeff
John Arch	Other than learning that we can watch the world cup which is boring considering I play the game to play at this video give me no information they have less content so much I‚Äôm not sure of those games gonna survive another year if they keep the same stuff they‚Äôve been doing
silver Axel	Decrease the Torte health Or decrease the damage . Please work on mercy
vdb	looks like jayne's got his plate full
HellGrimo	I don't care about watching your World Cup or your Overwatch Leage. Start focusing on your real players not just small group that promotes your game
Pile Of Cheese	World cup viewer is a precursor to a replay system?
Keegan mckinney	Can't wait üëçüëç
laciee	You can release a new animated short instead of a new map at BlizzCon :).
Acro	All this cool stuff but still only 3 avoid as teammate slots.
Mewthree X	Nice
Mediaright	Will this have broadcast feed presets AND caster/feed audio?
Luiz Felipe Porto	Buff the range of guardian angel
lorcan	2 new heroes possibly?
RinTrash	When will it be on ptr ?
Clovilah	Yeah Symmetra needs buffs like a BREASTPLATE NEEDS NIPPLES.
CSA	MAMA HONG INCOMING
Xiodazer	Entire community: "Nerf doomfist" "Nerf brigitte" Blizzard: "Here's a reaper buff :))))"
violetrayz1	Yes go mercy! Mercy mains forever!!
Nintendo Hacker	THANK YOU FOR THE MERCY BUFF JEFF! ^.^
Leslie Tehuitzil	Mercy buff?? Wait....a I living in a different world???
Wilkham	Bastion ? Anyone ? Playing this hero ?
William Umstattd	So now anyone can be an Overwatch commentator. That is so cool.
Bobpo2016	Who wtf is this, this person didn't say their name
Firlow	esportssss
Rock-Steady-Yeti	Make Guardian Angle Great Again.
Roon	PUT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE KINGS ROW IN CHARGE OF MAP DESIGN AGANE
Its Zinx	Mercy nerf was the best thing to happen. She is still a good support just not a must pick
Phoenix sniper	I am hoping that it will be 20 second valk. Or one instant rez
General Grievous	We want Torb wall climb
bradley cooper	Junkerqueen?üòâüòâüòâüòâ
FluxGO	Excited for this but also we won‚Äôt get the full experience because the games will be all GOATS comp :(((((((
Mart√≠n Monicako	I think Genji needs a little buff so less experienced players can play it better against brigitte, etc... And Tracer needs something cause shes not in the meta... Thanks Papa Jeff for this preview. I totally agree with you in the map opinion that you all haveüòä
MaxRoucaille	Can we hear the broadcast while we are watching the games?
Quizey	Sorry papa Jeff, but your baby Overwatch is dying..... it has been for the past few months. The community has seen that there is favoritism towards PC, that's fine, should of been a PC only game if it was gonna be that way. We the Console community are tired of being in the back, we can let the game die on console and we will.  It was fun Overwatch..
RadBrad5	üòÉ
sovium	stop using all the money on esports... we want new content not ow league
Pulcio	Reaper buff? Why don‚Äôt you remove him from the game instead?üòí
Oscar Pullin	can we get Jetpack cat?
George Smith	No genji buff?
1579 EtaR0X	not gonna delete brigitte > still not interrested in playing.
Kowai	Reaper doesn‚Äôt need buffs.
Bob sagget	Can‚Äôt wait for this technology to come to everyone so I can see exactly how bad my team mates were in unwinnable games
Daniel Maiochi	Enable the account transfer from console to pc then, you guys couldn‚Äôt care less for console players lately
J.mack	Honestly if u put Mercy hps back! I would be completely fine. As a Mercy main I feel that was completely unnecessary! But I‚Äôm glad you are working on her
Francois Mpi	What I think will be annouced at blizzcon :  Hey we're introducing a new hero ! He has only one ability with a 1 second cooldown which will stun, sleep, knock back, pin, trap, hack, boop and freeze you no matter in which situation you are.  *tHaNKs jEfF !*
J. Manuel Mar√≠n	gimme gimme gimme Keff Japlan
Reni Guillory	every time I see this notification I get scared
Overwatchdojo	If the replay system goes through, it will give a HUGE quality of life boost not only to watching pro games, but for coaching Overwatch teams as well. Currently we are dependent on a good spectator, which always means getting an extra person or two to just be there and watch the scrims. Awesome update, opting in the beta ASAP!
Owen West	Please nerf doomfist already ffs he is literally at the level of launch genji when it comes to his solo carry and his ability to completely wipe teams.   Edit: literal plat chat below have never faced a GM or even master doomfist before or they are doomfist mains themselves who can't admit there main is retarded and has more wipe potential then most ults in this game.
Neptune Ow	Mercy ult a little too good I think
A Rehtman	Just make a story driven paid dlc with a few new characters for like 40 dollars  The game is dying, just do what r6 does and save the game, it's a shame every friend I know just dropped overwatch, because there is almost nothing new, especially last 2 events
KnucklesXAkiza	Sadly I haven‚Äôt been on Overwatch üò¢
joemab123	Reaper doesn't need a buff.....does he?
Expert Games	stop buffing sym it isnt helping. she needs more than a rework she needs to return to the concepting phase.
Sylvia J	MERCY BUFF ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Dooper Blooper	Now we wait for the Unit lost video  Start the clock ‚Äòcause I wanna see how committed they are
Gamerhandsjr	Wow, i never thought my voodoo doll of Jeff had worked this hard...
TrickZee	I have been waiting for this. Now we need an owl one.
Kristy Watson	Yes Mercy gets BUFFED!!!!!!!!!
Scott K	This sounds amazing!! Would love to watch pro matches purely from the perspective of the support characters, and the idea of it being released for personal use is even better.
alili1294	Role queue @ Blizzcon!
BluFuryWolf	Mercy buff... MERCY BUFF!! BOI YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION!
Alexandre Galanth	POG FCKING CHAMP !!!
R. Batinic	I really don't care that much about Overwatch World Cup viewer...
Blaze Gaming	Is over watch a dead game? Because of fortnite and black ops 4
Draco Pug	When are these balance changes expected to hit the ptr?
Tom Janse	Jeff, I know you're married and I'm sorry but you must marry me!
therealsalah	Let‚Äôs go UK!!! üá¨üáß     *BREXIT MEANS BREXIT*
mmseng2	Wow they made HLTV. Only 17 years after Valve.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great feature, I just find it amazing and somewhat humorous that this amazing technology was pioneered so long ago and yet never really seemed to catch on.
ky mck	I just want new hero's events and maps
OfficialSeanKent Gaming	MMMMEEEEERRRRCCCCYYYYYY!!!
Grenibba	Oh those are actual buffs ppl r asking for

Sloonz Lel	Is it me or does *WINSTON* is in need of a buff?
Ojee	Absolutely amazing feature, aspiring pros needed this so badly
Nevarenn [EGN]	Ermagherd plz just give us a replay tool for ourselves
Dodu Hunt	OWWCV Hype
Pootis	finally overwatch can call himself an esport game with this feature
TheMorphNix	No new map? TWO HEROES BOYS
Joseph Boswell	No map is fine with me. I'm looking forward to Hero 29.
nintendo yoshi	Another feature that is kept from console what else is new
Derpy Hooves	Reaper needs a buff so bad, I wonder what they're changing
Leon	Why mercy
SI Not Found	Shrek is the new hero guys
Azuridus	Is this the big social feature?
Voodoo Gunner	Jeff Kaplan we need you as a dev for world of warcraft!
SLOW	This is good. Not long before players can get replays of their own matches including all these views, rather than just pro matches üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
Stephen Ney	A Mercy... BUFF?  END OF DAYS
JLacay	That‚Äôs great and all but can we get more lore and new game modes like if there‚Äôs no changes then I don‚Äôt think the game will last another year
Ninoasker	Please don't touch anything else for Symmetra just buff her main gun that's all she needs please don't mess up thank ily papa Jeff
Jontman42	I can finally only spectate the Tracer players
NTK GAMING	Yessss mercy is getting fixed
Iguana_Exorcist	Does anyone else feel that Blizz is too focused on the Overwatch League and World cup and not so much on developing and expanding the game and lore? They haven't progressed the story in the Animated Shorts since the Infiltrated short (There was the Zarya/Sombra comic but that only really provided depth and background for Zarya). We've only had exposition and the gap between the last short (D.Va) and the short before that (Rein) was over half a year. The production of heroes is 3-4 a year and if the game is to stay current, it needs more heroes to keep the game fresh and to prevent the meta from getting stale. Thats just my two cents tho and if you think otherwise try and change my mind and see things from your perspective.  TL;DR: Blizz are focused too much on the OW League and World Cup and not enough on the game and lore. Change my mind *cue meme*
Jiggly Puff	Oh yeah give me that news *Daddy Jeff*
Callaboose	I love you.
PennyChaos	[Moira thumbnail] Me: Jeff don't you dare... Jeff: [doesn't discuss Moira at all] Me: praise jeebus
Pika Zilla	Mercy... BUFF? :o
Alpha Crash X	This technology is incredible and must have been so hard to put together. Its gonna make the OWWC viewing experience amazing
Ronald Thompson	I feel like it's Christmas in October.  I can't WAIT for replays for all games.
The No Life Gamer	make roadhog great again
finalfan321	please make something so that you can play your favorite maps more
SushiMudkip	Press "F" for Console Players
Genjiguy11	Please add a hero that can place trampolines or something so the team could flank or get to a higher position.
œÖ–º–≤—èŒ±  ù—îŒ±–∏–∏—î	Finally, they will buff mercy!
Jam	Wow! This sounds great! In the past.... two years ago. When people were playing and really wanted this feature :(
Gabriel Kuiper	This is such a huge step for overwatch. Having the ability to view whoever and replay games is an amazing learning tool and great for coaches. I am beyond excited.
ShadowDarter	So nothing on updating Bastion....
Naomi Shimada456	Cool
ichibei	We just came out of a 8 months mercy domination, be careful of those buffs.
Dinning	Cant wait for the new mercy and roadhog nerfs they really need it too op
Billy Bob	Optimization?
Busterman64	The word "Buff" and "Mercy" are in the same sentence. Never thought I'd see the day.  Also, if Reaps is getting a buff, I hope it's to his Shadow Step(his teleport).
SeaSideGaming	I highly dislike Overwatch.
Dragon Actual	Can‚Äôt wait to see an animated short that gives no advancement to the plot.
Serena Rae	tl;dr anyone?
BananaMan 76	Hey OW development team. This feature sounds really cool, but I'd rather you add role queue so I can PLAY OW instead of watch OW.
Pegasus Gaming	I had literally said that they need to make this exact feature yesterday when I was watching owl highlighd
Aaron Greenberg	Wait so is it coming to console or nah?
Nickii Sims	did somebody say MERCY BUFF?????? gimme.
Ranma	More mercy changes lmao. No character has been changed as much as her. They just can figure her out lmao.
Vasp	When brig removal?????
Renamon	so we will finally get that replay feature every coach is screaming for

Jose_Qndres Xd	Stop buffing symetra, shes already op dont make her worst

Coolsniperxx	So the beta test is only PC but the full version is coming to all or just pc
Albus Dumbledore	BRIGITTE

Homie Goldfish	Revive mercy daddy Jeff
Drunk Giraffe666	R.i.p overwatch. Dug it's own grave deconfirming a new map. Lazy year 3 events
GameSpryte	Everyone talking about the new spectator mode. I‚Äôm more freaking out about the fact for once Mercy is getting buffed. It‚Äôs been over a year.
Justus S.	Hi jeff :)
Sareth	Why would you want to watch Overwatch "eSports" when you can watch StarCraft 2, instead?
Nathan KRUBBLE	Fix Reinhardt reeeee
MSB	:LKGFJHIDSHDRLKDRE P:ULIOREKTJHN GE$R"T?O>L{:YGI<KNE$RWTGIOLK>"{<$ I have no words
Andres Morales	I thought you guys fixed the loot box system? I haven't gotten a legendary Halloween skins since the ones I bought from the credits
Bart	This is what overwatch needed  Watching games was such a clusterfuck
Dubby Dolphin	Waiting for xQc to review this
Simon Hirsch	Boi-ra
Y0shu	Yay another crappy esports update.
OTNOVSKY	all I got from halloween loot boxes are sprays
ThatGuyInTheCorner	Where is the nerfs to Mei?
Koray 03	MERCY IS COMING BACK
Manuel Galoyan	Pls new hero torbj√∂rns sister  xxD
ThelastGinyu	Finally fixing my ex favorite character that you ruined? Symmetra. I hope you truly do fix her. I barley play overwatch ever since her update. Ruined the game for me messing with my favorite character. I would always look foward to maps with big choke points because I could make her shine but now she's useless.
Dehydrated Mango	Daddy
Alexander Garcia	Finally a mercy "buff". Lets see what is it. I expect a nerf xD
Pine Cone	Mercy buffs kappa
grievous444	Any chance for next blizzcon, we can have different individual virtual tickets for the con? Since I don't think their are a lot of people interested in every game Blizzard makes. For me personally I only care for Overwatch. the reason I never buy the virtual ticket, since it's to expensive to get info for one game
Symcathetico	*_When will the patch be available? I want to test the buffs in the PTR, but i can't join it_*
HordeBrony furness	Praise Jeff
Kaneki	Dafuq nerf reaper
Death Rebirth	dear Jeff, your love of overwatch is commendable, please fix world of warcraft for them
blacksmithing idiot	Jeff I love overwatch I really do and I don't think that overwatch is as broken as people day but might I suggest fixing the characters people are complaining about I know I don't know everything about balancing a hero but I do think we could put a bit more effort into it and less into overwatch leauge and so on which I absolutely love by the way
Andy Shelton	This is amazing!
Ez0rus	Sounds like theatre mode that Halo 3 had 10 years ago
ThaMango	More World Cup    end me
Jacob Aguilar	MERCY BUFF YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY. IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE
Dragon Odin Lord	All the features are based on the cam in fortnite me nani
AdR929	I'm mainly glad that consoles received a little attention and love. If the feature goes through, it's a step up for us to have much more added later...don't forget your console demographic blizzard, please
Mr.Z	>Mercy Buffs  pleasegodno.avi
Iksuda Qataya	This is insane, I love this so much, bring this to OWL next season.
The Black Naruto	YES BUFF REPEAR MOREEEEEE
xHS	How much will it cost for observing?
Hekaro	Next: Pick ems
jack	MERCY BUFFS MERCY BUFFS MERCY BUFFS OMG
GG !	Yes daddy Jeff.
Sapphire Falls;	MERCY‚ÄôS GETTING A BUFF IM IN PHYSICAL TEARS
D. Alon	When papa Jeff thinks we like watching overwatch more than actually playing it..........
cgdct	Oh god buffing Mercy, please don't make her stupidly OP again. I was just starting to have fun playing support and I can't handle another moth meta
Ablivus	OMFG NOW I CAN STUDY EVERY SINGLE WIDOW IN WC AND HOPEFULLY OWL. DID SOMEONE RAISE YOUR PAYMENT JEFF? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.. YOU CAN KEEP DOOM IN THE GAME IF YOU GIVE ME THAT
Claudio	I thought i would never hear Jeff say "bluffs for mercy"... What happened ? They finally understood how to balance the game ?
Kianna Wilson	Finally a mercy buff..... but reaper? I‚Äôm scared
¬∑ Buki ¬∑	Take a shot every time he says "Overwatch World Cup Viewer"
darkarch757	"Can you imagine" ye. Weve been doing that since doom matches
CorrellLeo	They're buffing mercy? ITS THE END!
DwightLink	No new map... Story lore has been extremely slow... No new event modes... I get that it's hard work, but us all as fans are disappointed and dissatisfied. We are tired of the constant world cup and OWL stuff. Those things wouldn't be around if us fans didn't help hype this game up so much. No matter what, every game grows because of the fans. The fans are everything. And most people, including myself, would much much, MUCH more enjoy playing the game instead of watching it. Yes, it's interesting to watch, but we want to play it. Roadhog has been dead for ages. And it's finally coming time where he's getting buffs, and hopefully, legitimate buffs. Sorry to say, but saying there isn't a map makes blizzcon seem to be very underwhelming. One hero. One short. What else? Just social things and OWL/world cup stuff? We want in-game, playable, content.   I'm highly disappointed. But this is just my opinion
Landon 247	Do you think it would be OP if while you were being healed by mercy getting hit with a one shot from a Hanzo or widow headshot, a tire, a Doomfist punch, or anything that would kill you in one hit it left the person being healed with exactly one health instead of dying?
Cibix59	Yes ! Thx jeff
Sloan Rogers	The fact we arent getting the social feature until early 2019 and we arent getting a new map kinda scares me but leads me to believe that there is something massive coming.
iamLoneArmada	welp, im buying the ticket now. i definitely want to watch the World Cup in perspectives of my choosing!!
Rikunihon	A-Mei-Zing
Billy Parker	Mercy Buffs. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
brent matchim	Will there be a competitive map pool ?
Floof	was not expecting this but its cool ig
Stephen Busler	As an amateur observer still getting their feet wet, this spectator idea makes me so happy! Plus Roadhog buffs, now I can feel a bit more useful as an offtank!
Spencer Steele	first 75% of the video blah blah blah OWWC last minute "oh yeah about actual game balancing"...
blazer698	Mercy getting a buff??? Is Jeff on cocaine!?!?!?
ViperVenom811	Okay so how come you never give ANY testing ability to console?
Cthulhu The Great One	GOD HAS SPOKEN
Hey It'sme	If we don‚Äôt get a new hero/lore I‚Äôm actually going to fortnite full time
Loupe	hype
CodClover565	WAIT WAIT mercy getting a buff??? JEFF HAS SPOKEN GO CRAZY

The Loon	Why Sym and Mercy? Pepehands
Juho Saarenp√§√§	Reaper buffs? PogChamp
kipzonderkop1994	Considering how they singled out that there will be no map announcement, character announcement confirmed
The Sandity	REWORK MERCY ALREADY.  2.0 is garbage
Alapox	Interesting.....
owo OVERLOAD	PC woowwww you just did that to me
JackGamer 21	plz dont make mercy buff op i dont want to go thru a new nerfroll
Turtle Hermit WaspInatoR	Yay! ;)
Bryan Rohrbach	I‚Äôm just disappointed because we a probably just getting this World Cup thing and a new hero. I hope there‚Äôs more to blizzcon like a clan feature.
elysiums	can't wait for a new stun hero Kapp
MrFrost	"Beta testing the OWWC Viewer helps us work on the technology that will allow us to bring this functionality to all platforms and match type." This isn't new technology, Fortnite has had replays for months and has has Battle Royale for basically a year now. Replays are good and all, I am glad that you are adding the feature but you are making it sound like replays are a new concept.
ExoticFlame	NICE TO KNOW have a nice day JEFF
Xyanyde	Thank you for reviewing Mercy.  She needs help, and this is coming from a purist since early beta!
BernyMoon	Mercy buff. THANKS!
TheEccentricSandal	Just announce the movie at blizzcon pls k thx
Kouya Aotsuki	"Really exciting news today!" Oh?? "We're talking about blizzcon!" nvm then
Lucas H	0 interest in the world cup viewer. kinda disappointing dev update
Jeremy Leung	turns out the viewer will cost you $200 to access and you need to get a $100 overwatch pass to be able to buy the viewer
Logan Brown	How much does the mercy buff cost?
Daniel Mora	Papa Jeff spitting in 3:46 You are welcome
UltraTom	imo, what's the point of you uploading any patch to PTR, if you barely listen to the feedback we give online, on Twitter and stuff? Not to mention, the turn out rate for PTR is so abysmal that the required data you guys need is not there. I personally feel like the PTR is kind of pointless.
HUGOBOSS	Bastion buff or rework?
Falcondorf	Please make every one of Brigitte‚Äôs abilities a stun
Mike Wxlf	*Please port Overwatch to Nintendo Switch*
Dux Lusor	GOOD JOB PAPA JEFF! üî• Gj to you too team of development üëçüèª
TMNWG	Sooo are we talking "millions" of simultaneous ad hoc spectator connections here or what?
Tyler C	I was hardly paying attention until he said mercy‚Äôs ult was being buffed, I‚Äôm concerned
Mark med	FINIALy mercy myy main will be buffed yesss1. The power taken by Ferdinand III for the Holy Roman Empire's constitution was taken away and given back to the rulers of the German states.   2. The rulers of German states were able to independently decide their religious worship. [Catholic or Protestant or Calvanism]   3. Catholics and Protestants were seen as equal.   4. Calvinism was given legal recognition.   5. Protestantism was recognized as a religion.   6. All parties [Catholic, Protestant, and Calvanist] would now recognize the Peace of Augsburg of 1555
Hentai Hunter	We love you Jeff‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Ant Lhuede	Glad you put so much effort into watching Pro play rather than fixing the game experience for casual players. Good work guys!!

Akash Roy	Balance BRIG rather than bringing back the moth.
Acid	Me: I wonder what this developer update is abou‚Äî ohhhhh the roadhog changes.
Aatox	Mercy BUFF? FINALLY
CyberStorm571	I swear if mercy becomes meta again after this buff I'm not playing overwatch until its nerfed
Space Buns	Praise papa Jeff! Mercy gets a buff
Lutrisal__	OMFG!!! JEFF THE SAVIOUR OVER HERE "Expect buffs for Roadhog, Reaper, SYMMETRA AND MERCY!!!!" Almost certain it'll be a healing buff for Mercy from 50hps to 55hps. But for Symmetra? I'm not sure, I'm begging for a revert to Sym 2.0 but I highly doubt that'll happen.
Esoteric Ideology	Boy I do love >content

Anthony Sermania	Cool stuff. But when can we expect fixes for the colorblind settings so that I can actually use them to see my enemies for the first time in 2(ish?) years and also not have certain things be totally backwards, like Reinhardt's and Symmetra's barriers, Ana's antinade effects, some progress UIs, etc?
Jadett Zhu	GIVE US BACK THE MASS RESS

MLGvolcano 12	overwatch battle royale idea  so basically you would have all the maps in the game combined into one. You can choose any character from the game that you want, they would have the same health.. the only way you could get abilities or weapons/shields is from ground loot, also the ammo for the weapon it‚Äôs self would be with it  ex: junk rats gernade launcher would come with ammo called gernades or whatever creative name you could come up with.   ex: you would be able to pick up junkrats traps or bombs as an ability for a one time use; or reinhardts or bridget‚Äôs shield for a one time use

S_ Pollito	If we get replays then there should also be a feature to submit the gameplay of others if we report them to have clear evidence of throwing players.

Also she can also be a huge counter to main tanks and she can destroy every comp with 1 SINGLE ABILLITY. Oh what fun you guys should really add this because I have seen some positive feedback in lower ranks. I think her father should be rein but I‚Äôm not sure becuase torb sounds cool. Oh wait... oh no never mind it‚Äôs fine let‚Äôs carry on adding these heroes cause we really support you Jeff from the overwatch team.

JuniorGreed	I just had a meeting with chief. During the meeting, I recieved a notification about this post. I opened the post, and suddenly I didn't know how to feel. Chief saw my concerned face and asked me to show him what I was looking at. I showed him the post and trembly asked him "is... is this really it chief?" He looked at the post but his facial expression did not change. He did not say anything. He looked down at the floor then back up at me. My heart was pounding like it never had before. I could feel the rising sweat all over my stiff body. Finally, after a few excruciating moments that felt like eons, he took his chief commissioner hat off and quietly said this ain't it
