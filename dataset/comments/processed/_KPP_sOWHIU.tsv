LeBron is a choking bum that is supposedly the ‚Äú greatest player in the world ‚Äù and yet is hella passive on defense in order to pad some of his offensive stats and he fold under the pressure of overtime AND the LA spotlight not to mention he is turning his Laker teammate into simplified spot up shooter who play no defense like he did with the Cavs from 2015 18 This player wa NEVER made for the Western Conference and he will NEVER be the GOAT a far a I ‚Äô m concerned

Pragmatic Gaming	Spurs with an insane win tonight with a completely new offense Shooters like Forbes Mills Belineli Gay and Bertans keep the 3 ball efficient DeMar DeRozan is a BEAST at midrange like we all expect But the biggest factor in this game wa the big dog Lamarcus ALDRIDGE who wa due for a good night He fouled out 2 of LAs bigs and wa able to take advantage of the Lakers small ball lineup down the stretch Clutch rebound and enough long 2 to keep the Lakers on their toe Bryn Forbes the Sniper the sleeper the guy with the same last name of a magazine that talk about money all the fuckin time Just so happens to be MONEY when the game is on the line And he is FEARLESS because Pop ha given him the go ahead to shoot whenever the fuck he is open Something that Murray can not do So although his defense is lacking his effort and skill a a shooter play into his advantage and alot of you lakers fan probably never knew just how good he is a a shooter You will know soon enough He doesn t shoot airballs like Lonzo He shot 77 100 3 in front of Popovich when he first joined the Spurs To prove that he can shoot He now ha more minute until Walker and white return this season Rudy Gay Clutch AF We dont need to explain his ability He get bucket Now healthy on the spur he ha seen more wide open look than ever before His efficiency is going to be consistent The clutch 3 at the end that put SA behind by 1 the Hammer play with his friend DeRozan at the corner his consistency being able to shoot over tall defender at midrange The man is putting in WORK DeMar DeRozan 14 assist and 30 point A tough brotha no doubt able to take contact and make his free throw consistently He is a grade A competitor and so far he is showing his final form with San Antonio Especially with a 14 assist career high in what is just the 3RD GAME OF THE SEASON He even made a good amount of 3 pointer and looked comfortable doing so Welcome to the new look spur Our defense is not a good without Leonard and Green no shit But our offense ha WEAPONS and this is only going to improve San Antonio a of now ha the 2nd best Offense in the league after tonight s win Find out what happens next time on DRAGONBALL Z

Mariah Lin	Lebron James is one of the best player in NBA history Lets not forget his overall accomplishment But he is no longer in his prime He isn t the best anymore no disrespect Plus he wouldn t be able to dominate so easily now in the stacked Western conference The Lakers high paced style might also not be the best fit for his current condition

BigGucci 3hunna	LE CHOKE
C L	Warriors fan here honestly the lakers are really starting to look like they ‚Äô re coming together There ‚Äô s already a ton of chemistry in this newly established group and their potential seems to grow a I continue to watch them The problem is that they are playing warrior basketball and you can ‚Äô t beat the champ at their own game I feel like the older lakers formula earlier in Walton ‚Äô s career at the lakers when they had bigs running the floor and slowing the pace of the game down would work better against this trigger happy warrior team The warrior have a history of losing game while scoring under 100 point Just my two cent though Congrats to the lakers on their improvement a a team

Jesus Paid	Spurs enthusiast here First of all the offense look above average The ball move body are moving without the ball and we have solid shooter DeMar s offense is amazingly smooth and fun to watch But lastly I m tired of and not used to watching this carmelo defense Our defense is non existent at the moment I know it s early in the season but dang Spurs used to be all about defense Our best perimeter defender is Murray and he s out That leaf u with Cunningham being our best defender although Bryn Forbes showed some flash of excellent defense in this game Also Metu look like a solid defender but doesn t play much This ain t good Not sure how long this score more than the other team type of basketball can last this season for the Spurs Gay and DeRozan are going to have to find some way to not be like carmelo s and lebron s out there on defense and turn into a kawhi somehow They have the athleticism to be great defender They just need to be taught how to play smart individual defense It start with your stance and you have to be on your tippy toe If your heel are touching the ground while you re in your defensive stance YOU ARE WRONG That go for all you ball player out there not just the Spurs

Van Ignacio	My review of the game either both team play horrible defense thats why it a high scoring game no good clear defense and or the rule allow and favor the scoring and mo defense Also I saw that deRozan wa hitting from everywhere and either Lonzo Ball need to learn how to play better defense and or it impossible to stop DeRozan next I saw that Lebron is being given the 3 and mid range shot amd so Lebron you need to practice those and make them your bread and butter amd then team will play you defense up tight in the 3 line then thats when you drive to the hole get Ray Allen to train you amd some good mid range shooter and defense is what separate these close game the Spurs had a lot of uncontested 3 point shooting but then again are they unstoppable kudos to Ball Lebron Javale Kuzma and rest of Lakers they played great just focus on becoming a defense team since you got the offense part

Damian Lillard #0 D.A.M.E	Lakers center McGee is really improving on that glass and his play recognition Lebron is Lebron and Lonzo is out there on the defensive end but need to be better this team need a better free throw game and need a bad a it is but important a sharpshooter a guy you can rely on for the 3 Lonzo isn ‚Äô t there yet and Hart is in the bench Rondo is a streaky shooter Lebron need to be the inside machine with a short jumper like he ‚Äô s been idk but I say a shooter and better free throw game can make them deadly come playoff time
JasonÊ¨ßÈò≥Â≠êÈîã	Kobe over Lebron this is why Kobe will make both of that free throw and spur will dead but lebron and last year VS 76er he also have a chance to shoot three freethrow to tie the game but he miss one and then the whole thing is over also the 2011 NBA Finals and 2016 NBA final even though they win but it would be more deadly if he made both free throw and make a 5 point lead

King In My Own Mind	People will overlook how many Lakers are actually shooting well forget all the clutch shot LeBron hit to get them to OT and only focus on the lose Lakers issue are communication and defense all else is there Their on ball defense is very good but pick and transition it take familiarity and communication take time and coaching and film 0 3 suck but they didn t lose to Kings Suns Magic Rockets Blazers and Spurs all team they will see 3 more time patience I will say you want LeBron to close out and turn these closer game into Ws but the young guy are playing well Josh Hart once again is the most consistent player Lonzo for a much a people enjoy belittling him is playing well on both end and shooting well Kuz played great Svi and Zubac got minute and Like I ve been saying Zubac isn t a bum you play him and he doe his job protects the rim rebound and make his shot Luke need to get his head out of his as and play him and do the same with Wagner if Javale can t play real minute No reason Lakers should be getting out rebounded when they have guard and wing that can easily avg 7 8 rebound Way early I like what I see a a non fan Just need time and to tighten the rotation

x91~iNFINITi	Lol people don t realize that LeBron and his Cavs got off to a worst start last season way worst The fact that each of the 3 loss this season we re due to small mistake should show you that they aren t struggling a much a you want to believe they are Newly assembled team don t always win Sometimes it work and sometimes it need to be molded With that being said the Lakers will correct their mistake and get better They are already getting better Enjoy watching next game yall

Bradley Chou	Interesting to see Pop put Cunningham on Lebron for most of the game it wa only in OT did Gay defend LBJ The cavs lack defense in this year s line up so far only Rudy Gay ha the strength athleticism and height to defend LBJ LBJ had fun whenever slow footed Cunningham wa on him Also missed the old 2013 2014 Spurs offense in which they had motion or set play that involved a lot of off ball running When Kawhi wa healthy Spurs moved gradually towards iso ball Now with Demar and Aldridge I guess we ll see more of that 2014 Spurs had Diaw then Slow mo sort of filled that role now we don t really have anyone like those two on our team
Omar Pasha	James missed the in and out free throw Those were good aimed shot Lakers have to realize that good team will play great against them like it s a championship game Lakers know that they have a great team I believe that they are so overconfident of a victory that it s the reason for the loss Just stay down to earth and play hard

saurav suman	Lakers fan right now we need BLACK MAMBA p s i am a laker fan
DJ	LeBron s stat s look good but when I watch him in game he make some of the most questionable play i ve seen a nba star make aside from Westbrook ever There are time when he ha a fairly open in rythym shot at the top of the key but decides to pas it to a guarded not in rythym teammate in the corner who s forced to take a contested 3 The rythym he play with at time is clunky for a lack of a better word and seems to leave his teammate in bad position If you looked at the team on the floor a a well oiled machine LeBron is this oddity in the machine that sometimes run well but other time your like i payed a lot of money for you to make my machine run better but you re not doing what the brochure said you d do Your actually clogging my machine up and i may take you out because of how inconsistent of a component you are It s like he s thinking way too much instead of just playing in the flow to the best of his ability He doe that and the Laker s become more consistent and successful He doesn t do that and you can expect a lot more of this along with the drama that come with losing

sh09un1	0 3 for hater is ammunition 0 3 for casuals it a tragedy 0 3 for me is exciting Portland in Rip City Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs do you know what these game had in common besides that we lost The game wa kept close all the way to the end and we never got blown out For a team that wa formed a month ago that is all you can hope for October wa always going to be a free pas for me where I would only concentrate on the game and le on the result and although i have to admit i would want more passion and energy from Bron the team look solid If they are keeping up with the giant of the west with 50 chemistry imagine what it s like by all star weekend when Walton is done experimenting with line ups and everybody ha found their role until then we re all going to have to endure some more talk from the peanut gallery
Erick G Sanon	LeBron miss 2 clutch free throw kobe hit free throw with a torn Achilles

natisaver	man give him his prop tho for the ot shot anyway and srsly kcp shud come off the bench wa never good for the lakers since last year finally i get to see kuzma and lonzo start
Haven Moses	I been telling Laker nation these first 15 game going be rough Bron look like he coasting out there obviously choked at the end there but our young boy are balling lol never thought I be saying Bron need to HELP out our youngster more Lmao defensively and not turning the ball over Kuz and Zo playing with more confidence each day and can my boy Hart start over KCP lost as like give Svi his minute to wake him up or something
J Asuncion	No LeBron James fan better come to defense and deny it this time LeBron clearly choked on the 2 free throw and miss the game winner Its a shame I just can t believe the king like so many other occasion couldn t deliver Just show you why he like to defer taking the last shot and pas in closing moment instead Lakers fought hard for nothing to bitter ending LeBron is a choker in my book

Naero	Great game to watch even to my chagrin a a Lakers fan The upshot wa heartbreaking of course but the entire lead up wa heartening the Lakers found a rhythm offensively and LeBron played much more like the perennial BITW that we know a he reconditioned himself further Chemistry and LeBron s rustiness are my only concern at this time not whether or not this team will make the playoff the latter will take care of itself when the team eventually synergizes a it verily did in the second half of his first year in Miami and Cleveland second stint It just couldn t pay dividend tonight against a hot handed juggernaut in the Spurs but it will against lesser team the problem however is that those beatably lesser team will be few and far in between for the week to come Six out of our next eight opponent are all playoff caliber team so I ll need more than moral victory to be satisfied soon if we re nowhere near a 500 record after then I ll start to become apprehensive because the more uphill it is to make the playoff down the stretch the le wiggle room the 34 year old to be LeBron will have for much needed resting time
