brentkn smith	I really wish TYT would report on Global Warming more Unfortunately they don t They may report more than other mainstream news medium but when it come right down to it TYT is a political news station You are not going to get people out of a burning building by casually saying there is a fire in the building once or twice and then talking about last night s hockey score or what Donald Trump wa doing with an umbrella TYT instead focus on trivial thing design to distract the public from the danger of Global Warming If they would only give the subject of Global Warming a much air time a they do the political mumbo jumbo then maybe people would finally WAKE THE FUCK UP

Mark Meyers	Jimmy is falling for the word of corrupt body UN IPCC This is really global carbon govt Now put it into perspective 90 of greenhouse gas are water vapor CO2 is a fraction of the remaining amount I ve listened to climate pro ballpark the current CO2 contribution to warming at maybe 1 100th of a degree but guessing is the only option on earth today Recall historical weather data 0 8C change from 1880 to 2012 and the curve don t correspond with industrial output in that period That is too easily within a natural and mundane variability Back in 2000 Al Gore made some prediction that were wildly off People claim the oil company knew about warming in the 70 but how could they have had the science to be correct when nobody else doe Current climate modeling involves a small number of variable when monitoring limited ecosystem we don t have the global modeling science at this time If someone say they know they re lying The UN and the IPCC must be lying to know For me the real tragedy with this corrupted push for global carbon govt is to ignore all the skull and crossbones that we presently suffer from like fracking wastewater or hexavalent chromium or however oddly aeresolized aluminum or mercury lead sodium fluoride and many other thing that are killing u and giving u cancer and which are bad for all life they come in contact with We don t talk about these thing we talk about carbon Listen to Freeman Dyson or others there is a compilation of some video on the 1000frolly channel here to get counter point of view with some discussion on this topic I agree with the alleged 97 who agree in what I m saying Anthropogenic warming is real But perhaps saying so is also quite clever

MARS TV CHANNEL	HE DOESN T GET IT THAT THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE GLOBAL ELITE AGENDA TO PUSH GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS A TOTAL FORCE AND FRAUD IT WAS A FRAUD FROM THE START WHEN THEIR GURU AL GORE CAME TO PRESENT THE HOCKEY STICK GRAPH WHICH IS A COMPLETE FRAUD AND WHICH WAS PUT TOGETHER BY MICHAEL MANN AND THE SCANDALS THEY JUST PILED UP AND UP AND UP THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SCANDALS RELATING TO A SINGLE ISSUE THAN WITH AGW THE REAL GENOCIDE IS HAPPENING NOW IN YEMEN AND THE REALLY URGENT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE IGNORED WHILE PUSHING THIS FAKE BULLSHIT Besides that there are 17 time more people dying right now at this present time from cold okay then from heat AND according to NASA the planet ha become greener because of higher CO2 level This mean Greater Harvests translate two more yes much more food the world around for the people in poor country and well of course that s totally not done if you ask the elite they don t want poor people to get more developed and le hungry Furthermore A SIDE EFFECT OF A GREENER EARTH IS THAT THE PLANET STARTS COOLING To check for yourself just plant a few more tree in your garden and see how much it cool off in the summer The only place where it ha been getting hotter are the fcking metropolis concrete baby And air conditioning unit million of car engine running air conditioned office building vent and by the way that s where most thermometer to measure the surface temperature are placed near and on top and around those building in city that blow hot air outwards not in remote area where temperature is not affected by artificial heat source So the data is completely skewed for starter Thermometers they use to measure surface temperature which is then fed to their climate software to create climate model are disproportionately put in urban area that are naturally of course hotter because of the heat pollution while very few are placed in remote area like in the middle of a fcking ocean or even in the Arctic sea for instance another thing the South Pole ha been expanding it ice coverage now for almost a decade and significantly also according to NASA baby except for West Antarctica where it is melting but guess what There s a fcking volcano sitting under the ice cap there Same go for Greenland there are part of Greenland which sit on top of geothermal hot spot baby WRONG DATA IN BABY MEANS WRONG DATA OUT

Flavius Belisarius	Plato said 2500 year ago that to keep slave docile you should not feed them meat but bread and grain But yeah beleieve the Rockefeller foundation and others that pay for this stuff and keep eating grain The very same stuff that give you wheat belly that keep you full of illness causing candida and give you auto immune disease up the ying yang you stupid peasant
zackery zackery	Actually the climate change forecast model have been wrong in the past and these current forecast are largely driven by politics The fact that climate change is happening However there is a lack of conclusive scientific data to fully support the link between carbon output and climate change Add in the fact that climate change is highly politicized and pushed by globalists completely undermines the real research that need to be done to continue to monitor and study the cause behind climate change These forecast model which most insider in the research world will tell you are spiked with erroneous parameter are largely hyped in order to support the political movement and maintain research grant money The problem with fake news and fake science is that people aren t a stupid a you think
ADerpyReality	What is worse than climate change genocide
stapme	THIS JUST IN It s better than we thought There is no warming
donnie fiechtner	CO2 is not the problem All climate model that have been created have failed to accurately predict change in either direction Even the term global warming had to be tweaked to climate change just like the number in the climate model The planet ha the ability to self regulate which is why the model don t predict with enough accuracy to say one way or another Perfect for funneling ton of taxpayer money into part unknown
Vaughn Gainey	Wow we re fucked
Sil Mov	Very informative video
Jupiter rising	This guy is wrong It s way worse than they are letting on the level he is saying how bad it will get will be here within 3 to 6 year from NOW We are already at around 1 6c over base The true base line is the 1750s they move the goal post They have also not considered almost any self reinforcing feedback loop Effect form Methane x100 worse than Co2 The feedback loop are happening NOW not in 10 or 20 year We will have a blue ocean event next winter at the N pole When that happens it will spin out of control so fast it will make your head spin WAIT AND SEE If they stopped all carbon tomorrow within about 2 or 3 month the global temp would further jump around 3 to 5c possible 6 6c within that time line WE ARE ALL SCREWED The 6th mass extinction is well underway

Muscle Tribe of Excellence	I m fucking sick of hearing about this global government bullshit Who in the fuck do you know that support a one government planet Do you understand how much money the rich country with all the fucking power and money would lose It s the most fucking absurd talking point when it come to global warming And country like China India Iran and every other country are just going to bow down to the fucking west How fucking stupid do you have to be to think this is possible
Mike Mentor	Adapt 2030 is constantly putting out information saying that the earth is cooling that the sun is entering a solar minimum Who is right
Jim Walker	2ÀöC doe not account for increased warmth from REDUCTION of emission via particulate reflection of sunlight which offer limited protects by global dimming and methane release from thawing permafrost 4 5ÀöC is far more likely within the next 10 20 year Human extinction then becomes a possibility due to loss of habitat Methane emission alone would be five time greater than all human emission combined So really it already is game over
Wedge Wizard	We can argue all day about politics Meanwhile we aren t ready to do anything about climate change because money

Duncan Mckeowm	We can forget the 1 5c degree limit an increase to at least around 2 degree is already baked in due to about a 30 40 year delay in carbon dioxide effect reaching their maximum So those fume that came out of your car around 1980 are just now staging their star performance I hate the idea of climate engineering but clearing the CO2 out of the atmosphere seems the only way to go in spite of the law of unintended consequence

Scbrew All American	The sun Is 99 8 of the mass in our galaxy and emits the four most powerful force known in the universe CO2 is at 411 part per million and plant die at 150 part per million So naturally CO2 is going to end the world The IPCC is a UN puppet to enact Agenda 21 to gain socialist control of population Why did the IPCC falsify data set for warming to hid the mid evil warming and the mini ice age Why are they not telling the world that we are entering solar cycle 25 of a solar minimum Why is the arctic ice within the multidecadal average of ice and is growing Why ha the earth magnetic field declined by 25 over the past 15 year With a solar minimum more cosmic radiation hit the earth and cause increased cloud nucleation What effect doe that have on climate Why did Dr John Casey quit the IPCC Do you own research and stop listen to politically motivated propaganda Start thinking for yourself and read the science not the politics

fullgrunt	jimmy dore do some research on climate before spouting rubbish
IcarianX	Here in Ireland we need to completely change our agricultural industry and diet Currently it s mostly pasture cattle and sheep farming Not a bad a factory farming but the cattle in particular still produce a lot of methane Worldwide we need a huge change in diet Drastic decrease in meat and dairy production and consumption We can all do something though Car pool We can easily halve the number of car on the road with organised car pooling It s an app waiting to happen Cut your meat and dairy intake by half or better go vegan Fly le this one is a tough one for me love to travel Next time you see beef or steak in a menu or in a shop or some battery farmed meat any meat that doesn t say free range just say no Or again just go vegan
jamesoneful	wealthy west stupid comment
Will Moffett	It seems like there is a new class of climate denier out there leftist who don t realize or acknowledge the destruction of our habitat is a foregone conclusion We had a window once we realized what we were doing to correct it That moment ha passed It s time to start thinking of way to adapt to climate change than rather stop it Fossil fuel are essential to maintaining a military Getting off fossil fuel therefore is like voluntarily putting your gun back in your holster in the middle of a Mexican standoff
sk0sH	Hmm I think we re fucked After that line about needing to rebuild the entire world s energy infrastructure yeah that s not going to happen We have 12 year to do that
ravagetime	The UN is just begging to be relevant
Cherrie Getison	I will just say for the individual cutting out beef is a really good thing Cow methane burping and farting contributes to global warming more than transportation and cattle ranching is the biggest reason for deforestation in the Amazon But we shouldn t act like each individual is equally to blame You and I will never imagine being able to compare to the carbon footprint damage that oligarch create

John Brooks	This whole climate change drive many crazy NO ONE EVER discus that if global warming is happening it ‚Äô s caused not by carbon but by the population of human on the earth In 1920 the population of earth wa 1 9 billion and 98 year later it ‚Äô s just over 7 billion Can anyone else see the cause and effect here Until we start to control this out of control population growth by mostly 3rd world country this carbon pollution will continue More people mean more resource which mean more pollution
Robert Deskins	Humans lost respect for the world they think they conquered it but the world doesn t NEED u and we are ENTIRELY dependent on the Earth for a place to live the sun to power the Earth the moon to be a gravity counter that prevents a Solar bulge tide from existing no moon super massive east to west tidal wave for whatever side face the sun every day Mainstream science say Homo Sapien Sapien modern human have existed 200 000 year with 5000 year of history but the Earth is 4 300 000 000 4 3 billion year old it ha existed 21 500 time longer than Homo Sapien Sapien and MANY time catastrophic event have nearly wiped out all life on this planet explosion so big they light the whole atmosphere on fire world wide CONFLAGRATION Earth will survive u and life will start over if it ha to
Brian Bob	I am afraid the repeated claim of environmental armageddon since the 70 s have blunted the effectiveness of claim like this

Hugh Jarse	Keep drinking the Koolade FFS No part of climate change is due to human activity This planet ha been heating up and cooling down for million of year long before man stood up and began to walk The sun is the culprit always ha been Carbon dating provides very clear evidence of this Greenland wa once Tropical then the ice age came The sun is a star All star eventually burn out Only then will Climate Change really matter Until then we all will find way to adapt Climate Change is the second greatest hoax of all time Human being can find way of cashing in on fiction We are very good at it and the apathetic sheeple type will buy into anything if they think it s necessary to sustain life

Cloud 9.1	Burning one gallon of gasoline 6 3 pound emits 20 35 pound of CO2 into the atmosphere That s 5 cubic meter of CO2 The atmosphere is currently 406 ppm CO2 4 part in 10 000 yet even at that extremely small concentration CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas For the 8 thousand year leading up to industrialization the atomosphere wa 260 to 280 ppm That wa already at the high end of the 800 000 year range Prior to that 10 000 year ago during the last ice age the CO2 level wa about 185 ppm The natural fluctuation is about 185 to 285 With industrialization we have spiked to over 400 ppm and rising extremely fast So ditch the fossil fuel Ride a damn bike As in bicycle Everybody want technology to solve this Maybe some personal responsibility regarding CO2 footprint of the individual would help Two trillion tree over 20 year would suck the CO2 level back down but we would have to simultaneously reduce output dramatically too Two trillion is 50 billion per year over those 20 year That s 8 tree per person per year Would that be asking too much to get this fixed But the dirty denialist is so damned concerned about his oh so precious money
Candy Coat	what if when we make the change we should have been doing all along anyways we find it also just a cycle the earth go through it would be a miracle if we have any control over mother nature like the demon spraying our sky and cloud seeding weather engineering they probably increase climate change the same scientist on both side are hard to trust

Tunder Bar	Jimmy you re a smart man You need to go back and do your homework on this It s a political scam The IPCC is a political panel out of the UN Political activism
onifot	The thing is the headline should read that the prediction are worse than you thought The model that these prediction come from have proven wrong 100 of the time Go back and find every or any global warming climate change prediction with a date that ha come to pas the prediction failed In science that mean your theory failed Some people require more evidence before they will even begin to become mildly skeptical fair enough Make an effort to notice prediction and timeline when the time come to pas and the prediction fails make a note How many failure do you need before you become skeptical

Marcus LaForge	Congratulations on yet another superb segment Mr Dore You successfully communicate your impassioned stance on this topic in a manner which resonates with myself and I am certain many of your viewer Indeed I credit it and you with being a catalyst in my decision to join the effort to save our world from this dire scenario And though the impending doom DOES seem unavoidable I would like to encourage you to maintain a modicum of optimism Be assured that the ability to overhaul our fossil fuel glutted energy infrastructure worldwide IS within our current technical grasp and remains a feasible achievement even within the meager amount of time frame the article allows u Our primary obstacle that need to be overcome is one few consider or are even aware of patent suppression of technology which disrupt the status quo it is because of this little known fact that I myself have waited until today to come forward with my contribution to battle the tide which threatens to engulf u and all we hold dear Again my sincere thanks for inspiring me to rouse myself off the fence of personal indecision FYI http en m wikipedia org wiki Invention Secrecy Act

David Tremain	If you looked at scientist who are largely being ignored they are saying that a huge part of the solution to CC in addressing the IPCC report is to engage in the most reliable safe and proven energy we have that is being pushed aside by environmentalist It ‚Äô s a fact look it up in scientific journal white paper even law suit you ‚Äô ve likely not heard about wind turbine solar panel and other renewables with the exception of hydro will never put a dent in the energy problem of fossil fuel replacement The only meaningful direction in change is to have a massive federal government program that lead to the 2nd nuclear energy era

Phil Racicot	The first thing we need to do for this world is not to have kid It happens to be the easiest solution and the one that cause least problem Most educated and secular population already have low birth rate below replacement rate of 2 child per couple But if some part of the world don t achieve that because of religion and lack of education we need to help them figuring it out because otherwise we ll all end miserable and suffering The problem with some religion is that they ve convinced people to accept suffering during their lifetime to get rewarded afterwards Believers can t find dead people who d argue they didn t get what religion promise after life so it probably is true With this vision of thing there s no problem if you have kid that are also miserable a they ll be saved when their life end Now the question is who benefit from the growing size of the population and why it s not something that s widely spread by medium and governents all around the world Because even in the country that have steady or declining birth rate government and corporation are searching for more immigration to help growing the economy and to help keeping the wage low Here in Canada one thing we constantly hear is that there s a worker shortage While we hear that there s a big part of the population that s inactive unemployed or employed at wage that don t allow them to have a good quality of life life is expensive around here because of the amount of energy we need to use to survive Deforestation isn t an issue that s a serious here a elsewhere and we still have a low density of population but because of our harsh climate we need a lot more energy just to survive So decreasing the population in region of the world where people survive with a minimum of energy use to increase it here by immigration ha bad consequence on the environment That sound like a right wing anti immigration talking point and it probably is but something ha to be done seriously about that

LSG	If you look back at geologic time frame you would see that temperature have been 6 to 8 degree higher while CO2 wa at about the same level a it is today In the past temperature have fallen a CO2 increased and temperature have increased a CO2 decreased Maybe there is some external force at work here independent of CO2 I wonder what it could be

Brett Sears	Wow you people are gullible The reason this report came out is because their previous report said that we would all die by 2020 Well 2020 is almost here and the only thing that ha changed is that the climate is cooling 3 inch of snow in the Midwest in October If the world is getting warmer you will not get colder event Last year there were hundred of all time historic low temperature Tell me how you get so many all time historic low temperature if the world is getting hotter This is just basic reasoning The UN is just putting the next set of doomsday prediction out 20 year again They keep moving the total destruction of the earth when it start to get near and nothing ha really changed There is so much wrong with Global Warming renamed climate change because the government know it is a lie The weather and temperature are cyclical They are not a straight line It ha to do with how the earth revolves on it axis and how it rotates around the Sun The earth axis rotation change a doe it rotation around the sun CO2 is a beneficial gas If you remove all CO2 the earth will die Plants and tree use CO2 to grow So the only thing that ha happened with the higher CO2 is that the planet ha gotten greener Just do a little research and see area on the globe that are now green Greenhouse owner have known this for 50 year They put 30 000 ppm into the greenhouse so that plant will grow 36 faster Add in that the super Rich bank and insurance company are still making 20 year loan and long term insurance policy in area that are predicted to be underwater in 2 year from the first report There ha been no significant rise in Ocean level even though the UN said it would rise 10 to 100 foot by 2020 Do you think the super rich would give you a 20 year loan in an area that they thought there wa even a small chance it would be under water They dont sell flood insurance if you live in a flood zone yet they sell it in area predicted to be underwater do to global warming Just maybe they know something you don t like Global Warming is a hoax to make them billion of dollar from the panicked sheep Jimmy keep saying how corrupt government are yet think they are telling the truth about this and not just scaring the sheep so they can make billion of dollar Why are they wrong about everything except this one thing LOL Anyone who belief global warming should be ashamed 50 year ago the government said we were going to be in a new Ice Age and million would die Now they are saying we are in an inferno and million will die Why would you buy the same story over and over Invest in cold weather gear the earth is currently in a global cooling cycle Some reputable scientist not paid by government grant are predicting this cooling cycle could last for 150 year Expect to see more snow and more historic low temperature around the world

ex0duzz	Here s some good news to counter this The blond in this video talk about reforestation But what about China s great green wall It s a project China started in 1978 which aimed to lessen and to stop creeping desertification in the gobi desert Since 1978 China ha planted over 66 BILLION TREES and currently China plant more tree than the rest of the world COMBINED It s planned fi be completed by 2050 and it will be 4 500 km long 2 800 mile While USA is building great wall to keep refugee out China is building great green wall to save their country and the world What s good for China is incidentally also good for the world With climate change the dust storm are just going to get continually worse a time pass Every year China loses 3 600 km2 1 400 sq mi of grassland to the gobi desert losing a much a 2 000 km2 800 sq mi of topsoil to dust storm I have confidence that a country and government such a China s will be able to meet the challenge of climate change but if the rest of the world can not do what China doe then China can only delay the inevitable China can pollute now to catch up after industrialisation but it can also do massive green project and just change their social policy and law concerning environment at the drop of a hat due to them being authoritarian and centralised and united But what about USA One president join Paris accord and the next rip it up One president support EPA and the next appoints EPA chief a someone who want to end the EPA This not only ha the negative effect of wasting time and money that we can t afford to waste but it erodes global confidence in USA and global framework to tackle global warming and climate change When USA president say thing like he s gon na bring back coal and coal job etc that s being pathetically short sighted and indifferent I don t think democracy allow for long term plan like China s great green wall project which started in 1978 and will finish in 2050 Same a their belt and road initiative It s setting up the framework for long term global dominance USA can not compete v China in those aspect but the real sad thing is that USA doe not even try to compete The world would benefit immensely if USA got into a green tech war with China See who can plant the most tree see who can go off fossil fuel and into renewables and nuclear the fastest China is already doing all those thing and is the world leader in green tech USA is sticking to fossil fuel and waging endless war to continue to exploit oil for money and power even at the cost of the world through pollution and global warming Just go to show everyone how selfish indifferent and dare I say EVIL the USA is

Robert Tony	The problem with climate change forecast is they represent average and do not take into account weather extreme so dangerous outlier come closer to norm and climate shift to statistically accomadate them How bad can weather extreme be and out of control heating event in northern clime releasing methane generating more heat and releasing more methane et al and this resulting in rapid short term northern clime heating event releasing say a metre of sea level rise in one weather event You can not forecast for this it will just happen when it happens you can only calculate the probability outcome and take step to mitigate the harm It will probably happen this is a huge amount of methane frozen in northern clime and frozen there for hundred of thousand year that first metre of sea level rise will likely be far sooner than most realise

Brendan Thompson	None of the worst climate change prediction have come to pas No increase in hurricane snowfall is the same no increase in drought no increase in tornado Ocean level is increasing at 8 inch per century a it wa prior to the industrial era The East Antarcitc is losing ice though 2014 wa record sea ice there while the West is gaining All of the worst prediction are based on extremeley sensitive and highly speculative climate model that give you any result you care to model Ocean acidification is completely speculative since there is no system to measure global PH and even if there wa what record would it be compared to Even the arcitc sea ice data only extends back to 1980 with the launch of sattelite measuring Is that enough of a data set We have absolutely no way to know where this is all heading but it is unlikely to be the worst case scenario put forward by the IPCC For 50 year we were told that increased dietary consumption of cholesterol led to increased cholesterol in the blood That wa just settled science Today we know this isn t true So what happens if the IPCC and the climate model are wrong Will we start to doubt scientist and ignore their prescient warning on a bona fide disaster And if your going to get rid of carbon how No one reading this is giving up their plane flight to Hawaii Wind and solar are not cost competitive with natural gas and that is the single greatest obstacle Never mind that it take something close to 15 year for a solar cell to earn back the carbon used in it manufacturing

Natalie Roy	Go vegan they say it s the solution to everything Good health helping the planet and animal Ok Step one research research research Make sure you fully understand the nutritional requirement needed to have a balanced and healthy diet Step Two consult with a nutritionist who specializes in vegan and vegetarian diet to further ensure you and your family are getting all their nutritional need met Step three transition over a few week and learn where to buy healthy whole food not junk food vegan food Step five Hooray you are a vegan enjoy your new lifestyle 9 month later after losing copious amount of hair and suffering from severe gastrointestinal issue and further consulting with a nutritionist to make sure you are getting what your body need finally admit your body can not thrive on this diet Despite this purist vegan insist without knowing a single thing about my diet will tell me you were doing it wrong because they refuse to acknowledge that the diet isn t a one size fit all solution Now I advocate for harm reduction not absolutism If the vegan diet work for you so be it but many can strive to reduce their overall intake of meat and still have a positive impact Don t eat it at every meal or daily reduce your portion size ect Research other way to reduce your carbon footprint because climate change is going to take a multi prong approach and anyone who belief it will be solved by simply getting rid of the meat industry is fooling themselves or ha political ideology they want to push
ThomasNSherrod	Reforestation is needed Green technology too How about stop having kid Why do we need more big family people in the world The world s population continues to grow No one should have more than say two child It s irresponsible Carbon foot print etc At this point It s all about delaying climate change I m a vegetarian but if everyone slowed down their meat consumption could delay in theory What s so tragic is the tipping point is on it s way It s not stopping Water war are coming while top world scientist Al Gore fade into the sunset Too little too late The earth will evolve without u Money win Glad I live on a hill Trading my bicycle in for a dinghy

Kendra Watkins	reforestation will take to long and there is now tested co2 withdraw actually tested in large scale and the risk factor of something going bad is so high We are going to sail past 4 C in a decade The arctic ice will be gone within the nest few year and methane release will wrap up quickly and this will push the global temp way past 2 C within a few year We have no chance of survival a a specie
Johnny Jones	So the story they are selling is that human are the cause of a change of climate and not the sun cycle And Everyone agrees with this This coould be the only reason for 1 5 degree of said warming The fact that the sun is in a grand solar minimum cycle ha nothing to do with climate or weather and it all because of c02 emission This isn t political but strictly scientific If you believe this you are a brainwashed fool A volcano could emit the same amount of c02 within the same amount of time period and the IPCC s solution would be to bury the volcano with lot of dirt and everyone would pay a certain amount of tax to pay for the dirt and tractor and dump truck This is how ridiculous the current narrative of climate change is

Ambesh Pratik	The fact that this issue is so controversial really show the level of propaganda in Western country Global warming is just a real a the fact that earth is round Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that trap infrared radiation making the earth warm enough for the living thing to exist The carbon dioxide level ha increased in the atmosphere and so ha the warming a a result of it The reason scientist know that this is because of human activity is because of the increase in c12 isotope in the atmosphere which is found in plant and animal that are used to extract fossil fuel after they are dead and buried for a long time This is not controversial among physicist Chemist or climatologist Regardless of who support what these fact remain to be true You only have to know basic science to know this Those who want to deny ought to prove a lot more than just saying temperature is not rising when it clearly is do they mean that carbon dioxide level ha not increased do they mean the greenhouse effect is not real Climate change denier and flat earthers are the laughing stock in the scientific community but I think it bodes the scientist well to educate people who have been brainwashed instead of ridiculing them I am a poor graduate student of physical chemistry My country ha been suffering from an abnormal amount of flood and drought in recent year I only wish that people would come together and fight it globally I don t like the democratic party of U S and I can t vote so I have nothing political to say about it This is bigger than any political party Please wake up before it too late

Klaus 003P84	Hey Jimmy you re right with that title in my opinion but I fear that feedback loop that you were talking about starting at 4 degree average warming have started all ready the most terrifying one the methane emission from natural source seafloor or permafrost have started to leak in 2010 back then nasa started the project carve to gather data around the condition of methane release take a look at interview of natalia shakova a researcher at east sibirian arctic sea the ticking of the timebomb is the loudest there Love you jimmy keep it up Loved to see chris hedge on your show
Rick Ducharme	We will do those thing that you say we won t do and we ll do it the only way it will ever be possible to do it We ll do it by democracy over the wish of the corporate tyranny that rule u That tyranny is large and in charge presently a we all know only too well They know very well that we have the potential power to change the world and it scare them to death In the meantime you know it s getting depressingly bad when you see Bernie out there cheering on corporate republican lite democrat for office and exhorting everyone to get out and vote to install these useless parasite who only do the bidding of their corporate master Really Bernie Why is it important to keep voting in these corporate tool The argument can be made that the republican are 10X worse because they are But I would argue that it s better to let the republican destroy themselves and the entire system so that it finally collapse than to forestall that inevitable collapse by electing the like of Obama Clinton et al After the collapse people will finally wake up and hopefully the attending change of consciousness will enable u to move on in the right way so that we can live in harmony with nature by doing those thing that we must do in order to survive Love your show love Stef love your guest You re doing a great job and we need your voice Carry on Cheers

Brandin Shaeffer	Analysis show that animal study actually are incredibly unreliable because the animal used are NOT human But corporation LOVE this because in many case a positive result in their testing is all they need to tout it benefit even all the while knowing that the same study CAN NOT be replicated on people SAME with petri dish study though What happens in a petri dish is often not replicated in human trial The scientist just want grant money PERIOD The company just want that FDA clearance PERIOD

Frank Blackcrow	Getting rid of meat agriculture would that work a to not eat meat we would have to keep killing all the animal to keep them in check seeing a they say methane from cow is a problem what happens when we stop eating meat the cow are left to keep going a they would have or do we wipe them off the planet a like they did to the bison to stop the Indians from their agricultural practice of meat farming with free range don t forget if more people will be eating vegetable that mean more agricultural land would need to be obtained or do we eat kelp and other product that some have said like roach and other bug all would still need to be mass produced or do we do what they want with how that they did in the movie 1984 and stop people from unlawful reproduction and create a fake war just to keep wiping out the population a to that end of not needing to feed a many people or cloth them or to have them being the reason for global warming because when it all come down to it the cow wont care it s u that it come down to what do we do because we know what the government would do put everyone to a system that they control and tell everyone that they need to do it for their our own good and that everyone will agree to it a being the only solution a the government know what their doing for u because thats what they will agree to that they say we agree to because if you don t agree they will arrest you and send you off to a fake war just like the middle east is to wipe out a over bearing population of a certain part of the world but that they just keep breading like rabbit Cows are not the problem

Lazylady	There seems to be a general lack of understanding about climate change The earth s climate ha always changed whether there are human or not There have been ice age and other age with tropical climate At one time the central US wa an ocean At one time the Sahara wa green The climate and the earth are always changing Humans need to learn to adapt to the earth and it change instead of trying to force an artificial constant changeless environment The government ha realized the futility of going against the earth s change when it stopped putting sand on beach or keeping barrier island in the Atlantic from eroding Barrier island are not meant to be eternal Beaches disappear Humans may have accelerated the climate change However human really don t understand the process of climate change since civilization is only 5000 year old according to historian Technology is only about two century old Humans can inadvertently cause harm by interfering in a natural process like causing super wild fire when they prevented naturally occurring small wildfire which helped to replenish the wilderness We need to understand the natural process more before we create unnatural mean to solve problem that we don t fully understand

Scalisi	a whole food plant based diet is better for your health the environment and of course the animal there is no sustainable form of animal product that would scale to a global level especially a the world continues to adopt our western diet most animal product are unhealthy but certainly are not necessary to be healthy animal product commodify sentient being for our pleasure of taste which is unjustifiable in the modern age switching to a plant based diet is not difficult or expensive just eat vegetable fruit bean lentil soy seed nut etc although vitamin b12 is included in many fortified food like plant based milk it s literally the only supplement you ll possibly need on a proper whole food plant based diet going vegan is the least you can do and is a completely voluntary act which make it a non partisan issue if you want peace in the world don t just wish for it start acting by removing the unnecessary violence on your plate there s a reason ag gag law were enacted to keep animal cruelty behind closed door people are inherently against animal cruelty which is unnecessary harm to animal raising animal for slaughter in 2018 is the definition of animal cruelty given it s completely unnecessary if you can t go vegan overnight reduce your consumption of animal product a best a possible over time which includes product made from animal body leather wool etc entertainment that us animal zoo aquarium etc product tested on animal etc Cheers

Gavin Sealey	Jimmy s short presentation provides a good introduction to the issue of the climate change catastrophy a a human specie and a individual we need to change our way Here are some of my suggestion for political and personal action 1 If you re in the west consume le Don t manufacture or buy unnecessary stuff 2 Share more Make sure no one starves even if it mean you eat le Make sure everyone ha a home even if it mean your home is smaller 3 Phase out meat and dairy farming We all need to move to veganism Is eating fish sustainable I like eating fish but we have to ask the question 4 Dont buy plastic toy plastic bag or plastic water bottle 5 Reduce the use of fossil fuel through sustainable green energy use and a drastic reduction in energy consumption 6 Don t even think about fracking Stop it now 7 Don t be a frequent flier You may be able to afford it but the planet can not Focus on making your local environment more appealing 8 Don t deforest Reforest 9 Rationalise production by taking essential industry into public ownership 10 Learn to repair stuff rather than replace it 11 Don t think going to nuclear power is going to help Disasterous weather condition and degraded supply infrastructure can lead to Fukashima type incident 12 Move globally nationally and personally from a competition mindset to a cooperation mindset 13 Work for global disarmament and repurpose the military to disaster relief and environment protection force 14 Work for change in your own local community but communicate and coordinate with other community regionally and globally 15 Meditate and pray Things are going to get very rough and we re going to need acceptance faith and love to get u through
tod jones	Jimmy if you don t bring on one or more of the independent scientist that contradict this whole climate change meme I m going to have to withdraw my pateron support You are blindly going along with the government propaganda of the goofy left I had to stop supporting Bernie too since he continues to use the climate a a political weapon I dare you to have someone not on the federal gravy train to give a different perspective

suresh thota	we can cut global emission in half before trump leaf office the key word is we if we all go vegan it take 2 week or 2 month to go vegan not decade if we go vegan the amount of farm land required will be cut in half because we don t need all that land to feed animal we can covert it back to forest and that alone will cut net global emission in half the second half is the difficult part that requires govt and company involved to fix our energy system

eclectic earthlover	On the subject of how we might feed ourselves in a way that is better for the planet I keep hearing in left circle about meat consumption being an environmental problem I am familiar with some other viewpoint that seem to be ignored or unknown Have you all checked out PERMACULTURE Something like that need to replace agriculture a we know it not just industrial agribusiness agriculture a it s been done for millennium Should grazing animal be a part of that sort of permaculture system Lots of people believe they have to be to better imitate natural system Should herbivore all be protected from carnivore predation and be allowed to die of old age How do you think the ecosystem would handle that And can my three cat a well a myself die of old age please and not malnutrition Check Joel Salatin Alan Savory Chris Kresser and too many permaculture vids on youtube to really keep up with
Godzilla Burger	Where is the data that say we are 2 degree above normal As far a I know we are only 0 14 degree above normal and this ha been this way for a decade They ve been saying this shit for 15 year Don t get me wrong I think rebuilding the energy infrastructure is long overdue BUT there is record snow and cold around the world in AUGUST The polar sea ice level is RISING Snow on Antarctica is INCREASING Look it up University of Georgia iirc ha been publishing this for month The meat industry is fucked Strip mining on land and sea is fucked But the climate is influenced by the SUN We are NOT the warmest ever Not by far Look it up This is more fear mongering and Jimmy is a patsy and he doesn t even know it yet Too bad he didn t look into this data more

Nick Gardner	Jimmy read up about the Eocene Carbon dioxide and temperature level far far higher than today but the earth wa a verdant planet with forest growing right up to the Arctic and on Antartica There wa little or no ice anywhere and no land wa locked up in a permafrost a we have today Coral reef were to be found all over the planet outside of the polar region As now it wa a beautiful planet Sea level were a lot higher so New York London Tokyo Sydney etc etc would be fine diving site The earth will be just fine the risk are only to u

meermuizen	Global Warming is a massive industry a tax collector and yet although there are and will be huge temperature change there will be huge disaster of biblical proportion all true but NOT due to global warming We have started on a mini ice age comparable to the maunder minimum ours is the Eddie minimum Throughout history the sun ha had it cooling period long period of no sunspot etc so please do some research or just stick to the word climate change Till now Al GOres prediction have not come true Extinction of the polar bear well just for the record they are doing great Time to discover the truth my friend Eyes open No fear

jjutt87	The documentary is called Salt of The Earth
Bundle of Perceptions	We are already at 2 degree warming Just stop burning coal and let the aerosol drop out of the atmosphere and the global temperature will be 2 degree C above pre industrial average not the 0 9 1 3 degree they claim we are at That s why we are blowing past the tipping point ice is melting methane is being released from ice shelf and permafrost forest are starting to die off and wildfire are getting more intense The aerosol have tamped down the temperature for a while but it is now being overpowered by more and more CO2 so the temperature will begin to rise again at a faster pace Nothing short of removing a massive amount of CO2 out of the atmosphere will have any effect on the outcome we face Removing that amount of CO2 will cost trillion of dollar so fugetaboutit

Jonathan Vince	What you are saying will happen in Ten year NOT 20 or 30 year if we human keep the same thing going on Nuke Power is a huge factor to harming the planet Because it is HOT and take extremely long time to cool any thing nuclear a in radioactive Countries have been dumping the wast in to the sea in concrete Blocks Then there is the coal and oil to run everything disaster is looming Time for people invention to be used that run on none pollution fuel

jimmy bead	Jimmy thank you for doing this we need an ecologically regenerative agricultural system It would take immediate action in creating more small scale local organic food system utilizing ecologically and socially regenerative idea No till farm like Singing frog farm Neversink farm and the broadfork farm are building soil and storing carbon and sharing how to do it It would take people consuming le energy and natural resource Back to living simply within the ecological cycle and function The problem is that people don t look in their own lifestyle to do what they can to support those striving for better system worker owned fairtrade organic regenerative sustainable healthy and avoiding and divesting from those using destructive system corporate industrial chemical agriculture processed junk food fast food corporate industrial food distributer But people don t wan na change and grow their own food or cook their own food or find an ethical job and boycott corrupt corporation making all this happen Who do you think funded the environmental situation we re in ITs all of u Living off the system destroying the planet ANd until people accept that and find a many way to change their own decision and lifestyle and become whistleblower in their own life this course we are heading down will only get worse you can talk about it until you re red in the face but until you do something you re doing nothing
Maxwell Hoffman	Nellie rock haha
soraya bradley	Hey Jimmy try engaging with Kiss the Ground or Soil Carbon Cowboys or Singing Frog Farms or cafe gratitude try watching Christine Jones or Gabe Brown Farmers are going bankrupt with synthetic imputs which are destroying the carbon content of the soil so conservative capitalist farmer are failing due to corporate lie Animal waste and compost is needed to grow good root structure and use photosynthesis to grow food and draw carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere and restore it to the soil Agro ecology and regenerative agriculture expert say if we drawdown 4 per 1000 of carbon we can offset greenhouse emission Corporates would have you believe that synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and monoculture is the way to farm it not it destroying diversity destroying soil microbial life and polluting our waterway it not the cow it the how
delosombres	Lol People in the US don t even care about being pushed into illegal war by foreign nation a well a about corruption in politics and supporting dictator do you think they re gon na care what will happen after 50 year Hahaha
AngryLotus	You know for decade I have been arguing with people online and irl with a simple question I don t care if we are causing it or not why aren t we even attempting to do anything about it Nothing Zero Our pathetic attempt at staving off our own destruction to me mean we more than deserve EXACTLY what we are heading towards Better luck next attempt human some will survive and try again in a few 10 of thousand of year This session is well and truly past worth saving

Garry Cole	The thing is that the right wing know it is coming but the rich oligarch have already started on their survival bunker They have spent million of dollar on them and meanwhile selling to the stupid fascist Christian right that climate change is a hoax It is ironic because isn t it like Noah building the ark and warning other people about the incoming disaster Instead this Noah is a billionaire and building his ark and telling the public oh yeah everything is okay while he smile and planning for his survival and their doomed

James B	The IPCC report is authored by a many non scientist a scientist and is simply directly stated a political not scientific document The feedback loop are ever present and don ‚Äô t need a 2 degree warming to ‚Äú begin ‚Äù The most harm this report doe more than ignoring much of the relevant climate data is refocus all environmental conversation away from POLLUTION which is just a urgent but completely ignored Rest assured we will do nothing about climate change nor pollution and we ‚Äô ll just sit and wait for everything to devolve into chaos and war Cornel West for President Richard Wolf for VP or visa Versace doesn ‚Äô t really matter

equinos111	Human extinction for a dollar
No Body	Get this into your head Jimmy There is no way that human can control the temperature of this planet None If you truly believe CO2 is a toxin that will kill all of u then go plant a bunch of tree Trees use CO2 and sunlight to create breathable air through photosynthesis everyone know this Paying more tax doe not create oxygen or reduce CO2 Plant tree or stop breathing are your only two option Carbon tax and banning straw are a scam These people will take all your money and do nothing to help you They are scaring you into increased tax to make you feel good but 99 of the world doe not care about global warming They are poor and they only care about surviving Take responsibility if you believe global warming is real Go get some seed and go plant a million tree Otherwise you are wasting your life man When did liberal start buying into end of the world prophet selling salvation at the cost of more and more money Sounds pretty basic to me You are getting scammed

Rock'on	We need to address Real pollutant like mercury and lead in water not a pollutant that you produce while breathing Tax on CO2 is a tax on Oxygen because the CO2 come from Oxygen consumption Most of CO2 come from industry taxing them will result in a rise on product price and we the people will end up paying this tax on food clthing electronics In what way it will reduce CO2 emission help me Just put regulation to eliminate all pollutant from industry And I would begin with industry dumping waste in river everywhere in the world Then the air THEN you charge FINES on people polluting our planet What the medium are doing right now is shaming people for living their life Your 15 minute drive to go to work IS NOT the cause of the apocalypse

John Dickinson	4 30 more precisely positive feedback loop negative feedback loop stabilize a system positive feedback loop destabilize a system example of positive feedback loop in earth s climate system climate change icecap melt water get darker albedo drop le sunlight is reflected back into space more sunlight is absorbed i e turned into heat climate change climate change tundra permafrost melt methane gas released into atmosphere climate change climate change change in rain pattern desertification le CO2 uptake and sedimentation from plant more CO2 in atmosphere climate change climate change warming of ocean water lower ability of water to absorb CO2 degassing of CO2 from ocean into the atmosphere climate change there are negative feedback loop a well which help to stabilize the climate system But there s no reason to assume that the negative feedback loop will magically intensify when the positive feedback loop do And then there is also hysteresis If the jetstream were to drastically slow down due to a warming of the arctic region that would most likely be a permanent shift that will not be able to be reset by any mean we know of The effect would be fairly quick and irreversible

William Calhoon	Dr Guy McPherson website Nature Bats Last sum it up best On the edge of extinction only love remains What Dr McPherson point out is sea level rise is meaningless because human will be long gone before coastal city flood Why As global temperature rise the heating of inner continent will destroy the grain crop Rice wheat corn soybean will no longer be able to be grown No grain no Homo sapiens So starvation is the what the coming apocalypse is all about When will this begin Dr McPherson estimate we will lose summer arctic ice maybe a soon a 2019 but definitely no later than 2026 With our global air conditioner gone it won t be long before runaway climate change take u all down

Mr Boompi	Jimmy I love you to death but you have been taken in by the UN and their unscientific bullshit The only thing that will be catastrophic is the globalist tax increase and totalitarian control thee people seek to foist upon u The catastrophic warming forecast you mention will not occur They are not supported by either historical data or atmospheric measurement Over the past 10o year there ha been a little overall warming between 5 and 1 0 deg C The hot decade of the 1930s occurred before the level of CO2 were affected by human activity In fact the data support the fact CO2 ha nothing to do with whatever climate change we are experiencing Please look around for the truth about climate change

Rollin Shultz	I up voted the video and you all made some great point I thoroughly disagree with the UN s climate model and find they have proven time after time to be drastically incorrect That being said I am a fervent proponent of mankind living in harmony with nature some time ago I realized there wa a bait and switch that took place and it wa arranged by major corporation Environmentalists were making much progress at curbing major polluter due to a program where they could get reward money for exposing corporate pollution So said major corporation funded climate change study to promote the evil of climate change which they would blame on everything but themselves and also provide the solution in the form of carbon trading scheme which would for a small percentage of their profit allow them to continue polluting Those corporation own government and no method of giving government more power will enable mankind to reverse this progress of living against nature MY solution is based on personal responsibility Consumers must take responsibility for every dollar they spend to defund the major polluter by not buying their stuff For Americans this mean not automatically buying imported good Though some thing must be imported such a coffee and rubber most thing such a furniture and most food can be made here in our country The benefit to changing our spending behavior are 1 Less pollution and resource wasting burning diesel fuel to transport unnecessary good around the world That also go for poisoning of the ocean buy exporting our recycling over sea on open barge through storm etc 2 We can lessen the impact of all industry by consuming le and wasting le If we don t buy stuff they won t make it 3 By purchasing fresh food at local market we can save much on such impact a huge amount of refrigeration of transported and stored food We also would eliminate the need for plastic packaging Your local farm market typically wrap your good in some easily and locally recyclable butcher paper and for more friendly method we could use returnable ceramic pot and urn for soup coffee bean and other item 4 We can exit the beat the Jones race and stop trying to have everything we see Before industry le people had everything they wanted If you wanted a piece of furniture you contracted a local tradesman to make it for you out of often locally sourced material It therefore wa more expensive to obtain but after having spent a month to two of pay for one piece you had tremendous respect for your stuff It didn t mean you could never have what wealthier people have it just meant you couldn t have it all right away Aside from the immediate gratification there is up side to buying cheap good that last a few year and which you get tired of after a few year because there wa no sacrifice to obtain them I am trying to make the point that it is not the responsibility of those outside of ourselves to make the needed change It make no sense to me so many people cry about climate change and when I drive by Walmarts and other mega store the lot are always full I get this image of someone holding a government please help sign in one hand and a knife at their throat in the other You can t even blame it in industry itself for being greedy and underhanded in their dealing by bribing government and brainwashing the people through TV commercial created by marketer with psychology degree It is the nature of industry Industries are constantly pushing an envelop of saturation and they must constantly compete for market share so profit must come first They are in a constant flux of building more factory to get more market share which requires more loan and profit loss plus the cost of bribing official advertising etc The only way to defeat any industry is defunding stop buying their stuff I am no Ludite I embrace good technology and avoid the bad We are very fortunate we can have computer and live somewhere in the mountain in a log cabin simultaneously I believe every homeowner should take responsibility for producing their own power using solar wind and whatever they can Homeowners could plan that into the cost of buying a home If your budget is say 200K you might expect to invest 40 of that in energy production So you buy a 120K house and invest 80K in energy independence That way it is planned into the mortgage So I say forget Climate Change instead strive to live in harmony with nature individually Give you business to local farmer and business and only such factory producer that are responsible with the environment and I mean really not just that s what they claim or because they donate a little money to the odd tree planting etc Open your eye to where your money go and what it accomplishes for whom

MaoTseFunkadelic	They seem to be over estimating the role of specifically animal agriculture factory farming and deforestation a the source of climate change It seems like vegan feel goodery They reality is that there is hardly any aspect of your life that is not contributing to climate change a nearly every aspect depends on industrial process and nearly every act of consumption add to incredible pile of waste In the first instance the link between deforestation and animal agriculture is mainly feed crop largely maize and soya being planted in greater quantity Poultry is the prime destination but the feed conversion ratio for poultry have improved dramatically I believe around 1 6 now It is not a if somehow if it were not for poultry Brazilian farmer would cease to try and expand their farm into the Amazon Farming becoming increasingly capital intensive is a feature of capitalism in general Moreover you can moralize about people eating too much meat but this feed is increasingly being geared to feeding China because surprise surprise it is one of the cheapest form of protein Not because people are greedy obese mofos Moreover pasture based animal are often the only form of agriculture that is viable for small farmer particularly in relatively drier area If you want large number of psuedo peasant farmer to simply stop producing cattle while you by god better be prepared to give them a decent income that will equate to the amount food traction and exchange value they get from their animal Step foot in a rural are in Asia or Africa and tell people they are dipshits for producing animal and they will rightly laugh at you This obviously doe not apply to beef feedlot which are the least energy efficient by a longshot But these are not all of animal agriculture Secondly on what basis is it being claimed for example that deforestation is MORE harmful than the ecological damage to algae and other oceanic plantlife which occupy a far higher proportion of the Earth s surface I get the central point of the video climate change is coming to get u hard but this a CAPITALISM problem not just one of a particular sector s production practice or of one form of rapacious consumption

Jess Fulbright	Jimmy I love you and this young woman you are speaking with ha a good heart and intention It saddens me to see that the Global Warming conspiracy theory ha gotten you too My field of expertise are nuclear physic and geology I worked most of my life in the pursuit of improved worker health and safety but am now retired For a hobby I started studying global warming in the 1990s I wa already pretty much convinced of AGW but I like data After 25 year of study I have come to two conclusion First there are multitude of factor that affect global climate and temperature but one stand out far above all the others and that is the sun Second the sun is not going to provide any global warming for the foreseeable future The fact is we are currently entering the bottom of solar cycle 24 which wa an extremely weak cycle Cycle 25 will be lower in amplitude and many are predicting that cycle 26 may be nearly nothing Solar forcing is diminishing galactic cosmic ray are increasing and our magnetosphere is collapsing The planet will cool for the next 25 year at the very least due to these factor and in spite of CO2 This trend will not necessarily end in 25 year earth could easily slide back into a major glaciation We are after all still living in the Quaternary Ice Age though many do not realize it This ha started already there is no stopping it Global temperature ha begun to fall and the next two winter will be eye opening a the sun go completely to sleep between cycle 24 25 It is kind of funny the trick that nature can play on you since 2007 people have been predicting an ice free arctic and I have heard many lately say next summer or the one after Reality will be exactly the opposite and by cycle 27 we will have forgotten global warming Murphy s law say that then the sun will come back to life and all of that new found heat will be trapped by the CO2 we forgot to continue to battle and we will all cook

James Gant	100 corporation reportedly contribute 71 of carbon emission and the US military much of the rest IF everybody in the US wa to switch to electric car and solar panel on their house with battery etc that would only cut emission by reportedly 20 to 25 So when we say that this is a problem of government you have to consider that there are cartel with more money and power than government those corporation But a silver bullet in this case would be graphene technology in graphene super capacitor and solar panel

AeroPwnX	Climate change is real and is not limited to Earth there is absolutely nothing human can do about this fact Destroying our planet for profit is absolutely wrong so is taxing those who are not responsible for the problem Biodiversity is the measure of our planet health not temperature or CO2 level Overpopulation is the greatest threat to our continued existence Earth ‚Äô s existence is not dependent on u Our sun ha completed it ‚Äô s main sequence and ha begun fusing helium into carbon It ha started it Red Giant phase where it will balloon in size while surface temperature drop and light output dims because it ‚Äô s further from the core Although surface temperature reduction is constant so is expansion the closer the surface get to the vicinity of planetary body the hotter they get All the planet in this solar system are heating up simultaneously this is a fact that CO2 tax supporter human climate change propagandist continue to ignore or refute

Michelle Espino	We only have one Earth There is no doubt in my mind that climate change is real I m no genius and I do not claim to be more informed about the climate than 99 of the world s climate scientist You bet if I thought I wa I would be submitting my research for a noble prize or at least for peer review But here is the thing even if there were a small chance that we are harming our planet with our pollution and deforestation mostly for animal agriculture wouldn t that be worth making a change I mean don t we put on our seatbelt because of the risk of bodily damage or at least the risk of being pulled over I wonder why no one argues against this practice It s most likely because fossil fuel company aren t campaigning to spread misinformation
Dirty Mike	Where Jimmy is wrong here is by trusting the IPCC et al Surprising that someone a aware a he doe The anti alarmist the non profiteering one obviously know that polluting is bad and we should be finding cleaner mean of energy However Carbon is a minor yet very easily taxed profited from and easy to find a sympathetic scapegoat u greenhouse gas Does it factor Absolutely But in the multivariate analysis a proven by the ice core themselves it is a more reactive gas to global temp increase than it is a cause for it Water vapour the sun is the PRIMARY culprit here IF there is critical warming at all and many study point to not Plenty of evidence to support this if one look beyond he corrupt NOAA IPCC NASA info Show me how we can control the sun s natural effect on our planet Does that mean that increased CO2 is a good thing and it won t hurt u eventually No But the timeline is something that perhaps 2 generation won t see The ocean across the world are too dynamic and too deep in 3 dimension for the IPCC math to work Look up Dr Judith Curry We ve backed the wrong horse in the renewable energy race wind and solar are wholly unreliable and are also co opted look at who hold the patent for most of those and the electric car tech and you might find a recognizable cast of character We ve also chosen the wrong greenhouse gas a the culprit If ppl reading this are not ravenous and dogmatic in their climate belief and are open to challenging information please go to www climate4you com Very unbiased fact based climate info Also look in to James Corbett at Corbettreport com or here on YouTube Guy is nothing if not thorough in his research Jimmy if you read these comment GET CORBETT ON YOUR SHOW AND DISCUSS CLIMATE POLICY AND BIG OIL ETC It will be more than worth it

OSCAR CHAVOYA-ACEVES	Climate scientist and the medium have been making a mistake when they address this issue focusing on temperature instead of internal energy Let me explain ice melt at constant temperature that s thermodynamics and while it melt it internal energy increase 79 72 kcak kg which is enough heat to raise the temperature of one kg of water by 79 72 degree We can expect that we will know what global warming is when the ice is gone Then we will see the true face of the beast

Ebon Shadow	The planet is fine we are fucked
Unfettered Fire	In an indirect way Rachel Carson gave u neoliberalism because her book Silent Spring ignited the environmental movement which forced through protection legislation which resulted in the impeachment of Nixon by the fossil fuel industry which spurred the Lewis Powell call to arm for private industry to seize control of government which exempted legislation so that fracking could destroy US soil air and water and the SC could be filled with Koch appointed judge like Neil Gorsuch whose mother Anne had to resign in disgrace a EPA head during the Reagan year and Kavanaugh who will be focused on repealing Chevron Deference giving the SC the power to gut the rest of the environmental legislation Right now Monsanto Bayer is riddled with thousand of lawsuit and there s a youth climate movement that want to bring their case to the SC Not all country are like the US thank God In his new book A New Foreign Policy Beyond American Exceptionalism Jeffrey Sachs address the fact that We don t look after each other at all in America today We don t because the small radical right group led by libertarian Koch money want it that way Sachs discus the quality of life and the environmentally friendly infrastructure in Stockholm Oslo and Copenhagen They re not falling apart actually they re kinda gorgeous Every worker enjoys 5 or 6 week summer paid vacation a a matter of every worker right They are living very very comfortably and productively In other word they are living in the cleaner saner 21st century So why this agenda to hold America back in some Orwellian fossil fuel soot soaked neofeudalism

max bootstrap	The UN and their research group most of which are actually advocacy group are total liar AGW is pure political contrived fiction As for being worse than we thought you really do need to remember to go back and review your own prediction including half of San Francisco will be under water by 2013 Hmmm let me see is it really worse than that Duh I ve checked coast where I have lived and the water level ha not changed enough for me to see any difference AGW is pure political fraud to justify globalism funded by carbon tax or similar AGW wa chosen a the central propaganda of the globalists precisely because AGW would be a global problem that requires a global solution global government You guy are sucker BTW you are correct that most large corporation and all government are enormously if not entirely corrupt and you address some of their atrocity in other video I suggest you stick to those other issue because this AGW hysteria just take time away from important issue like exterminate Monsanto and eliminate all patent on DNA and food process and hundred of other REAL atrocity

Ryan Curry	We need to stop obscuring the truth of the problem This is not on individual to make limited voluntary change to their lifestyle The only reason we are in this mess is because of global capitalism and it grim addiction to fossil fuel and meat agriculture and the only thing that can possibly hope to avert the resulting catastrophic global extinction event is a socialist revolution in every developed country within the next half century Believing anything to the contrary is deluding yourself at the cost of life on Earth a we know it

Leroy boy	In the last 100 year the temp ha gone up 0 9 degree and half of that happened between 1918 and 1945 During that time there wa not enough man made CO2 according to current model to produce that rise The climate ha not changed since 2009 Climate scientist keep trying to change their model to account for the lack in the rise of temperature Jimmy you are right on some thing but you have been sucked in to this crappy science

sparkgap	I luv u Jimmy but you are 100 wrong on this The truth is we ‚Äô re actually entering a cooling period due to a reduction in sunspot activity which is also what ‚Äô s behind the increased tropical cyclone activity a well a the increase in earthquake and volcanic activity The Rothschild funded theory of ‚Äú man made global warming ‚Äù is just that it ‚Äô s a theory but one now on life support The original CO2 greenhouse warming theory wa popularized by Carl Sagan but this theory when applied to Earth ha been largely disproven But don ‚Äô t take my word for it do your own due diligence on Google scholar and you ‚Äô ll see For example during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum PETM 56 million year ago a huge natural spike in CO2 sent temperature on Earth soaring‚Äîbut life went on and the ocean remained intact Because ‚Äú the original sin of man ‚Äù doctrine from Christianity ha lost it guilt inducing power over the mass the elite had to remake this ‚Äú control mechanism ‚Äù in the modern era So they came up with this theory to bolster their new religion of ‚Äú the State ‚Äù known a globalism I ‚Äô m totally against corporate pollution needle production and consumerism but carbon taxing every human for simply breathing while filling the banker ‚Äô pocket will not address these important problem and only make them worse by creating the illusion that we solving them when we are not You have a great show but you lose credibility when you regurgitate Rothschild banker created talking point You are essentially committing idolatry mistaking a theory for reality itself

Suave sailor	Um It s not a bad a you think the sun is at a minimum of output now Up north we are getting colder weather earlier snow earlier snow ha already landed in North Central part of the U S earlier than year past Snow in early October is ridiculous snow used to land around later to the end of November For the last four year snow and cold have been earlier in date than ever Last three year it s been so cold no fan or air conditioner had been needed Ask a solar scientist they will tell you they are worried that this solar minimum will last longer and be at the edge of a mini ice age
David Coker	The surface temperature ha only gone up 9 10 of 1 degree in the last century The IPCC and all of their deceptive cohort know they have based their prediction on the false premise that the upper atmosphere will heat up much more rapidly over the Tropics than it actually doe Only the Russian model get it right because it is based on fact and not speculation See for yourself and stop believing all the horse ship Dore push http youtu be fA5sGtj7QKQ
Bob Spelledeitherway	first of all global warming climate change communism terrorism what do those term have in common main stream medium fear porn they cant call it pollution or controlled opposition why would they want you to know or for you to question who is polluting the planet when they can blame you for using their product the earth go though cycle which we have influence nor control if that were so we must have caused the last ice age call the polluter out don ‚Äô t use their term call it what it is
wakaisgood	I believe in climate change but a question to all of you who belief in man made climate change What percentage of climate change are we Humans responsible for It can ‚Äô t be 0 because we do have an impact yet it can ‚Äô t be 100 because we aren ‚Äô t Gods The reason why I want to know is that if our percentage impact is 10 then there ‚Äô s nothing we can do no matter if we dump 600 billion to fix it But if it ‚Äô s 80 then solar and green energy can ‚Äô t fix it We need Nuclear power

Inisfad	Do you not understand that NOT ONE of the IPCC ‚Äô s prediction ha EVER come true Or that scientist who disagree with the anthropogenic climate change ‚Äò science ‚Äô will NOT get funding or published Anthropogenic climate change is THE BIGGEST GLOBALIST HOAX that ha ever been perpetrated on the world ‚Äô s population FFS even Christina Figueres admits that the purpose of the climate change platform is reduction of world population and redistribution of world wealth If you are truly concerned with climate change forget this BS CO2 meme science ha already proven that CO2 FOLLOWS temp and doe not cause temp increase worry about deforestation etc The planet ‚Äô s climate is driven by the sun and the IPCC doe NOT even put sun activity into their computer model Why is a progressive site actually abiding by globalist platform

NAIVADA	Yes Jimmy this ha been pretty old f news for over more than 4 decade now When expert and scientist talk nowadays they no longer say that we better reduce emission and stuff They say we better fundamentally restructure the economic system itself ‚Äì which is the cause of the problem in the first place But hey Market capitalism make the world turn round so nice right 3 OTOH a long a human can accumulate monetary wealth there will always be greed and corruption and life will suffer ad Hi great info Love the show Peace

Enon Emouse	Jimmy you should recognise that you are way out of your comfort zone Humans have nothing to do with it It is the ‚òÄÔ∏è Check it out and do the research Suspicious Observers Electric Universe Thunderbolts Project will give you a start The math is perfect but the data is flawed wrong or distorted to fit the narrative that human caused climate change total change natural cause Not one study by mainstream science ha considered the influence of the sun s weather on our climate In fact on many many occasion it ha be found that data ha been adjusted to account for the effect of extraordinary solo activity to give a cause for the observation Ask yourself why is the Great Red Spot on Jupiter dissipating Is that also human caused It is also becoming evident that Venus climate is experiencing change There are even some article discussing climate change being observed on every planet on our solar system Look up on any sunny day and you ll quickly appreciate what control everything not only on this planet but everywhere in this system I see our understanding of the universe in the same way I see how we tend to understand a dog s behaviour we anthropomorphise and ignore that fact the dog is not human Dark matter black hole dark energy pulsar that are 18miles across and x10000 the mass of our sun rotating on it own axis faster than a dentist drill etc etc all in a vain attempt to explain the observation of an electric universe without considering electrical energy Bullshit in is bullshit out This is the 2nd time I ve posted a comment on one of your vids on climate change and I again urge you to dig deeper on this one Jimmy You want to be on the right side of this one By far the most dominate green house gas is water vapour and it the sun activity or inactivity that control the how much is present in our atmosphere

Mark Edwards	This is a much bigger problem than if we all go onto a plant based diet And to try and sell that we must all become vegetarian and it still will not solve the problem is exactly why many people are turned off from activist Have you ever seen the smoke and toxic plume when you light a can of oil We are currently burning nearly one million gallon of oil per minute worldwide We are currently burning nearly one million tonne of coal every two second worldwide Source http www poodwaddle com worldclock env3 We must fundamentally change our whole way of life to repent Not just change our diet Our way of life must return to similar to one hundred year ago Virtually no car Virtually no electricity except lighting Locally produced food no exotics No central heating No air conditioning No air travel No plastic No TV or monitor No smartphones That is what it is going to take It ain t gon na happen And no government that come anywhere close to suggesting these change will ever get elected It is a law of nature that everything must die If you lead the healthiest life style that ha ever been lived you will die Mortality ha always been a hard concept for our specie to accept though Religion prey on it

Gman 5250	I wa hoping to hear a cohesive conversation on Climate Change You fail to mention Stratospheric Aerosol Injection which is a massive contributor to greenhouse effect and you don t ever ever mention Fukushima Ocean bio mass die offs What is your position on Fukushima In Japan it is illegal to report on Fukushima but they are building the Olympic Complex directly adjacent to million of ton of lethally radioactive soil The northern hemisphere is in collapse but not for the reason the Progressives cling to like a religion calling dissenter Climate Deniers IPCC is massively biased and thoroughly exposed for producing faked flawed model and data R K Pachauri wa completely conflicted and made million through Tata Steel His connection to the Blood and Gore Chicago Climate Exchange are well documented Progressives and the left simply ignore the huge conflict of interest along with any other data that disagrees with their position You don t cite an ounce of real science to support your thesis and you fail to acknowledge the complete body of science available on this subject This is why I can t take Progressives seriously you continually use emotionally charged talking point but ignore the elephant in the room and promote well what do you promote sir If you are going to expose geo engineering weather weaponization and nuclear contamination there is an abundance of real data available The weather feed back loop is indeed very real but not resulting from the data promoted by IPCC who by the way even lied about the number or scientist who agreed to their study If and when Progressives begin to offer actual debate rather than pre packaged talking point independent like myself may may begin to look at you seriously Until then it s the same continual rhetoric hyperbolae and Media Matters talking point IMO

Jesus Elizondo	I m not at all for the big oil company they destroy our planet but the UN say You mean the technocrat that control everything say more tax or we die Just to let you know most scientist just go by a few report that are flawed The IPCC ha consistently changed data that doesn t fit their narrative like the 18 year low for one The same people that environmentaly destroy our planet are the same one pushing climate change think about that These scientist never mention the solar cycle solar system our our own weakening magnetosphere when calculating weather system The government ha been manipulating the weather since the 40 Look up Project Cirrus a joint collaboration between GE and the military a hurricane wa seeded and changed direction headed towards Savanah Georgia and caused havoc This wa again in the 40 imagine what they can do today The only reason the lawsuit didnt go through wa because they found evidence that one hurricane took a similar path in the early 1900s so they took the blame off human intervention but we know they will say whatever to keep blame off of them
Petra Kann	The important thing to note from any IPCC report is that the prediction are always conservative in order to get so many scientist and nation to sign off the report before publication So if the IPCC say the situation is grave then it s most likely far worse in reality Also the rate of warming of the planet is NOT linear it is accelerating with time We may have triggered some known and unknown tipping point earlier than expected The rate of warming 2010 is at least ten time higher than the rate of warming that end typical ice age And the ice core data date back to 800 000 year ago If you re not worried about yourself then perhaps you should be concerned about the future our child will inherit

Harvey Schaapman	The Paris Climate Agreement allowed China and India and others to be excused from any of the global warming requirement for up to twenty year While the USA wa required to fulfill all the new rule including pay for most of the funding to support the agreement Thank God Trump had the sense to say NO If you understood the ALL fact you d realize Trump offered to sign the Climate Agreement IF all the other county were required to obey the same set of rule a the USA wa required to do Especially China and India who have nearly half the world s population poluting this planet Plus he wanted them to pay their fair share they all said NO so Trump said GOODBY The more I listen to you the more I realize you re like a half baked apple trying to pas yourself off a a fully baked apple pie You re pathetic please GET INFORMED Stop being sooo stupid

John Klett	Actually the Financial Elites are worried about the Ice Age which is overdue Ice Ages happen every 11 500 year like clockwork going back hundred of million of year Global Warming is caused by the Sun and the entire solar system is warming due to charged particle from the Sun striking the core of the planet which is heating the earth from the inside out just like on Jupiter Mars etc What started this whole man made warming fraud wa the Nuclear Power Industry needed to infliuence public opinion against fossil fuel so they promoted the alternative But nuke were their goal Then the Financial Interests took over science funding through the US Government and came up with Carbon a the culprit to implement a global taxing strategy scheme The PR behind the current effort is for the Goldman Sachs Global Carbon Credit Exchange which wa to be signed into international law at Oslo by Obama but real scientist rebelled against it and so they backed off Meanwhile the real deal trigger point the achilles heel of the entire global weather system is the Gulfstream Current in the Atlantic Ocean When the Gufstream shuts down Ice Ages begin The reason the Gulfstream current shuts down is when excess fresh water runoff from Greenland and the St Lawrence Seaway enters the Atlanitc ocean it dilutes the salt content in the water There is a massive underwater water fall from the warm salty southern water hitting the lighter polar water located in the North Atlantic and this engine power every major ocean current in the world and when it dy Ice Ages begin in a little a 20 year The last Ice Age created 5000 foot Glaciers covering the US to a far south a Texas That is a big problem for the Elites because 80 of all economic output is generated in the higher latitude of the Northen Hemisphere The funny thing is the Elite Financial Interests when they started this human caused global warming Carbon Fraud never imagined that Ice Ages could start so quickly They had planned this fraud all the way back in the 1970 s to the 1990 s and at that time they selected carbon a the culprit for a Globalist Agenda to tax every man woman child and corporation on the planet So if you had a small carbon footprint you could sell your credit on the exchange But Wood s Hole Oceanographic discovered in the late 90 s through deep sea core sample that once the Gulfstream slowed Ice Ages begin in a little a 20 year Meanwhile they Chemtrail spray the atmosphere to cool it down by 1 by reflecting incoming sunlight back into space but let me tell you the horse ha left the barn and they know it They are still spraying Chemtrails for weather modification and weaponized application but here is the deal if you are speaking of carbom a being a pollutant you have not done the research and are hopelessly ignorant of the truth FYI crop yeilds and native plant growth is shattering all record because of the increased C02 level because when carbon mix with water you get sugar and that is plant food We are experiencing an abundance of plant growth due to increased level of C02 even a modest a it is but this is not the cause of planetary warming noor is it a threat since C02 s make up le than 04 of all greehouse gas Say what you want and with all due respect the Left have not done even the slightest bit of research into this mass mind controlled topic and arre simply regurgitating the talking point of the Financial Interests which by the way is the war machine the Wall Street parasite that live off of human misery war famine and disease C02 make up 0 04 percent The Earth s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other gas including about 0 04 percent carbon dioxide And yes Earth s CO2 concentration stood at 400 part per million in May 2015
