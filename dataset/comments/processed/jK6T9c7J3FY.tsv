Gio_Falcone	That's a great news!
trancehi	I read that after Brexit, we English will obviously have a new passport and thus, we will be fast tracked through border controls here over Europeans, however, the article stated that the Japanese will also be in the same queue as us along with Americans, Canadians and Australians. All those countries are welcome here, as far as I'm concerned.

Patrick Moon	Sledge , Thatcher , Mute and Smoke collab with Hibana and Echo. R6 siege baby !!
Jeff Song	The Japanese attempt to relaxing the legal restrictions and the subsequent military buildup is actually supervised by the US who wants Japan to take a proactive role in counterbalancing the rise of China in the decades to come.  The threat of North Korea is a convenient element for Japan to divert the unnecessary attention and the backlash from China for doing what Japan is doing.  North Korea, as much as the conventional media wants to paint it as a significant threat, do not stand for any chance of survival had the war broken out.  If you are building your muscle to beat up the biggest boy in the playground, you don't want him to think that.  Instead, you pick on the little guy and say "That little guy bucks the hell out of me,  not you big guy!"  A classic maneuver I'd say.

Harry	Tell me why does the British army have its policy directed by the Muslim council of Britain? isn't there supposed to be a separation of State and Mosque? You take soldiers to lands to be killed arguably to assist in establishing democracies in the Middle East and again, hypothetically, to dethrone theocratic despots and then you throw a British man  with no other disciplinary problems out of the army because he took a photo with someone whose politics you don't agree with...tell me again why the Muslim council of Britain dictates UK army policy in a secular state? The same UK Muslim council which the government disassociated itself from in 2009 for its extremist views. Sick

Edgy Cat	Banzaiiiiiiiiii
Sezar Dd	It seems to me that the time has come for the United States to pull out of Japan and let Japan decide for itself. I think we all know that the greatest danger to any country is the United States itself. Why ? Because America is always thinking of its own interests, rather than the rest.

Steeljaw XXI	This is a really good thing. Both the UK and Japan suffer from the same restriction of them being small Island power-houses. While the threats they face will be different, I feel some of the strategies, techniques, and technologies that work for one will work for the other. As neither can amass million personnel armies nor can they supply them for long, having shared and proven tactics for protection will be key for their survival, IMHO.  Not saying both nations need armed forces great enough to become invasive elements to their neighbors, but increasing their defenses against growing threats is not a bad thing.
Dueng Design	The 2 countries where cars driven on the left side. LOL
cheowyong lee	british have forgotten how the japanese defeated them!!!
Eric Mowrey	North Korea could have a military four times the size of Japan but until it has a viable, blue water navy North Korea remains an empty threat. China is the real threat, with ever growing power projection capabilities, including the ever expanding amphibious attack vessel fleet.  If China manages to build two additional aircraft carriers it may signal the beginning of serious concerns.

Tyynymyy	North-Korea attacking Japan? What a joke, they barely have the means to defend themselves without nuclear missiles. It doesn't matter if the army has googolplex soldiers if they can't be supplied effectively and lack the offensive capabilities. In it's current state North-Korea is not a military threat to anyone at least when it comes to traditional warfare.
ArchesBro	Japanese people dont know English other than the little grammar they learned in school, why not use a translator because clearly they are having a hard time responding
Michael Jon	Thanks you United Kingdom!   Japanese people would like to build a more effective relationship is thought.                         🇬🇧♡🇯🇵
Jadran Ahlstrom	Japan's first treaty with a foreign power, on equal alliance terms, was in 1902 with England in the Anglo-Japanese alliance. It really helped solidify Japan's reputation as a power and it showed the world that Japan joined the world stage and is here to stay. This alliance helped improve the Japanese navy until it became 3rd largest in world by 1920 and also win the 1904-1905 war vs. Russia. The alliance soured during the Versailles peace round and eventually the two nations were on opposite sides in the second world war. Long may the friendship last, old vengeances never forgotten but never allowing them to tie us down in the name of progress.

Julian Cate	22 minutes to talk about 50 British troops who trained a bit in Japan. The idea that this needs a mini-documentary is laughable, but even more laughable is the British military. Not only does the UK lack the will to go to war - regardless of party in charge - but lacks the ability to project military power beyond the white cliffs.

Captain Right	Yo Japanese soldiers. I know Japanese are an endangered species. With 40% of your population self reporting that they have never dated and about a 3rd having no interest in sex atall. If you want to save your country, you'd better start breeding as much and as fast as you can. A fertility rate of 1.4 is sad. In ww2 America dropped 2 nukes on you because of your uniformity in making a harmfull decision. Now you are nuking yourself in population because of the same uniformity.
Bhum Brahmavira	For you concerned Japanese out there, don't be.   I'm rather certain that 1: colonialism is dead in the Imperial family, and 2: us Gorkhali drove the point home in 1944.  Be more worried about Xi and his greasy fingers groping the South China Sea.  What youse ought to do on your part, is bitch slap some sense into the vocal fascist minority. Accept your past mistakes and allow open discussion. That's the only way to prevent this fuck up from repeating itself. Shit, we fucked up too. The turn of the millenia wasn't to pretty in Nepal to say the least.  Oh well, just as youse are always so willing to throw money at us for our infrastructure, many individuals here are also always willing to "persuade" a few ultranationalists in your crib. Hey, you scratched our back as soon as you got off your arse. I'm certain many "retirees" in Nepal is more than happy to scratch your ultranationalist ulcer with a metaphorical lance...

Clutch	One thing that was missed when the USAF Col. answered "Why does the US have a presence here?" is the fact that the JSDF was never designed to stand alone. From the beginning it was designed to be a defensive buffer to last long enough for US/coalition forces to relieve them.

Manu De Man	about those nukes the people killed were mostly women, children and old people as the men were off fighting the effectiveness was limited as the mostly wooden Japanese cities had been fire bombed already many generals at the time openly challenged the need to use such a weapon and the end of the war shortly after had more to do with the Russians about to invade Japan than the nukes being dropped; or maybe the nukes were used because Russia was about to invade
Shawn.Kim	STILL no single apologies to those countries suffered from innocent civilian rapes, Slaughters during WW II. Instead, Those apes are building AAS, Marine corps which clearly is a system made for invasion. Who knows? They could hit your 6 just like the old days. LOL.  Training with them just to make china calm? Funny joke out there :) You pals should’ve done it with ROK. Not with those trying to break their leashes, dreaming their old empire bull s***.
rainbowsixODST	British Army? What army? All I saw was a bunch of demoralized soldiers forced to serve a Leftish System who cares nothing for them and who can’t even utilize the freedoms they defend. Japan’s soldiers are more free and open than Britain’s! I support soldierX

Kelvin Fong	Britain helped build the imperial Japanese navy. It’s earliest battleships were built in England.   Many Japanese naval officers were trained in England. Their greatest admiral, Togo was trained at Dartmouth.
Jackson Brown	The army blabs on about standing up against fascists, then decides to expel someone because they express their opinion...irony.

Templar Knight	The MOD are DESTROYING our British armed forces with political correctness. Allowing " crack " dealing soldiers to remain in the army while dismissing those who have the temerity to take a photo with a journalist who is anti Islamic just shows the type of people who are in charge as vile.
wcatholic1	The Germans have already altered their constitution in order to allow the Bundeswehr to operate beyond German borders, for example in ISAF. The Germans have accepted their role as a major regional power and Japan seems to be doing the same.
John Tressine	WOW, sending half our front-line troops just for a photo opp, we will soon be back in the big league.
StandSure	Quite interesting to see this, not many people know but the British actually freed the Japanese POWs after the war, armed them and worked with them to help maintain order in Vietnam and other parts of Asia, we've worked with them ever since.
chris1117F	Big deal you grits send three ships a few planes 16 soldiers and one helicopter. That's supposed to be a valuable asset show of force. U.s. has entire 7th fleet in Japan with a full carrier wing and three assualt carriers and a nuclear powered. Carrier and 100 fighter aircraft. And 50,000 army and marines in Japan. Grow up Britain you're not a global power.

Toffee Abroad	I'm surprised the MOD had enough money to fly the British soldiers to Japan. I was in a taxi last year in Singapore and the driver had not long finished his national service. He told me that he had spent a few weeks in the UK on a joint training exercise between the British Army and the Singapore Armed Forces. The exercise was originally supposed to take place in Singapore but the British couldn't afford to send their troops or equipment over.

dennytenny	Your Brits, we're keeping an eye on you.  If you and your pal the Japanese are planning to invade North Korea, you better think again.  The USA is ready to defend North Korea against all foreign liberal fascists incursions.  Trump will not allow his best friend Kim to be replaced by liberal fascist South Korean government.
mtnmist1	Amend the constitution so the Japanese can militarize.  What could possibly go wrong?
SixSixteen Sevens	Do they get a Hari-Kiri knife?
John Ashtone	Could people please remember it is 70+ years since WWII.  When I was at school a friend's father had been in Burma, he still had nightmares 25 years after, I have never forgotten this.  But times move on, the people today are not their parents or grand-parents, it is not they we are dealing with.  And it is how they behave in the modern world, and not admitting Muslims who wish to blow them up is hardly a sin?    In Afghanistan, they were superb, they were there just doing, none military jobs and back up, but still did everything, to the best Japanese standards and reliability, that you would expect from their electronics and cars?  We are natural allies and were until 1941, and those saying 3 ships and 150 soldiers is nothing, are just showing how silly they are.  No other Nation is as highly regarded by the Japanese, those saying UK is finished and broke are stupid, UK has 5th largest economy, and if we are so broke and finished why are so many people from other Nations so desperate to live here?   But hey who did let that flag fly as a distress signal at 13:46 lol

Wtf? Let them get the new replacement to do the dirty work stop brits dying for these muppets! See how that goes!.....
HDaviator	The Japanese should be careful, the PC could rub off on them. Don't want that.
BulletproofKam	They didn't include the uk reserves! 35,000 active reserves and over 160,000 ex millitary contracted reserves! They included them in the other nations  figures!... Britain has 210,000 millitary personel they could deploy anywere on earth anytime, and the other 160,000+ millitary personel they can call back up if needed....... get your figures right! And the Active Uzk reserves if 35,000 are just as well trained as normal soldiers..l
Phil Staples	Didn't we build them loads of warships and effectively train their navy, then later as a thank you they starved, tortured and worked to death loads of our and our allies soldiers? I can't remember them ever saying sorry for their terrible actions either....
mitsuru yamashita	To make things absolutely clear, this kind of relation has made almost for China, not North Korea. China is the only one country who has enough power to scare U.K. who is obviously trying to growth some power themselves in Asia, and China is threatening (or doing regular imperial stuff I say) all over the pacific.  U.K. Is also having relation with India (kinda, though.) to being "British" in Asia just like classic British.  So this seems like big movement but actually is, just Japan and U.K. both are pretty scared of China and trying to scare them as well as possible.   To cut a long story short, nothing has been changed so far, now both islands countries having a macho friend who were acutely good friends from long time ago.
