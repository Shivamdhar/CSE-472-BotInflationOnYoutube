Noot Noot	Okok this is really cool but Justin hasn't been on the news recently, like idk about you but me not being a fan I haven't heard about him since he released a despacito remake or whatever, so you doing this, making this controversy brought his name a fresh and relatable face, like he's casually just eating a burrito and that too in a weird way, I'm pretty sure he benefited a lot from this, also the memes must've been good for him too

Spazem	I admire the way you guys were able to get something viral so quickly and I think it was great work. I mean no offense to anybody by this but I really think this needs to be said. (None of this is directed at Yes Theory, it is directed to everybody)  The fact that SO many people deemed it necessary to share this, to the point of where it made it on the news really shows us where this world is headed. It's time people started waking up and snapping back to reality because if you're giving up your own time to share pictures of a famous person eating food (regardless of how they eat it, regardless of what they're doing for that matter) then your head isn't screwed on right.  If you can't find something better to do with your time besides sharing pictures of people eating food, all hope is lost for you.  That being said, the news on television these days has become complete garbage. The fact this went viral and made it on the news is clear evidence of how they're trying to brainwash you. Is it really that fucking important to show a picture of Justin Bieber eating a burrito over whats really going on in the world?  All media needs to be wiped clean, we've come to the point where our minds are no different from a fish.

There's no human face to face interaction and we know EVERYTHING but FEEL NOTHING.  Sad but true.  The internet is a black cesspool of humanity's worst impulses, and in it, celebrity rules.  Theater of the absurd.
Jon the King	The problem with the media - Did they ever contact Bieber asking if it was him? Nope, we just like to gossip.

Xpert Killler	Biggest social media prank of 2018
Violent Genius	This video goes to show just how easily people are fooled, not only that; but the lack of research media outlets and blogging websites are willing to put in. These are the people we trust with OUR news. Justin Bieber eating a burrito sideways.. hardly news but still manages to captivate peoples minds and have them go crazy over it. Sickening shit.
DiamondYT	Justin Y isn’t here. Finally.

Austin Senger	im retarded!
Rene Rosè	Yes theory you are on my bucket list... a bucket list I gave up on because of anxiety and depression. I live in a town where the murder rates grow every year and the ones murdering are usually always under the age of 20. I started to believe that I was going to end up a statistic or a casualty and maybe even both, but watching your videos and hearing your stories made me one get the feels and two inspired to make a bucket list and actually follow through with it. I always wanted to start my own YouTube channel and I put that on the top of my list. I’m struggling to think of an introductory video where I can show everyone who I am and what I want to accomplish on this platform. I’m constantly inspired just by watching your videos but I put meeting you all on my bucket list to hopefully one day get to sit down and get some genuine advice about YouTube and life in general! Law of attraction says that this WILL happen in my life time. So with all that said this guy from small town Oxnard California plans to make his dreams come true and no longer hold himself back because of where he’s from and you dudes and your videos have brought so much joy to me and the whole meaning of YES THEORY itself /alone helped kickstart a whole new way of thinking for not just me but so many others , keep doing what ya doing and continue to make dope ass content, good bye for now boys 🙏🏻

Isn't it like "Media only care about useless things and don't see the good sides of the world" ? Oh we alraedy knew it, and to the people saying that bad journalism is only in America, no it isn't, I've seen French journal's and it is just sooo horrible and so full of fake news, even i with a simple research on Wikipedia have found the truth, but people don't take the time to do it themselves, they just absorb what they are given and this is the real danger of this world, this is separating us and making our lives worst.

๖ۣۜǤнσsτly ๖ۣۜDesigns༻	0:16 *If you're not offended you're not American*  So burritos aren't from Mexico? If I'm right, the Diccionario de Mexicanismos has an entry for the burrito as early as 1895. The entry states that a burrito is "A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called 'coçito' in Yucatán and 'taco' in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City."

I assuming the difference is that the people that support Trump are thinkers and truth seekers.. they hear something on the news and they look into to see if there is truth to the claims... while others just take what sounds good hook, line and sinker even to their own demise.   It is sad to look at anyone under the spell of deception....  this is true in religion and now politics.....  PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO AND LEARN ABOUT THE FACTS...  TRUMP HAS DONE AND WILL DO MORE FOR YOU THAN OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS.    THIS VIDEO WILL SHOCK YOU @p0zk

So people on the internet stop believing everything n stop trolling celebs coz everything you see on internet is not true.. it makes me sooo mad that people just blindly believe everything they see or hear.. without even thinking.. celebs' life are far more complicated thn us guys.. we can do any mistake n get out from it.. bt if they do the same simple mistake they are judged by whole world coz they have cameras eveywhere.. so please don't always believe what you see or hear.. this video is a good example of that.. it did convey that message that no one should believe everything they see..

jad fakhoury	(PLEASE READ, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)   Hey Yes Theory,   My name is Jad Fakhoury, I’m 15 years, in grade 10 and I live in Ottawa. I’ve always have  had a passion for helping those around me. So In school, I took a course called “Leadership”. I am always open to new opportunities and always trying my best to test my discomfort in many ways!! In my leadership class, my summative is to do an initiative that will help those around me and make a change in the community. I’ve been watching your videos since early 2016 and you guys have always wanted to make a change in the world which personally inspired me to do the same ever since!! If it’s possible, I was hoping if you guys can come to Ottawa and help me make an initiative idea that spread and influence positive change in my community and hopefully my city!! This goes far beyond my summative, this allows the community to connect together as one and help inspire those around us to make the world a better place. I know this is a long shot and you probably won’t see it, but everyone has to try and start somewhere. Please think about it, thank you so much.

WingMik	He’s Canadian too. 🇨🇦
Fructoze Productions	The sad thing is just the fact that the Media even cares about how a celebrity is eating a certain kind of food to begin with. It's actually pathetic that millions of people care these peoples lives so much that is has to be spread around the world. I suggest everyone focus on themselves and stop following and focusing on "rich" "famous people" and obsessing about every little thing about someone elses life.

Nekkie Feathers	This is such a normal prank. No 'I ruined the life of a star' or something like that, but a random fake picture. Kudos ❤❤
Gumis PwS	I have trust issues now, its easier to fake a video with news and stuff then get things go that viral :D
Ayanna	LOL!!! This was such a fun video! 🤣🤣 And whoever edits props cuz it’s bomb! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Zoe Allen	Holy shitttt
BoilerBoise	Glad you guys faked the picture. I think people would have gone ape shit if someone Justin actually ate a burrito like that... LOL

FortyFourFitness	This is why I do not watch the news. 1. You can build fake stories and literally control peoples thoughts. 2. They seriously used production costs and time to talk about a guy eating a burrito sideways. These guys who did this at Yes Theory hopefully opened the eyes for a lot of people. Also, just think of all the people who started eating burritos sideways after they saw the picture...
Stick Crual	This is the definition of fake news. Now switch Justin with Trump. No wonder Trump calls fake news the enemy of the people.

Shevah Samuel	Following my comment below (which I still stand by), on the flip side, I saw an interview (Zach Sang Show) where Matt (on the phone) says no one except Vanity Fair (which you see on the Yes Theory video) actually bothers to not only check the facts but actually asks permission to use the photo (which I think is another important point). I’m glad that Yes Theory contacted Bieber’s manager to tell him (although he already knew it was them) and that he was down with it and he decided to even played along with the prank. I guess it is like Matt said, Justin, being that famous is (unfortunately) used to the media talking about every little thing he does (or in this case does not do). ....As long as we all learn something (positive) and are all (trying) just a little bit to be a better human being at the end of the day, that is what is important.

Djordje Maksimovic	Why people take something like eating the burito and make a big thing out of it just because he was eating it from the side i know this is fake but still it's stupid that things like this get viral.

Ethanent	To those saying that BBC and related news companies were wrong for publishing this: There's honestly nothing wrong with what the "mainstream" news companies were doing. They did their due diligence - there was no way for them to efficiently verify the truthfulness of the story other than to just ask the original poster about it. Also, I'm sure they understood that the story wasn't of critical importance and so didn't invest as much in the fact check process, which is just as well.
