The Last And First Time	Until the latest of our world conflict the United States had no armament industry American maker of plowshare could with time and a required make sword a well But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense We have been compelled to create a permanent armament industry of vast proportion Added to this three and a half million men and woman are directly engaged in the defense establishment We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporation Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arm industry is new in the American experience The total influence‚Äîeconomic political even spiritual‚Äîis felt in every city every Statehouse every office of the Federal government We recognize the imperative need for this development Yet we must not fail to comprehend it grave implication Our toil resource and livelihood are all involved So is the very structure of our society In the council of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberty or democratic process We should take nothing for granted Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful method and goal so that security and liberty may prosper together Dwight D Eisenhower http www youtube com watch v OyBNmecVtdU
