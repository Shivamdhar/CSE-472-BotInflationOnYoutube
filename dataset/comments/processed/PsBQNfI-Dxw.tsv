Nicholas Blackwell	9 7 unemployment and slow to negative growth wa the result of the republican caused great recession Unemployment wa 4 7 when Obama left and the GDP today isn t far off from Obama s GDP No one can look at an economic chart and see where Trump improved any trend We can see however where thing have slowed or gotten worse such a the US dollar value inflation wage stagnation etc There s a reason the piece used one number from 2010 and ignores all other fact

Anonymous Near Seattle	Okay so the economy is getting better Yay I actually hadn t noticed For me the economy is important but it s not the biggest issue We could have the best economy in the world but this country is still failing Even if we all have job so what We re still miserable Do the leader of this country really believe that all we need to be happy is work Wow I can t wait to spend the next 30 year working Because work brings SOOOOO much satisfaction to my life Ugh I still support Trump but I need him to WAKE UP We only work because we have to And I m even okay with this arrangement a long a I m getting what I want in return What I want is what most men want We want gender relation repaired We want healthy pair bonding to be available to u We want the option of getting married and having kid without the fear of being divorce raped If men and woman don t trust each other and can t won t have child with each other then we don t have a country no matter how good the economy is The first step in this direction is repealing no fault divorce law With what do we replace them you ask Well a little common sense would go a long way here If someone voluntarily walk away from a job no one expects the ex employer to continue paying someone s previous salary just because someone wa accustomed to a quality of life supported by that income Similarly if a wife leaf her husband for no reason other than she think she can get a better deal somewhere else my sister is in the process of leaving her husband for this reason right now then she should not receive alimony and her cut of the shared asset should be substantially reduced What if the husband is the bread winner and he decides he want out of the marriage so he can go bang someone else Well then it s his fault and he should be required to pay alimony for a reasonable amount of time What if the divorce really is no one s fault and they both want out In that case divide the asset evenly but if no one s at fault then alimony can t be awarded Alimony is a punishment and denotes fault in a divorce And what about the child you ask In true no fault case custody should also be evenly split If it s 50 50 then why would anyone be paying child support What if fault is determined Again common sense should be applied Assuming there s no danger to the child whichever spouse is most financially capable of taking care of the child should get majority custody of the child Does this mean that the husband if he wa the bread winner will always get custody Not necessarily especially if he wa found at fault for the divorce In that case he s paying alimony Does paying alimony mean he s still financially capable of caring for the child Maybe not In this way husband AND wife are now incentivized to make the marriage work The nuclear family is THE cornerstone of civilization If we don t FIX this problem men WILL walk away from the economy Then what wa the point in putting all this effort into the economy There won t even be a country

Dan Preston	This is ridiculous The high unemployment rate of 9 7 shown in the video date back to 2010 the result of the economic crash that Republican George Bush brought u in 2007 2008 President Obama wa able to bring that down 5 point to 4 7 by the end of his term Okay so that momentum ha continued and dropped another point to 3 7 during Trump s first 22 month in office In sum Obama deserves credit for 5 6 of the drop in unemployment the video discus So I agree that we shouldn t go back to the failed policy of the Bush year but that s hardly an argument for Trump It s mainly an argument to bring back Obama

beccabunny09	The recession happened on republican watch inflamed by Alan Greenspan s gullible faith in the market like banker were going to hold back from bad investment when it wasn t their money they were risking and made worse by congressional republican s sudden and intense belief that the debt which they had ran up spending on two foreign war and tax cut for the rich wa now way to high and borrowing money to help put unemployed Americans back to work rather then enriching Halliburton wa the most unethical thing that could possibly be imagined Why vote for the party that put u into the recession in the first place
