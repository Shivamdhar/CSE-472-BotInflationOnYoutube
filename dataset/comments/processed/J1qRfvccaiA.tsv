TYPCL FANGIRL	As an INSPIRIT to be honest when Hoya is still in INFINITE he was so good and its just a pity he left the group. But we all know that he did it for his dream. His dream that everyone will know him because he is Hoya. Just Hoya. And I'm so happy seeing comments that praise him because it felt like I, as his fan, then and now, accomplished something. Thank you for supporting him and making his dreams come true.  HOYA FIGHTING! WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT!

mary lu	I'm happy to see Hoya in tears not because I want him to cry but because it showed his joy. I'm not gonna lie, I miss him as part of Infinite. But I'm still cheering for you Howon-ah! I hope you'll achieve all the dreams you have. Fighting! 💕

Jooheon’s Dimples	*OF COURSE NOW IM CRYING SEEING HOW BIG MY BABY JISUNG HAVE GROWN UP*
jisung's lollipop in go	imma be honest Hoya Team's performances are always my favorite. Not because Jisung's a member of it but because they're actually really good and  Hoya is one hell of a great coach. I mean J-Black seems to agree with me on this since he always gives them real high scores and compliments
Puff Daddy	Dammit, Howon, even if you can’t keep Jisung at least take the rest of your kids and make a permanent team. It’s been years since I’ve seen you as happy as they made you. It’s okay to want to rely on people being there. You don’t have to be lonely even if you’re promoting alone.
M Y S T R AY T W I C E H E A R T	Jisuuuuuuuung😵😍😍😍
Marcus Lee	Despite of his age, he's able to do what he desired to.. Jisung is really a Maknae-on-top! He gains friends as what he wanted to. Surely, we're proud of him, even his hyungs and family. His age, their group promotions, and his past health issue(s).. is he really a 16-year old? And Hoya is so proud backstage.. 😫 They're really amazing. As if what J-Black said, they were like a real team felt through their expressions and emotions. Daebak!  Anyways, thanks for reading 😄 Muahugs🤗
Thuong Lan	jisung
TheDreamcatcher6	This is a really great song 💗 Thank you Hoya for being an amazing coach to your kids 😭
Marie G	There are so many points in this choreography that blew my mind. It's so beautiful 😍
jennie kim	proud girlfriend here!!! 😍
Yantri Purnama	They got their own song, their own choreography, I hope they can make their music video for that song with Hoya sings on it. Cause I knew that this group won't be exist, remembering Ji Sung has a group already. By the way, I supported this group for the first time, not just because it was Hoya's, but I love each of them. So sad that they didn't win it, but you guys won our hearts ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

GRASSZEN MONBEBE	I got goosebumps while watching this
Pang Pond	Perfect jisung😍
cnb139	This is why I will have nothing to do with the American music industry anymore. Our expectations and standards are so low, and we are so far behind. It's just sad. I don't really understand what America is doing right now, and why we are not AT LEAST TRYING to keep up with the Asian music industry. Nothing about American music (whether it's dancing, singing, rapping, etc.) impresses me anymore now that I've discovered, through K-pop of all things (I never would have imagined.), the TRUE potential of how music is really supposed to be.
Camryn Lee	They're all so talented and I love them to death
Nubvagant vibes	Jisung looks like a angel

Hyunjins dimple	i just got goosebumps
Sephora Marroquin	When I was watching the performance the 1st time I felt so emotional I started to cry. Then I came here and watched this and i started to cry all over again. Both the song and choreography goes together so well. Hoya’s been through so much to have them complement this.😍😍😍😍🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼  Also the team themselves is amazing! The way they moved and the way they put their emotions in their dancing! 👌🏼👌🏼 #teamhoya
Luma Lovegood;;땡	THEY WERE THE BEST TEAM.
sebaek kill me with their bubble butt	Ok but i need to dload this bop song!!!
Samantha Punzalan	Can someone tell me the story of team Hoya? I’m late to Dancing High but I saw who I assume is Hoya crying at the end? And the dance was so gorgeous and I’m...

Samjhana Ranamgr	Who is the tall guy
Ara Hermosa	Gosh BEST TEAM EVERRRR!!!
Stefanny Mandagi	There's Woo Jin, judging to NCT Jisung dancing 😅😅 Jisung literally is his seonbae 😄😆 hehehehehehehe...
Florence Senora	Even before the dance was finished I just can't stop crying because of their performance. You can feel by their dancing how much each of them means to each other. I love their teamwork. These kids will go a long way and have found not only a mentor and co-dancers but a family. While watching the performance I can't stop thinking of my dance family also, and I can relate to what they are feeling in that moment. Kudos to them and especially HOYA who really made this team as one.
Lazy Weirdo	Do I see a Jisung Pwark here?

Karlee Hideko	Where can I download this song? The performance and song is so great!!!
Sarah Dita	Wahhh jinja this song and dance is perfect, good job yorobeun  . . .  .
Simran Wilasra	As any Infinite fan might say, Hoya is not one to cry easily. He's always tried to be the strongest person, but to see these kids bring him to tears says just how important this show was for him. This performance was beautiful, with the right amount of emotions and the right amount of restraint, and I would love to see at least an video of them performing this released because this performance deserves to be seen by the world.
Rona Balarido	"Now you can cry" Me : **cries in a corner**
Seewhyareey ken	Awww~ I feel how proud Hoya to the kids 💙
Red VelBaek	I got goose bumps! They are so good! 😍 and jisungie you did great sweetie 😚💚
Ice-cream Nyam Nyam	Guys here's an idea, Most of us want studio version of the song but Hoya said he has no intention of releasing it as it's exclusively for his team but also said he might think about it. How about we ask him and his members on Instagram to upload this amazing song? If they see how many people want it, hoya might actually release it. He can even release on his personal YouTube channel REAL HOYA.   Hoya's Instagram : @isayhousayya  Team : @se_hyun_hrdi @park_jh_214 @eunmin_003 @lil1aw @7dong_h.k @smith_break_bboy
IM YHUMI	Is this the final episode? Did the NCT member watch it like what they promise to jisung?
Elon Fixley	I dont know why but I really love Hoya team not because Jisung but I think their team dance for something related to I dont know who but seriously I really like them..BTW Jisung made NCTzens proud of him..

atha91	Now i know why SM "loves" KBS so much!! They never make such evil editing to Jisung.. They even made Jisung as the thumbnails for almost all Team Hoya's video..  That's why SM also only upload all MuBank stage to their official channel..  I love this lovely relationship between KBS and SM!!

ting tongie	I really love Hoya as a coach. He really puts all of his emotions into all the performances he makes for the kids. I mean using such sentimental songs and his own. Let’s not forget New Rules where he recorded parts. He seems to be bounded to the kids really. And although they didn’t win, they still did an amazing job all throughout the entire show!! So proud of them nonetheless. 💚

DANCING 💯 as always, they killed it~ but really, I really loved their final performance, them dancing to Hoya's amazing self-composed song is just the coolest ever, they're just the B.E.S.T 👍👏 Hoya is such an amazing coach, you can really tell how much he cares for his team, even if they aren't the final winner, they are the definitely the one who won in my heart, but ofcourse~ all teams definitely SLAYED 💞  *PS: Such a shame~ that Dancing High ended already, all the teens are really talented AF*

abc	uwu
Sydney	Im so proud of this entire team. They're all so passionate and to create such a strong bond in such a short period of time shows their dedication
Ainul Aiman	I came here to see how amazing Hoya has become as a solo artist and this performance just makes me so proud of him. However, as an Inspirit, I can't help to relate to the song at that moment of his departure from his former group Infinite and I'm now brimming with tears. I'm rather accepting when it comes to individuals who after some time debuting with their groups, decided to leave but I will quietly cry by myself after noticing the void they have left. Hoya's void is impactful because as a fan of his once upon a time, I knew he was and will always be this good.  All the best Hoya. Hwaiting! Love you.
Kerry Ann Gorero	Hoya team you made us cry of happiness amazing song and performance in our hearts your the winning team😘😘😘
Definitely Definite	This group is versatile. They didn't stick to certain genre. They tried some genre, hiphop, contemporary, etc. Nobody in this team has speciality in contemporary, but they dared to try it. If this program has more episode, maybe they will try doing ballet lol
el kimme	when did jisung become this hawt
amethyst	When the concept, dance, and music be in one package and touched your soul. It means they're success. Yess. I was moved. This touched me so much, Thank you Hoya and the Team.
