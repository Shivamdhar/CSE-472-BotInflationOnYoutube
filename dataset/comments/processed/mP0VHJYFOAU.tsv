Newsha Arezi	***should you watch "Bohemian rhapsody"? ***  Absolutely YES, if you are a fan of rock music and have  lived your life listening to legendary rock songs of Queen...  or if you are not a fan of rock, but you are a fan of music, a fan of experiencing the magic of live music, the power of voices of thousands people singing along to a song...  or if you were born before 1970, and remember the remarkable day of July 13th 1985 and how it impacted the world, the live aid and the donations...  or if you are like me,  born after 1985, but be willing  to give up even one year of your life just to be present at that stadium on that historic day, at that exact time, to be a part of one of the most memorable live performances in the history...   or if you are into good movies, no no, amazing movies, breathtaking movies.. with ups and lows and a perfect balance of sarcasm, excitement and emotion...   To sum up, you SHOULD watch this movie if you are a living human being... if you can hear, or see, or read this, you should watch it and let me promise you, you will not regret it!   and once you watch it, you will come back, like this comment, and watch the movie again.

Kayleigh De Burca	Just back from seeing the film. I have a headache from trying not to burst out crying in the cinema. Spectacular film.
pheba100	Well the critics are right... No matter of what we like... The movie wasn't "there".... It was just a show for the fans... Playing 6-7 hits for fans to be ok... But Freddie was an icon. They didn't capture anything of his personality and his life.. Nor Queen's life...  I'm not dissapointed though... But the critics are on point for this one. I' ll not be surprised if this won't be nominated for less than 1 Oscar... And propably wont get it... (it's only for a leading actor)

Sandra	I just came back from the cinema, I will not able to fall asleep as I will be constantly thinking how great the movie was ! Long time I haven’t seen something good as this! I absolutely loved it.... LEGENDS! 💐
Alice Bejleri	What legend was Freddie. In the beginning, Sacha Cohen was nominated but there was no interest in them and they broke the conversation, then Ben Whishaw, who is a very good actress in fact. The troika trio tried to say that. Singer's first ruler was a pedophile, caught by every aspect has been dropped here. As far as Brian is concerned, I have a lot to say about him. He is expecting from a Brian who shows sensational things from Freddie's life as his sick leg and Freddie's suffering before dying and such like this before releasing a book of his own or being both ridiculed by John Deacon and put out a hard article about him in the English tabloids? Or for Brian in the 90s he said we can not continue without Freddie and now says that Adam had `range` higher than Freddie and Freddie would be jealous of her? while not forgetting to mechanically wail a Freddie video at any concert they do with Adam's goblet? Freddie's birthday and Freddie's birthday did not share her but the movie. Freddie's "Freddie to the bones on his expence." do now have a `significant timing 'and is disgusting as an idea. Brian is the first, Roger his doll. both without character. good musicians but people who have lost their character or themselves for fam and money. Who knows Freddie well just gets tired of all this. and he is laughing from above while saying: Oh f.ck them all darling;)
Jennifer Ly	im thinking about watching this, any reviews? without spoiling of course

Mikayla Strack	You know that feeling you get when that one movie makes you feel something, and moves you, that doesn’t happen with other ones? This is one of them. Amazing!
Game Fun	the legend Film ini menelusuri kisah dari kemunculan sebuah band yang meroket melalui lagu-lagu ikonik dan suara revolusioner mereka, perpecahan internal band karena gaya hidup Freddie yang makin tidak terkontrol, hingga reuni kemenangan mereka pada malam Live Aid, di mana Freddie, meski sedang menghadapi penyakit serius, memimpin band di salah satu pertunjukan terbesar dalam sejarah musik Rock. Film ini akan memperlihatkan warisan sebuah band yang selalu lebih seperti keluarga, dan yang terus menginspirasi pihak luar, para pemimpi dan pecinta musik hingga hari ini.  https://bioskopinfo.com/movie/bohemian-rhapsody-gik

Stanislav Fomin	Благодаря таким фильмам в очередной раз убеждаешься, что гении своего времени — все немного того… не от мира сего. И если их не запинали соседские дети, не бойкотировали одноклассники и не довело до полного морального уничтожение злое и беспощадное общество, то из таких людей с вероятностью в 99,9 выйдет гениальная, творческая личность. Вот как Меркьюри например. Манерный пакистанец-гей. И кто бы подумал, что такой — станет иконой для нескольких поколений.   Фильм получился стоящим, даже несмотря на некую скомканность. Но оно и понятно — невозможно вместить биографию культовой группы в каких-то два часа. Я не являюсь фанатом QUEEN, однако как и каждый человек, хоть немного претендующий на музыкальный вкус, признаю вклад группы в музыкальную историю, уважаю и когда-никогда грущу под «Show must go on». Поэтому многая информация в фильме для меня была в новинку — я не знала откуда стартанула группа, как развивалась; не знала Меркьюри так близко. Только поверхностные факты: мощный голос, усы, блёстки, гей…   Теперь знаю! И благодарна создателям за то, что познакомили с дивой по имени Фредди и всей его бригадой. Вот только даже для такого тёмного человека как я — история получилась слишком розовой. После просмотра, включив ost, я прочесала Интернет. Буквально пару статей, пару глав авторов-биографов Меркьюри и становится понятно — «Богемская рапсодия» фактически иконизирует Фредди, подчищает его историю и боготворит. Гораздо более грязной и запутанной была жизнь несомненного кумира миллионов. Так что фильм Брайана Сингера — это вовсе не дерзкое откровение, а этакая конфетка в ярком фантике: из биографии тут только прикрытые цензурой общеизвестные факты.   Но если отбросить все эти придирки и долгие размышления — «Богемская рапсодия» заходит на ура! Красочно, музыкально, душераздирающе… А чего только стоит последняя сцена — то самое выступление на Live Aid — культовое, кадры из которого видели даже нынешние пятилетки.   Невозможно не отметить работу кастинговых охотников — так подобрать персонажей, невероятно! Ловила себя на мысли, что вообще не воспринимаю всё происходящее как актерскую игру. Вот же они, передо мной — четверка QUEEN. Реми Малек — вообще отдельный персонаж. Несите ему Оскар, потому что не представляю сколько дней и ночей он провёл перед зеркалом, заучивая движения, мимику и повадки Меркьюри. Идеальное попадание. Пока что лучшая роль в его карьере, однозначно.  Самый яркий фильм широкого проката в этом году. Держит с первой минуты до последней секунды, а после не отпускает, заставляя прокручивать выступления настоящих QUEEN на ютюбе раз за разом, раз за разом…
Fondas Trop	Ese cabron se parece mas a Michael Jackson

ndugu77	A PHENOMENAL MOVIE!!!!!  I wasn't expecting much (as I was never a very big fan of Queen) but this thing was truly amazing! The last 15-20 minutes of them at the Live Aid concert at Wembly stadium was maybe better than any concert I've attended in person. If you go see this movie, see it in "XD"... as the sound system will blow you away!!!  A MUST-SEE movie that definitely should be seen on the big screen.  ENJOY!!!
Dog Gamer	''There's only room for one hysterical queen in this band''

Yo Maybabe	This shows us there really is beauty in tragedy. I’m not gonna sit here and say I was a fan of queen, but after watching the movie last night I really do appreciate Freddie and the band. He was so misunderstood just for his eccentric ways and his sexuality. Tbfh I would’ve loved to have been around while queen was in there prime. You are a legend Fred.

Matyas Zilai	No matter what point of view we are looking at this from… this movie is a very touching, very straightforward piece of art that gives us a a little idea about how Freddie, Brian, Roger and John became legends of known music history. Exceptionally recommended to all fans who admire the works of Queen. Also, casting department definitely deserve an Oscar, they could not have found anybody better for these roles…and don't worry, nothing shameful about having tears in your eyes, I had them, too. :)

Angelica Caselles	when the trailer itself is oscar worthy
Yessi Crumudh	i wanna cry 😭😭😭😭
nv vam	What I was pleasantly surprised to see in this movie was the accurate depiction of his PARSI INDIAN heritage.  No mention of him being "Persian" or Iranian.  For too long documentaries have neglected his heritage.  This should put this issue to rest.

CutZy McCall	Wow! Just saw it. One of the best rock biopics of all time. This is pure genius and I never wanted it to end. Tons of fabulous music. My two picks for leading actor/actress this year: Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury and Chloe Sevigny as Lizzie (Borden). Totally unique roles, perfectly imagined.
Its Juancho Yo	Ok. Now im waiting for a Johnny Cash or a Frank Sinatra movie. Hollywood, do your thing!

L A	Is it me or are there scenes that were not in the film? Ps : ps: I did not know much queen and I went to see the movie a bit random a few days ago and I loved it! The actor is awesome and deserves an Oscar for his performance, the film is really well done from beginning to end. A huge Bravo.
fanis firstpriest	I saw the movie yesterday. While watching I started feeling somehow surprised but in a negative way. At the end I was just disappointed. I was waiting for that movie a long time, as I am a Queen and Freddy fan as well. The movie goes really fast and it gives a sense of a non-refined plot. Real facts, all the fans around the world know, go upside down or even just omitted from the movie. Some examples. The way Freddie met Mary Austin seems like they had already know each other. And if I am not wrong Freddy was introduced to Mary (or vice versa) by Brian, something that is not shown in the movie. Another "wtf" thing is that the director shows a very early success of the group (before "A Night at the Opera year of 1975 which was the actual turning point forward to their success) by giving scenes of gigs with huge crowds even already being familiar with some of the bands then hits. A small detail: the song "Fat Bottomed Girls" is listened in the movie in the year of 1976 I think even if this was a Jazz album song, issued in 1979. Then the director suddenly jumps from 1976 to the moustache era of Freddy in 1980! No reference to the collaboration with David Bowie at all in making "Under Pressure" in 1981. No reference to the almost (but never) complete collaboration with Michael Jackson the same period. The top of the iceberg(the movie was indeed such a cold shower!) is that towards the end of the movie, little before the Live Aid performance there's a scene where Freddy calls the group back as they were dismissed after a rehearsal and tells them that he had AIDS!!! Absolute falsification of the truth. All the people being aware of Freddy's basic bio facts know that he didn't know of his HIV infection not earlier than the last 3-4 months of 1986. The fact that he may was concerned way longer about that doesn't change that fact and of course the fact that he didn't tell to anybody about his health issue before he was officially diagnosed. And a few days before Live Aid is way too far from that day. As an overall sense, despite the fact that the movie has some well-shooted scenes (especially the Live Aid reproduction) and Rami Malek plays his role pretty well (not perfect though in my opinion) at the end it's like the movie was targetting to a beginner of the whole Queen and F.M. story.
hay man	What season of Mr robot is this?
A Retarded Orange Ape In The White House	Rami Malek better be nominated for best male actor. Movie was amazing, go see it.
superdave31	Omg I just realised... the man playing John Deacon was the young boy in Jurassic Park! Knew I recognised his name from some where!
GuimeN	Freddie you are a legend... We all legends.

kroakie4	Rami Malek did a positively phenomenal job in his role as Freddie. So did the others. I think Freddie would be so flattered they did a movie about him and Queen. This better get some big awards.

I WANT IT ALL, guys!!! ... to be continued?!!)
ifiwasyermother	I just saw it. You know what? From a strictically technical point of view, Rami did a great job. I'll spare you the details, so I don't spoil it for you. But I will tell you this: remember the movie My week with Marilyn? Michelle Williams did a great job too. Just like in Rami's case, the make up, the mannerisms, the inflection, etc, everything was there. Well almost everything. There are certain people that had such presence and charisma that you just can't mimic that yo a T. You just can't. You either have it or you don't. You can do everything right, like Michelle and Rami, but I didnt see Marilyn then, and I don't see Freddie now. I see an extremely awesome performance, maybe even worthy of an Oscar, but you can never forget you're watching Michelle and Rami in those movies. You're watching actors play these legends. This is not necessarily bad, but just giving you heads up.
Jon Richardson	Okay wait... look at the end of the trailer! The crowd isn’t even doing the beat right in the shot. It’s not even just that the audio doesn’t match up... They are clapping twice and then stomping instead of stomping twice and then clapping!
Alexander D	This trailer made it seem like something else. But I loved the movie

T0tal Warri0r	just became a fan of Queen last year
Aaju Petersen	IM TOO EXCITED!!
Emerald GemOne	Saw it yesterday, it was historically and factually accurate. Rami Malek did a fantastic job playing Freddie Mercury. The movie also showed how the band got along during their creative process for their songs. It was more about their creative process in their songwriting, how they worked with each other.  Really good movie. I was surprised that they showed the bits in regards to Mary Austin in Mercury's life. I didn't think they'd show this. The music in the movie was great. I sat there and head banged all through the movie.
Samantha	wow there was a lot cut from the final product huh
Marina leon	Hace mucho no gozaba de una película como está, ayer la vi y la adore!! Lo que no habría dado por mirarlos en vivo ya todo color! Son magníficos y Freddy tenía un carisma que hacía a todos amarlo!

Arabian Miguel	Facts: Rami Malek is an Egyptian American ( ethnic Arab ) who plays an Ethnic Persian ( Freddy Mercury). Both men are Middle Eastern. How cool is that? Please America & the West, stop listening to Trump & Fox News cause all they do is lie & demonize other people like Arabs. The majority of Arabs & people from Middle East are good people just like you! Enjoy the movie & don’t forget to vote the hate out on Tuesday.  Thank you.

Maria Portela	Wow bruno mars is freddy...jajaja
TRIX PRANX	This movie really reminds me of straight out of Compton except the music genre everything else is pretty similar
HAPPIER EVER AFTER	I like this
Juan Sebastian Valencia Torres	There was a moment during the movie that I forgot I was watching Rami but there was Freddie instead. He deserves an Oscar.
CuteFairyCatFoxQueen (veroavia)	Best movie ever!
Günel Səlimova	You are legend Fred. We all are legends.
V. krmsmn	I loved this movie❤😍 you should watch it!
sc30002001	Some guy was shaking his head to we are the champions. Awesome movie Rami did it he made his career flourish.
Casper thedog3	Saw this movie. It was beautiful :)
Well Dun, Jøsh - Bøisterøus Hal	I just saw this film, and it is perfection. Go watch it. 👍
msinvincible2000	I seem to be the only person who was dissappointed with this film. The actors were absolutely AMAZING, but the editing was awful, especially the first half of the film. We were shown one scene which was then abruptly cut, and another scene started, with no connection whatsoever! And this continued throughout the first half!  My family who are not fan of Queen didn't understand what was going on, I had to explain everything after the film. It was so so bad! I remembered an interview of the great Milos Forman and imagined his reaction to this film: he would have been confused and appalled by the editing
OhSuzeyQ	Rami Malek ❤️
Driving_inMyHead	This movie was absolutely outstanding
John Smith	I only discovered queen and freddie about a month ago , where on earth was this hidden from me ??? , this has musically shaken me to the core , best singer and a band ever.
MegaDimon1980	Amazing film! Tears were in my eyes all the time!
MrReed314	Not once. Not ever, will I insult Freddie, or his memory, by going to see someone do a Karaoke Mime and cover of Freddie Mercury... Freddie was Freddie, 'nuff said'.
Kacey	I bet this movie is good.
Vogelkinder	Movie was really, really good.
SilentKnight43	In 54 years I've never been moved to tears in a movie theatre...until tonight.  But at the same time thrilled by the music and acting performances.  Simply a great movie all around.  Grew up with Queen's music and still vividly remember the sad day we lost Freddie.  Queen's music is timeless and will endure for generations.  In the theatre I saw a 8-10 yr old kid air guitar and air drum for the final 20 minutes of the film - and thought it was awesome to see a new generation enjoying the music so much.
raka marshall	elliot, this is just your imagination.
Shisir Koirala	Raise ur hand if anyone wants to have a kurt cobain movie next
Old subscriber	ACDC movie next please. Put it in this order ACDC then Nirvana then Linkin Park
Antonía Mist Gísladóttir	Growing up (I'm 15) I knew the Queen hits just like any other music. Recently I've been listening to Queen so much because of the movie coming. I knew I loved the music but when I saw the movie it broke me. Just seeing the story and behind the song was beautiful. I never really understood what Bohemian Rhapsody was about but now I do and it just makes me want to cry. The story, the sound, the lyrics all make me feel in a way that I've never felt before. This is truly the most amazing and heavy movie I've ever seen
Rick Scicluna	Wow! This film was fantastic! Yes I had tears in my eyes of happiness and sadness throughout. Well done! Acting was superb all around. Cinematography was brilliant! Go see it before it leaves the theatre!
Thegreatestman Toeverwlktheplanet	Snore

LonelyHui	I *loved* this movie
Phạm Trầm	music 0:40 ?
jaydel3	amazing movie.  Even if you are not a fan, the last scene will move you as it shows the human spirit intertwined with ppwerful music.  I wish we have more Real music from all genres again. Electronic music destroyed modern misic as kids now just want a bass drop instead of hypnotic melodies and vocals.
Daisy Jurado	This movie is so beautiful
Adena M	Phenomenal and powerful. So grateful
Feralgame 01	On ta la película de Punk an kid

temporarydive	Can anyone explain to me why Rami Malek does not wear dark contact lenses in this movie?
Sharon Santaella	This movie was amazing! Non stop singing yet this was not at all a musical. Great acting!!

Thomas Saunders	Just saw this movie it Rocks don't miss it !!
Bienvenido TV	I feel the essence of the message of this movie
MADLeon13	I remember seeing this trailer while before watching Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, Crazy Rich Asians and A Star is Born now I really can’t wait seeing it on big screen
Αγνωστος Αγνωστου	Rami in some parts of film looks more like Mick Jagger than Freddie Mercury...
Heartsmusic	I saw this movie yesterday and I loved it. Everybody should go and see it. It made me sad how his wife treated him after he told her he was bisexual. Love Of My Life is such a sweet song that he wrote for her. 😭
Bachir Mazaz	Just fantastic. Out of words
Always Save	The white people's Straight Outta Compton
wwwspb	What I really don't get HOW "A star is born" got a way better review score than Bohemian Rapsody? Malek's performance is OUTSTANDING! As a huge fan of Queen, I didn't have any moment of "fake" and the whole story was so about him, Freddy and you just love him even more, if that's even possible. While "a star is born" is like a beatufiul cover to an empty book (loved a few songs, really cool ones).
BBDGus	Bland acting from the guy playing Freddy, but that's too shallow of my part I have too see the movie . hope I'm totally wrong.
nura amelia	just saw this movie! best movie of 2018 and the upcoming years for sure. 💖
Rocio Tigre	Chills

hoe 4 bts	I’m seeing this tomorrow and I’m so excited my heart is POUNDING Edit: IT WAS SO GOOD I DIDNT WANT IT TO END
Luis Flores	It was a great film. Not an accurate representation of what really happened, which is why there was lots of bad reviews, but overall I thought it was a great film!
slynnc kitty	Adam Lambert has a cameo as the truck driver in the red baseball hat.  You can't even tell it's him. LOL
Mellowney Vallen	I've seen it in the cinema like just 2 hours ago  Please go see it Even if you don't really know that much about Queen (like me ^^') Definitely reccomend!!

Ben Smith	Am I the only one who thinks he looks more like Willy Wonka than Freddie Mercury?
Martin Major	I still think Sacha Baron Cohen would have made a more charismatic Freddie Mercury. Or maybe Rami Malek was not convincing at all by portraying an out of character introvert Freedie.
Carpenter Keeper	I watched it and it was great but I would’ve liked more songs in it but other than that it was a great movie and I think it deserves some Oscars 😃😃😃
Mr. Tuna Man	just watched the movie last night and it was totally worth the wait. such a beautiful movie.
Czaszka63	I hope there will be a Bohemion Rhapsody 2 :v
Wolfen443	Amazing performances by the cast specially Malik, I am myself not a great Queen Fan but even I cried in parts of the film. Did they performed the songs themselves for the film?, if they did they were amazing in the performances.

Lucky Gravity	I watched it earlier with my dad! I love it so much 😍 It made me laugh, feel excited and also cry ;-;
Lastkingof33	I reckon they are piggy backing on other musician movies like notorious and straight out of compton. Probably going to see more of these in the future.
Abu Hanifah	Just watched the movie, here's my own 2 cents: the storyline was a little bit... meh, i dunno, fast paced and out of place? I'd give it 7/10 tops :/  Malek's performance, however, earned a solid 10/10 from me. Nothing short of electrifying and bone shivering, especially with the live aid reenactment! (I hope i didn't give out any spoilers. Just trying my best to be completely unbiased here). There was absolutely no way that you could stop yourself from singing, clapping, and ee-yo-ing along inside the cinema. Overall it was gorgeous, heart thrilling, and nostalgic, for fans and non fans alike
Tomasz	For me he looks more like Mick Jagger. Only in some scenes he is similar to Freddie
Raffy Domingo	I've just watched this together with my family. Simple yet great flick and performances. I wouldn't be surprised if Malek wins an Oscar out of this.
Andrew Ward	Saw this last moth and cried. Launched sang. Sell out in Glasgow’s biggest cinema. Let’s see it get the credit it and Freddie deserves

layer j123	To be honest, I never knew about this movie until I saw the trailer today.
Timid Kitten	I LOVE QUEEN, but this film is DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING! It just didn't capture the magic of Queen or the spirit of the 1970's. Rami's portrayal of Freddie is more like a caricature of him (ultra exaggerated overbite and all), the other band members have no depth or nuance in character. Besides, the producers only used commercial hits such as We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, etc. which are certainly good, but what about their earlier output and lesser-known gems such as Seven Seas of Rhye, March of the Black Queen, The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke, Nevermore, Lily of the Valley, Ogre Battle etc.?

mrtonyo1965	Just saw it tonight at the movies.   A++.  Gonna be a huge hit
Tom Miano	In 1975, i was 16, and knew what "Queen's" meaning was. In highschool, everyone loved Queen, very few people understood what it meant. I did. And I didn't care. This was a great movie, very moving, it bought me back to the 70s, each song hit a cord in my heart. Freddie- There wasn't nor ever will be another  Freddie Mercury. We still love you.
Elle Meek	I love his chik o lits teeth!
Dulce Markel	Wow I just watched it and oh God it made me cry so much my teen daughter was all worried about me and started crying with me 😢. And she later told me "thank you mom now I know a little more about real music and now I know where all those songs come from". Now that made me one proud fan and mom 😉
Angel Heart	...... OMG!!! I LOVE YOU FREDDY MERCURY!!!!
yuyu yeyy	Today I watched it and it is the BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME I cried a lot because of the hype and the nostalgic memories with this amazing band ♥♥♥
ymmot elvis	To real Music Historians : Live AID 1985    ....Freddie told he had Aids in 1987  ......   But it makes a Good Story for American Fake News

Holly Trainer	Absolutely loved it!! I laughed, I sang, I smiled, I cried-I couldn’t ask for anything better!! Brian and Roger put their hearts and souls into this and it really shows. Rami had huge shoes to fill and he did a fantastic job!! I don’t care what the critics say/said and to the ones that felt they didn’t elaborate on his sexuality enough were blind!! It was thoroughly addressed and I appreciated that extra time used the way it was, to tell their story as QUEEN, and how they became the rock and roll sensations they are today!! There will never be another Freddie just as there will never be another band like QUEEN. Thank you for giving us this little bit of magic 💜💜💜💜
freedomisnocrime	i love how he  tells his cat  to STOP CRITICIZING HIM  AS " ANYONE CAN DO THAT" .
Nass Khan	Just saw the movie. Very entertaining & as good as you hope.  Forget cynical critics . They never saw Queen live I did .

Alexandre Lebiez	I can't explain ... I haven't words ... This movie was the best things I have ever seen ...
D. Yates	I am someone who rarely likes to go to the movies, but this one drug me out. I just saw this at an IMAX, I spent $15.00, and it was definitely money well spent! This better get an Oscar nod, or I wont even bother watching the Academy Awards.

Luca	One of the best movies I've seen!
Sarah Blackwell	EXCELLENT movie. That Live Aid scene alone was worth it. Every move, even where the Pepsi cups were was exact! Do not let the critics fool you, they had an expectation for a serious, dramatic, 'Philadelphia-esque' movie. While it has some of those points, this movies energy is entirely made to match the energy of that Live Aid bit. It is a colorful, and extremely fun eye/eargasm with a lot of good humour. Even my husband who dislikes Queen loved it. I would see it in IMAX if I were you.
Myk Regis	Fantastic movie ever!!!true to life story! Just watched it earlier in cinema here in phils..every detail of the movie is so so interesting..smiles in our faces then burst me into tears! Im so lucky to have witnessed this kind of true to life story ever!! Everyone applausing before the movie ended!!.. I can't move on! Great Band in their season! Perfect!!!!
this one	About time!  I never in my life felt I wanted to go to the movies, let along be waiting for a movie to hit the screens!
cricketbat09	Their back catalogue is amazing. Seven Seas of Rhye is an underrated classic. imho.
toto toto	Je suis aller voir le film il est génial
Kurniawati Ningrum	A perfect film, I love it
eloise634	Excited for this
allthe stars	My Sister and i went to watch the movie having a slight or Maybe even no idea of what Queen and freddie mercury were and we got goosebumps and left the cinema in tears!!! Masterpiece!!! And definitely its best part was Ramis unbelievable perfomance!!!
Jasper Moreno	Must watch! ITS A MUST
Mackie Valenzuela	Watched it yesterday. Entire cinema was singing along to the ending. Powerful. Did not bore me one bit. Great movie. Love from the Philippines  Queen fans will only love Queen more after the film.
Stephanie Compasivo	My heart is screaming to this movie Can't stop crying coz of Freddie 😢 .. One of the Best Movies of 2018 ! BRAVOOOO 👏
Vortis Heminnway	Should I go to this movie dressed up as Yoshikage Kira, or Elliot from Mr.Robot.
FineResolve	is marc martel singing?
Meme Steam	Roses are red I know kung fu      you probably thought I was gonna say we will rock you
Robert Pierce	back in the 70s wasn't really a Queen Fan ...a lot more more better bands during my days..haven't seen the movie yet but my daughter for some reason wants to,,,,i need to know if his homosexuality is portrayed in the movie before i think about taking my girl,,TV14 is a vague rating.
Linea Hernes	I  got chills
Yissel Rey Fuentes	This is the best movie I have seen in my life.
Jesus is Lord	What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul in the end ~ Jesus. If Freddie Mercury didn't repent he perished in his sin of homosexuality, now he is reaping the sorrows and misery of sin by going to an eternal hell. Following the world of fame and fortune is appealing, but it will reap the bitter end of destruction. God is not mocked.
Subarna Figo	0:27 scene should’ve been in the movie
KAREN PIERCE	Saw the movie last night at an IMAX theater.  Totally awesome.  It hit all the important parts without being salacious.  It was well done and completely enjoyable.  The music alone will rock you.   I will see it again before it leaves the IMAX.
Jessica Marie Valeza	It was soooooo worth the wait. We just finished watching the movie. It's beyond amazing! Rami Malek,  I love you! Hahahaha. His portrayal of Freddie was impeccable.
fefi ristiani	😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤
ümit yavuz	Why not marc Martel ? Does anyone liken rami to freddy ??? This is just a big disappointment for me as a big freddy fan ! You are good actress rami but not freddy :( ...
Benjamin Fjeld	Sasha should have played the role of mercury.. Obviously.
Yusuf Dhansay	You are a legend fred  Freddy: we are all legend   This line tho. Liiiiiit

Shadow :3	I just can say this is the movie with the best soundtrack EVER.
interuś	Aktor z filmu need for speed
D.A. Visual	Just watched the World Premiere yesterday in cinema in Macedonia. I've been waiting for it some time now anxious. Meanwhile watched almost every documentary i could find about Queen. Being 28y old i heard of Queen and listened their songs probably since 15y ago but i have never ever been so attached to their songs as in this past year. Playing them on repeat and whole playlists. Now seeing all of that, the documentaries and the story of Freddie and so on, due to how amazing this film is, i was in same time disappointed that in the film the timeline of the events are not really portrayed correctly.   Freddie coghs blood as early as 1983 and tells his band he has the aids before the Live Aid concert in 1985 which is not correct. He gets news about it in late 1986 or 1987 and tells his band in 1989 when they get back in Montreaux for the Innuendo album.   In that regard i expect bit more drama and more fitting timeline.   This way, although still somehow oddly fitting and nice, it wasnt just correct and accordingly dramatic.   Anyway i advise who havent to go and watch it because its great tribute for a great band! If not greatest, darling!
theCrimsonViper	dayum. 3 legendary Queen songs in one trailer. super lit
bibek aryal	Never had i experienced the whole threater singing loud any song from the movie  But this time just wow every single one was singing every single song 🤘🤘
Carrie Johnstonxx	I love how they showed all the music...they used them at the perfect time especially another one bites the dust
Chandhan D	Rami did an amazing acting. I wish this movie wins oscars..

hi mil	i watched the film yesterday and by end the entire crowd was crying  one of the best movies i’ve ever seen and definite must watch.  the lead actor’s performance was out of this world.
John Jhon	Are we just gonna ignore the fact that they use the same audio as Suicide Squad.
Liza Balogh	BEST FILM EVER
Darren Taylor	And the winner is........Rami Malek!!!!!
Amara Milenia Widanti	This movie is so amazing. I watched it 2 times and sometime I would like to watch it again!

chimpot gaming	Ready Freddie Mercury
Macedonian Sun	i've watched it yesterday....this is masterpiece ,best movie i've watched. Oscars on the way !!!
Luke Simpson	I love this movie because everybody working on the movie DID NOT fall prey to leftist, liberal critics! The band and producers didnt try to cover facts or real events. Critics are butthurt because they didnt portray Freddie Mercury gayer than he actually was. He was bi-sexual and still slept with women!
Miguel Tuazon	rami is freddier than freddie
Detroit Red Wings Hockeytown	I’m going to sing along to the songs when this comes out.
Chloe Mei	I JUST SAW IT! PHENOMENAL 😍😍
Bara Borneo	Sadly in my country this movie rating is 17+ i can't watch this movie //Sad
XbomberGames	Just saw the movie, and was just perfect. No other way to put it
Rick Cummings	It was awesomeness on a stick!!!
Andrea Waters	I just finished watching Bohemian Rhapsody and all I can say is BRILLIANT ... Like a ripple on the water, the story spreads out , and adds just the right amount of their lives , things they faced , and finally overcame . While each member of the band was brilliant in their own rights, Queen was the true epitome of a family . The makers of this movie however understood that Queen was all about their music , and using that as the center of this movie, the end result became a true master piece.  In the end they became a true powerhouse,  that no one can touch , and no one will ever be able to duplicate .  And as for  Freddie  ? You take a perfectionist , add a wee bit of eccentric, a heart and soul as large as the universe , mix well with the other members of the band,  and I think he is smiling and at peace knowing , that his music, and his work was understood . And in the end that is enough .
TheEndOfThought	Just got back from Sneak preview tonight, November 1st and it was the best movie I have seen in years.  IT was like being in a documentary and rock concert all at the same time.  Them cutting Fat Bottom Girls in the obvious spot that is what meant to be put in is a test of our times of censorship for the whiny progressives who ruin everything because they feel guilty about being given everything in the world and they dont know what to do with it.  Check it out if you like good music and a great story of  a real rock legend!
Donna Franzoni	Can't wait to see this movie!
baby talia	Can't wait to cry to this tomorrow

Inumiko :P	Absolutely amazing movie. Had me in tears! It's insane how much they replicated, to the T! Perfect performance! Oscar worthy!
Brooklyn Brown	I may be only like 13, but like I grew up with queen, if it wasn't for my grandmother who listen to 1970's and 1980's music in car I wouldn't know them. This is movies looks amazing (and im probably like the only 13 year old in my school who wants to see this movie so badly) I wish I grew up more with queen, Hopefully I will see this movie!
C_MaSteR_Y	Fearless more like Fe4rless

Skars	James hetfield deserves one of these. Please make it happen.
Mike Grant	I've never been a Queen fan. I've had my fave tunes like.... Hammer to falll, Seven seas, ya know the boss rock tunes.... Anyway, I went to see the movie today and have to say, it is an exceptional piece of film.  The actors playing the band were all brilliant and pulled it off with aplomb.  The soundtrack well...BOSS!!!  Hey, it was such a cracking story told so well that I even cried a few times.... Brilliant film, cast, soundtrack and all round tale of a cracking band!!
Dino Riyami	Seen the film twice in one week! Top film my fave at the moment.. I have the same birthday as freddie and I'm half English half zanzibian.. Was born here in England though. Definitely needs to be seen in the cinema. Especially the last 20 mins live aid show!
Xx Angel xX	who else has a crush on the drummer? like if you do :3
Omar Borg	I saw this movie and it's an epic film but if your're a real fan of QUEEN you see that there is so many mistakes in it. There is almost 8 things that didn't really happened in real life, (example) when they are making we will rock you Freddie is with moustache and short hair and in real life he was with long hair and no moustache at that time, (2) when i read a biography i read that he knew he had aids between 1986 and 1987 and in the movie he knew just weeks before live aid 1985. (3) The band didn,t split, they had the tour of the album THE WORKS so the last show was just 8 weeks before live aid . they all wanted a break.(4) His lover Jim Hutton was not a bartender he was a hairdresser and they met at a night club.(5)John Deacon wasn't the first bassist he was i think the fourth one. there ar 3 other mistakes so how did things like this appear in a movie of this quality.
19890 16	The best movie !!!!!

MATILDANYA Peralta	When Freddie said to Mary, "I'll always take care of you.", I died because he gave her most of his fortune and really did take care of her.❤️😭❤️  Freddie is so amazing. And HUGE thank you to Brian for producing this moving and providing alot of the details 😂💕

T. I.	Amazing movie. No more words.
Nuke'Em	sacha baron cohen would have been alot better, he quit because the rest of the band didnt want the wild stories to be told just to protect there image. sacha wanted a more accurate portrayel of freddie. freddie was crazy, done more cocaine than anyone else on the planet, had little dwarves at parties walking around with trays of cocaine on there heads! this would have been great material for a film! they missed a great opportunity.
Alekasndra Suszek	Słyszałam, że podobno film kapitalny i ma szansę dostać Oskara. Idę z mamą ❤
Good Night	This film was so good that I sat in the cinema for one hour needing to pee really badly but not wanting to miss a minute of the movie. You need the more silent parts to understand what's happening and the parts where they're recording or on stage you don't wanna miss because the music is so great. Amazing movie.

Nicholas The Kid	Who is better  Freddie Mercury (Queen) Michael Jackson Or John Lennon (The Beatles) Tell me in the comments
Oppothumbs M	A much better movie would be about The Replacements, who should be in the Rock Hall of Fame. Never like Queen.
Hard Truth	Looks like a great movie, however, I can't say I like who they picked to play Freddy..Doesn't really look like him at all......
Jovenaj Austin Chavenia	Just watched the film yesterday and it was so fckin great. The Live aid Scene was so fckin good. Give Rami Malek a Best actor award
SpeedWolf	It's a Pity it didn't work out with Sacha Baron Cohen but providing the movie is good who cares.

Krešimir Marinić	You twats should have let Cohen make the real movie about Freddie and the madness, greatness and debauchery that Queen was! This is hilarious and i hope we’ll see the real version of the movie someday. Whats wrong with the filmindustry, everyones got the disney sindrome..

Catalina Pulgar	When you can't get your own money because you are just 13 :( And your parents want to see it too but they don't have the money :(
Clémence 8335	Brillant. Fantastic. Breathless. What a movie ! Rami Malek is absolutely fantastic ! He deserves an oscar for this incredible performance. It's so realistic and I love the fact that they don't hide Freddie's sexuality like so many movies did. Live aid part is just unbelievable ! Queen is timeless. They are legends and it's a beautiful tribute. Freddie would always have a special part in my heart and not just my heart. Millions of hearts. I cried and sang and laughed. Go see it's an experience ! THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. They are the champions my dear !
Joy1977	Just saw this today.To say it`s brilliant is an understatement! "A star is born" has a strong contender for the Oscars! @Rami Malek blew my mind with his portrayal of the legendary Freddie Mercury."love of my life" gave me chills.

Peter Janes	Wonderful film... and thank God for Mary Austin, travelling to see Freddie Mercury, to tell him about LiveAid, as, her phonecalls to Freddie were being thwarted by a piece of northern irish scum called paul prenter. This sad parasite nearly changed the course of performance history.... for the worse, of course, as is the wont of nordie scum. Thank you again, Mary Austin, a true friend to this fine genius, Freddie Mercury.

Koala kun	Awhile ago me and my bandmates went to the cinemas because the movie was released today and since today was the only day that we have alot of free time we planned on watching this. We got there as early as we could just so we could buy tickets before it gets crowded and we almost cried (well one of us did lmao) when the one selling tickets said that they cancelled the movie today because they were having this maintenance shet on the cinema.   .  .  So here I am, watching the trailer over and over cuz me and my bandmates just had the most painful heartbreak awhile ago.

Fortnite Shorts	OMG I’m gonna cry 😢
WoWoWoW WOOIO	Can’t wait to see this
Wedrana A.	Watched it yesterday in cinema, and it was beautiful. Cried like five times, and  almost started full blown singing, but fortunately I stopped on time XDD
Vast Wasp	Just went to see this
Brian Griffiths	I saw this film a couple of hours ago in my local cinema and it is really brilliant and worth all the hype. Unlike most of the critics, I was a teenager when the events depicted in the movie were happening for real and they are all much as I remember them. Even if you are not a Queen fan, the music is excellent and Rami Malek makes a very convincing Freddie Mercury.
Reese Issel	British Minister Nottinghill in a BBC Under Cover Assignment - As Freddy Mercury to inspire Freddy Mercury to become the lead singer of Queen as Freddy Mercury the person inspired British Minister Nottinghill to be more than just a Minister.
seasonedtoker	Too bad the rest of the band is depicted like a bunch of dumbasses, who were just learning from Freddie, and lacked creativity and that special touch. Brian May in the movie stands like a coat hanger in the studio recording BoRap's solo, being very watchful if thise are the notes Freddie wanted him to play, but in reality that solo is pure Brian May.
UJR78	Wow... he did not nail this at all...     terrible,  just terrible.             It's Queen...   Not drag queen.
nabila khondaker	Please make a film on Gun's n Roses!!!!!!Please 20th century fox!!!!!
fsebascb89	En la película se ve que we Will rock you la componen cuando Mercury tenía bigote, es decir a principios de los 80's, pero en realidad la componen en 1977 y en el videoclip sale con cabello largo y sin bigote......
jon doe	Looks like a garbage move about a garbage band.
stan2703	Loved this film. So many critics seem to think it's mediocre, definite example of how they don't always get it right as everyone seems to love it.
Shawn Billy	We  don't care about Critics, I'm just gonna enjoy this like no other movie ever before!! Queen Forever!
Lily-May Bruton	Has anyone else already seen this I saw this at the cinema yesterday
Slb Mendes	1:27 Best shot

sendi antoni	Keren....
Louise MacAllister	Hands down, the greatest film I’ve ever seen! Rami Malek deserves an Oscar for his phenomenal performance.
Ange	I'm excited to see Rami as Freddie but I can't help but think what Rafael de la Fuente  would look like playing Freddie Mercury. Rami looks awesome though!
Hilde Orens	To the people who think everyone will sing in the theatre: they do not play the entire songs. I saw it in the theatre and if anything, people were quiet as a mouse, absolutely speechless. Greatest movie I've ever seen!
Matien Azemy	Can’t believe Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 55%. It looks amazing!!!!!!!

nice lady	ready Freddie???? lol....
Aidan Alsip	Is this the real life?... Yes Freddie ur a idol in so many ways to this planet. Is it all just a fantasy?... No they are making a movie of you and all those people who listen to people just speaking words with a beat will get to realize what real music is cozz of this movie, that u actually feel when u sing, not just see the 💰 a certain song is going to make you. R.I.P. Freddie Mercury, I wish I could have met you :(

White Head	Rami Malik
My Biz	Loved the movie! Don't know how accurate all events are, except Live Aid, that's bloody accurate! I hardly ever cry watching movies, but I was so close more than once.  Freddie's actual singing  fits great with  Rami's acting. Thank god that clown Sasha whatever was booted off this movie, he lacks sensitivity and emotion that Rami has in abundance! This movie will not only rock you, it will MOVE you.
Krogg Rache	(((Queen)))
James Cope	Not only was this 2018’s best movie but it’s the best movie over all of the movies out there , there are going to be more awards than any other movie ever for this, truly incredible : 5 star  , I’d highly recommend it 😌

Mélanie MEINRAD	Best trailer ever made. Feels so powerful already
lama hasan	from only seeing the trailer i can say confidently it would be a huge shame if malek didn't got the oscar 4 this . BRAVO!!!
Jhoncena Mariposa	That signature teeth make a history
Tamara Miller	Obviously, I haven't seen the movie yet- but, the part where he's playing Freddie and says "what if I don't have" So far, that has been the most perfect, spot on Freddie I've seen so far.  Not only just to look, but his voice, accent and even the way his teeth would make him have somewhat of an accent- perfectly done.   Friday just can't get here fast enough! LOL.  I wish the whole bunch of YouTube videos with the cast and the band members of Queen and their opinions, the work they put into it, etcetera.... Makes the anticipation more incredible and the look of the film more incredible!
suicide boy	OMG I WANNA SEE IT ❤     BUT I'M BROKE AF 😭

tignesboy	great movie
Najam Sheikh	Sacha Baron Cohen.
amanda tucker	CAN'T. WAIT. TO. SEE. THIS!!!!!!!
lynda Thackrey	Wow.  I really enjoyed this movie is an understatement.  Credit to all cast and actors who clearly put all the effort into this movie. It's true Rami Malek's performance was outstanding. Let's not forget other actors who's performance also paid off this story telling of Queen of there highs and lows on their journey to the top. This movie had me hooked from start to finish, with a few laughs along the way including tears and smiles . For me the story telling makes this movie,   and I was able to visually  appreciate the story of Freddie and Queen's recreation of live aid. The costumes were spot on,  and there really is a lot of incredible shots and  beautiful cinematography through out this film. I'm not a huge fan of Queen but this movie took me and my filmmaker husband by surprise. We immensely appreciated this movie.  massive emotional thumbs up.

Panicat the fallout	Bring a box of tissues

Jaybird069	Should’ve used Ben Stiller for the role of Freddie

Goodlies	Absolutely incredible movie. Freddie was a legend.
C H L O E	Those long hair remind me of hair the musical 😂🌠
Major blitz	iTS ABOUT TIME
Mr Gigoustic	A really good film. I saw it yesterday but there were a few mistakes. Freddy did not have a mustache when they recorded We will Rock You and it was 1977 not 1980 (As in the film) when it was released. Fat bottomed girls was also played live in the film in Queen's very early days regardless of the fact that it was not written until 1978 and Freddy was not diagnosed with AIDS until 1987, two years after live aid; whereas the film shows him being diagnosed before live Aid in 1985. There are other small issues but I will not spoil the film and it is really good apart from those things. I got my guitar out as soon as I got back. GREAT!!
Sofia Rye	I love Queen so much. and each one of the band is AMAZING and I want to go see them so bad
Abady Youseph	Will take Rami Oscar this year.!
Usain Bolt MSP	watching this on tuesday, i can tell this is going to earn oscars

laura gervoyse	IT WAS AMAZING
Maximus Prime	This movie is long overdue. Hopefully if its good it'll inspire a break from super hero movies and get onto rock n roll biopics. There are a lot of stories that need to be told.
Lucy Flaherty	I can only imagine what Freddie would’ve said about this 😂
fatty evans	And critics said this movie would be bad.       I say badass

claude	The director of this film is a sexual predator who has victimized CHILDREN. Please don't support this film. Watch this documentary and educate yourself.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BktYQGWtN1U&t=0s&list=PL4iIOsrJ5nGh_TeBZyQN9XxiIXpx-eZR-&index=3
hdjksa52	I am _so_ going to watch this movie
Mambo91549	Just saw this movie yesterday. Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury performance is unbelievably awesome and definitely deserving of an Oscar nomination for Best Actor :) Dare I say, probably one of the best on-screen performances since Heath Ledger's Joker? :)
RPG 808	Just pull up a live concert on youtube and I am sure it will be FAR better than this POS film.
Dot Bendulhi	a trailer never enough

Luke THE RAGER	Mother i just killed a man i didnt mean to make you cry OOOOOOOH
tribal spaceman	BAD MOVIE. this movie does not do justice to queens legacy. it is so badly made. its like watching a tv movie that is souless. freddie and queen deserved a lot better than this garbage, and it does not uphold the magnificence of queen. its like going through thier wikipedia page . what a horrible movie to be made on one of the greatest rock bands of all time. the  producers should be held accountable for ruining queens image. and not giving the public the true legacy of queen. retarded acting and a very bad movie. avoid if you prefer to remember queen the way the were.
Magdalena S.	Mr Robot? Seriously?!?
Poondeh	Best movie I've seen in 2018 and definitely in my top 10. I love Queen :)

jeaux bleaux	Wow. this going to be a terrific film.
Pratap Lama	What’s that mean PG-13
FinalSecretOfChrono	I can't be the first to notice how much Rami Malek looks like -Freddie Mercury- Mick Jagger.
MasterOfGames95	i like the mix in the beginning of the trailer of their two most popular songs
Amer Gammas	He looks more like Gordan Belfort
Matt Crosland	I am so excited I watched the trailer like 7 million times
Roxanne Moser	Deacon! Another one bites the dust.
Barcelona Treble Winner Twice	I wish the CGI can make his actor face more like realistic like Fred...He is not lookong Fred enough to me...
Valerei Renfro	I wished that my friend Danny aka Pepsi were alive to see this movie made about Freddy Mercury & Queen.   Danny LOVED Freddy Mercury! He really did.   RIP Danny!  I wished you could've  been around to see this movie.  And RIP Freddy!
GDSprodify	Here Before Rami Malek Takes Over The World.
Papamurff	It's a crapsody. Dont see it.
sandra Rojas	I see that the ending will be not good but EMOTIONAL TO EVERYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE SUFFERED FROM AND DIED OF     JUST SAYING TO PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW HE HAD AIDS I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT....
Edwin A.	The Original Song Doesn’t Actually Say “Of The World” don’t @ me
DreDeny	Here’s the thing I have against this motion picture before watching it... it uses the actual music. I wish they would have made it more organic by having the celebrities create the music, no matter the training or matters for casting.
Emilia Grosso	I just saw this film last night, very well executed and so beautifully done. I laughed and cried it was brilliant, you must see this  masterpiece #ripfreddie
Quietbut_Deadly	I want a mashup of bohemian rhapsody and we will rock you just like how the beginning of the trailer was

gasmask_creations	Fortune favors the bold
arosewater	2:18 my mom jokingly asked me why there was a house in the middle, saying that there was a guy there who couldn’t sleep because of all the clapping and the noise crying “quieeeeeeeeeeet!!”
aikorose	Who wants to go see this with me?
Ed S	I saw “Free Solo” today.  It is a movie about the only person to ever climb “El Capitan” without a rope.  On the trailer for that movie one of the critics says that movie “gives the rest of us an opportunity to experience the human sublime”.  Some might say that watching Freddie Mercury does the same.
Bilbo Swaggins	Can't wait
Ben Quinney	Queen for millennials
Cupcake Sprinkles	I have to see this! I will literally go by myself if I have to😂
Shela Tjhia	Goosebumps
Vickers Productions	Looks good, but I still reckon Sasha Baron Cohen would have been perfect for this
Nigel Wood	better win Oscars! Freddie would want it that way.
Britt Brat	*OMG! OMG! OMG! Next Thursday @7:00pm... I bought my tickets a month ago. I'm SOOOOOO excited!!!!* #longliveQueen #FreddieForever  ❤️💜💝❤️💜💝❤️💜💝
Kiera Birch	I love the line "what more do you wanna know,I write music" hits me hard because stars today and then are and were  surrounded by scandals and overall "beef",but I don't like to say that..between having George Michael fill in for Freddie Mercury in the tribute concert.that was just iconic and is amazing.. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE LIVE AID PERFORMANCE THAT IS LEGENDARY THAT'S WHAT LEGENDS ARE MADE OF... but I hope David Bowie will be in this film Like having a scene were they come up with under pressure
Salb814	They say they can't tell the difference between Freddie mercury and rami malek but I think that's bogus. He does not really look like him at all. He's just dressed like him. Sacha baron Cohen would have been a better choice since he looks more similar and had a better idea of how to make a movie about both the band and Freddies personal life compared to this disappointing film
Dan	Great movie
Jerry Traveler	I love Jesus but I drink a little and lisetn to Queen. I am supring my Granddaughter and taking her to this movie.It does not start paling in our Threathers until Nov 1.
James Ji	Dam i respect Rami for taking on the role of Freddie... just imagine the pressure!
Martin Ribulotta	Is it November yet?
Vince Wise	Just got back from the cinema in Wells UK , this film is emotionally CHARGED! , my wife and i were certain we weren't the ONLY ONES with a tear in our eye! , fabulous film and massive credit to the Brian May , Roger Taylor and all the cast , brilliant job.Got to be an Oscar nomination surely!
Aditya Sanjeev	I think rami is a good choice to play freddie the only thing that bugs me is that freddie was a large and muscular man whereas rami is a little too thin.
Joel Rainer	Best movie, best actor
Jen M	do not miss this movie!!! Will watch it in theatres again

Betty Swollacks	I think it is kinda funny how Mike Myers plays the guy who doesn't believe Bohemian Rhapsody will be a hit and yet Mike Myers also plays Wayne in Wayne's World and we see him famously rocking to it in the car. 😆
Fictions	Chills !
itcfan	Great film, quite an emotional roller coaster. Fitting tribute to a great band and the great Freddie. Ignore the critics and go and see. The recreation of Live Aid was fabulous!
Kevin Deegan	I saw the film last night and it was great but I just wish I was able to see them live since I'm too young to have been there when he was

anette julianna	watched this and loved it!!
vincent hewlett	i was looking forward to seeing this but not now....they say that Brian and Roger kept insisting that they must show that freddie wasnt the only member, a lot of things about freddie have been left out..they insisted on letting the viewer know who wrote this song that song....one film critic said i quote " if you want to listen to queen music you must go....if you want to see the freddie bio its supposed to be then dont go." unquote.....another said " the performance of Rami Malik saved the film............

Couldn’t see an awful lot & honestly don’t remember that much about it but I remember when Freddie started Radio Ga Ga, huge record at the time, that was a moment that stuck.
Purba Chandra	Queen the movie is done and wonderful. Next can't wait for Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Rolling Stones the movie?
Hannah Cheramy	Comment #4: Hey, if you like bohemian rhapsody you should go check out @zoeyleven she has an official cover of bohemian rhapsody on her YouTube, and it's awesome!

Hadi Himawan	BEST FILM DOCUMENTARY WAS I SEE. 9/10
p pRk	I was so shocked by their music especially Bohemian Rhapsody even though I am 18 years old. And when I heard drum sound in this trailer's intro. It became all reason why I must see this movie..
MP R	Hopefully this inspires some new bands.   Y'know...   real music.

Solomongrundy88	The movie is not out yet and I already noticing bloopers in it, I really hate when they don't put attention to details. A multi-million dollar movie and it seems like they have no clue about the history of Freddie mustache, or am I the first one noticing it ?

Trixie draper	This looks sickkk!!
alan1963	I'm sure that the late Freddie Mercury and Queen will always felt very happy and proud of that latest rock-n-roll biographical film "Bohemian Rhapsody", even though Freddie Mercury has left us too soon on November 24, 1991 at the age of 45 from complications of AIDS disease.  Thanks for the music you made for everyone of us, Freddie.  May he rest in peace.  Amen.

John Yates	Saw it last night, great acting, brilliant music, not a great film unfortunately, bit disappointed
Alex Weiner	The transition in 0:39 just screams out Oscar. It’s a shame rotten tomatoes will prevent that from happening
jamie wesson	whats live aid nobody told me about it says freddie  not a bad film but the script re writes history to fit the film and he looks more like jagger in the early years
mara lovic	Freddie the Eternal 💓
David Farrell	Oscarworthy!!!
Panicking Pilots	Fuckin chills mate
Rogy Sweidy	Freddie we love you... You are a legend...Rock forever
Annie Lou	Rami Malek has nailed Freddie’s mannerisms. Freddie was my hero I was there for live aid and queen completely stole the whole show. Can’t wait to watch this. It’s about time a movie was made about his life.

BlaQ Ice	Oh i fell in love when i saw the trailer! I’m such a Queen fan!!!
Salvador Iniguez Jr	It’s funny.. my wife knows very little of queen but recognizes most of their songs because they’ve been featured in so many trailers and movies. This songs will forever be embedded in our souls. I was maybe 7 when I first heard queen.. don’t laugh.. but it was mighty ducks lol.
Beautiful Norris	they consider making a movie called "stairway to heaven" or "good times bad times" for led zeppelin sounds quite delicious
Nicole Starkey	I find it funny that the guy said that no one would play queen. When nearly 3 decades later they are still one of the most played bands.
Sami Austin	they said OF THE WORLD conspiracy theory debunked
Anup Grg	Waiting for movie
Steph H	Remember the live  singing voice was done by Mark Martel! (mixed a little with Rami Malek)

Nathaly	I am so excited for this! 😍
LoungeJay	If this film doesn't touch on Freddie's AIDs I predict a bit of a backlash.
Elsa Ruuskanen	I really hope this will be a great movie. Freddie deserves nothing but great for a movie about him.  I also hope they somehow address AIDS, and focus on his sexuality (I know they will at least a little bit, but it was a big part of his life, so should be a big part of the movie.).
keith parkhill	The reviews are trickling in and they are not kind. The words used to describe this hot mess. Bland, Simplistic, etc and so forth.

Now I'm again excited about Queen music.. even more  than ever! This movie brings me back to 80's!  Just like I would have been there for a while.. again! Fantastic!! Extremely well done!
AlexLordAlcyone	This is the most anticipated movie in ages!!!!    I can't imagine a more nerve wracking role for an actor. Those are such mighty boots to fill, knowing full well that you have to convey one of the greatest performers of all time... and that his legions of fans want nothing less than the best...
Zack Brumis	Just imagine how wealthy Queen would have been if they got royalties every time that song of theirs was used in high school pep rallies.
Travis Green	My girlfriend is taking me to see this for my birthday. Freddie Mercury is by far my favorite singer/songwriter. If time machines are ever a thing, I am traveling back to July 13th, 1985...LIVE AID!!!!! Sadly I was born in 92

Darglief	Under pressure better be in this movie. It wasn't in the trailer so it concerns me.
Saga Vähäsalo	I will be the first person from finland who will be watching this
mrjinkorea	Sure, the trailer looks enticing, but trust me, this is gonna be a sanitized version of Freddie Mercury's life. Prepare to be (slightly) disappointed
nurul as'ad	got a goosebump just by watching the trailer
Carlos Anaya	Looks like they picked someone eerily similar to him or does that speak more of the make up artist?
shreya raj	I wish freedie was alive to see this
lizardfromouttaspace	Freddie would've been proud.
Nick Cockayne	CGI Shots of 80’s Wembley give me goosebumps. Yes it was dated, it had a greyhound track around it and the sightlines from many seats were poor by modern standards but the place had an aura, soul and presence about it that the current plastic and soulless shithole will never ever match. How those Wembley Towers were demolished is a national travesty and tragedy.

Zorian	As a VORACIOUS Queen fan since the early 70's, I can't WAIT for this movie to hit theaters!  I have just about EVERY album they ever put out and STILL rock their music.  It never gets old!  Rest In Power Farrokh Bulsara.  I miss the music you all COULD'VE made but am grateful for the music you all DID make.
Melissa Vidrio	this looks epic i’m big excited
Speediablo 7 Productions	After this, you should make a movie about Green Day featuring Billie Joe Armstrong as the lead actor while he's still around! Just a suggestion!!!
Julio Padilla	We want a movie like this  about PRINCE.

Fakhri Ramadhan	Cant wait!
G C	A fever of possers are coming...great
DeathCage357	People have been saying that We are the champions ending doesn’t have “of the world” in the ending of the song. They used this as an example of Mandela effect. But at the end of this trailer they say “ of the world”          ????

James At	So it's Queen vs Elton John. Bring it on!
Kaneki is A Good Boy	the one and only movie that appropriate to watch with ur father.
Johnny Jabsco	This doesn't look good. It must be the hardest thing ever for an actor to play a person who exists/existed. Val Kilmer managed to pull it off as Jim Morrison and Judy Davis was amazing as Judy Garland. They clearly haven't chosen the right actor here. Even watching the trailer you can see he is a million miles away from the real person.
Dsaazz Daud	Yesssss! Finally.
Andy Saenz	This is going to be an EPIC film! I'm so excited!
Mr. Sarcastic	MAN IF PEOPLE DON'T SING IN THE THEATRES I WILL BE FURIOUS

Its—Me Anthony	There are many things I wish I was alive to whiteness, a Reagan Presidency, the Berlin Wall being torn down, and being able to see Freddy Mercury perform live.
Khwaja Obaid	I recommend it to be watched.  I have been officially screening this movie and have done it several times, there are two big faults in this movie. I will not allow myself to reveal those faults due to Legal Copy rights and once you watch the movie please watch it so deep and get into the script and dialogues and write your honest review about this movie. Its good movie but with two big faults. I don't think it will get to Oscar. If it does I personally will stop watching movies.

jonanjello	Did Roger and Freddie feud often?
Nabisco Snacks	We were learning to play Under Pressure on guitar in music class and this kid says " I don't think this counts as rock, ACDC is way better" and I was so close to standing up and yelling at him.
Mr M	Were all lengends:freddie
The How to Dagger	Dats Vewy Noice.
Michael Johnsen	0:25 - first image of Freddie made it look like an SNL skit, but the full trailer has me really interested. That last shot blew me away.
Lars Zzzz	🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Nissy Wardlow	I'M SO FUCKIN HAPPY HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHHHHHHHHHAHAHHA
Floymin	While I sincerely hope Westboro Baptist Church does NOT get into the news about this, I'm still looking forward to seeing them humiliate themselves.
Ally Sommy	Is that rami singing in the background? Or still mercury? Any video links of rami singing live?
Mari Herrera	There is no straight washing and their not trying to cover up his sexuality. The girl that is emphasized in the trailer is Mary Austin!!! A person he dated, trusted, and once engaged with. Once he said and I quote "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. I couldn't fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary."
Taehyungs slush	Im so happy this exists 😭😭😭😭😭 Why tf am i bawling my eyes out!!
David Gutierrez	"You're a legend Fred. We're all legends" best part of the trailer
Lynnerry	Man, the people who made this trailer had it easy with their song selections. Queen songs are so common in trailers that it's kinda funny to see them appear in a trailer because the movie is about the band that made them.
Lee Jongsuk	Already iconic
L1GHTG30 GD	“We are legends”
sarah ramirez	I see an oscar...this movie looks Badass

ZonaSultan	WE ARE LEGENDS!!
Aayushi Verma	Why did I have goosebumps watching a movie trailer?
evan versace	icon💪🏼
Cyber Cyborg	Freddy Mercury was from the 'Parsi' community. Its a small community in India who follow Zoroastrianism religion. They're descendants of Persia. During the muslim invasion of Persia some Zoroastrians took refugee in India to preserve their religion. They're very hardworking people. They're often very well educated and well mannered people. I'm sure those who are fan of Mercury already knew this probably but still thought to share this with people who don't know.
Adrian R	Queen & Pink Floyd are my 2 fav bands, Who's no 1 depends on my mood at the time. This trailer gave me chills. I'll be going to see it for sure.
james mackman	whats the song at 1:34?

Demonlord Belsenlokh	Oh God, the anticipation... the excitement... it's overflowing.... I... I need someone to help me carry it before it crushes me!!!
Divet Duncan	Can we have more movies about bands
Mike Murphy	Rarely has a trailer given me chills.  This one did.    I'm old enough to remember Queen's appearance at Live Aid, July 13, 1985 at Wembley.  Bob Geldof said they were the best band in the world that day -- by far.
LilO SoliS	my friend Daniel galas keeps playing this song and it’s been etched into my brain I can’t NOT think of it. I wake up at 2 am. Bohemian rhapsody. The middle of a test? BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.
Duck Tape	I just hope this is no commercial-only BS
Cool Bennie Gaming	How would people dislike this its a classic
Awful Falafel	Take my money
tom payne	Something happened to me for the first time just now. I’m not soppy or overly sensitive and I don’t cry. BUT my mum and dad raised me on queen and I grew up loving queen and everything about them and when he says ‘what if I don’t have time’, for the first time ever for a TRAILER..........

Avery Grant	It sounds like “Queen are the champions”
Here For the TEA!	I’m actually so excited to see this movie. Like the trailers are so good, and I haven’t been really excited to see a movie in a while. Like today movies (for me) don’t have that “thing”. that “thing” that makes movies really good or make people want to see it. it’s alway been “eh..it was okay” with today’s movies and like I’m really exited to see this movieeee. I feel the drive to see it ( I barely know much about Queen, don’t come for me 💀💀💀💀). I’m really excitedddd

Anakin Skywalker	Mr. Elliot Alderson having another delusion.

He did his schooling in a boarding school in Panchgani India.   Parsi's  are from Iran and fled Iran in 635 AD when Arabs invaded Iran. They fled to India.  Ironic isn't it. His parents are from India. He was born in Zanzibar. Raised in India. But only a few handful of Indians know about him.   Rest of the world does not even know about his Indian / Iranian roots.

Oishika Datta	Here at my place when people (mostly friends at school) ask me who my favourite singer is, the answer's always, always Freddie Mercury, though 'singer' is too small a term for him. They do this :  1. Cringe at the 'bizarre' name 2. Look into each other's faces like       😶😮😲 3. Ask me "Who the hell is that?"  All I can tell them is that I don't have words to describe who he is.

It's been a journey with her finding herself. 💖💖 While on this journey together for her identity and acceptance of self....we took time to explore the music of all those who were ever different...and were bold enough to be out there! My lesbian daughter is amazing, brave, and connects with Freddie. We could NOT BE MORE EXCITED FOR THIS FILM!!! Also fans of Mr. Robot (which we always watch together).....There could not possibly be better casting in maybe the history of film....than Rami Malek!!! #FirstInLineForTickets  Is it too soon to say that Rami, might be the next Bobby Dinero?? 😎😎👏👏

chiandra prasetya	“On the world”
Audis Miyati	That backstage jump on 0.16 give me chills !
Randal The Vandal	“Roger, there’s only room in this band for one hysterical queen.”  People always say how he was amazing at controlling the crowd, but this just shows that he took no prisoners.
AstrolaBe88	the resemblance is average, I saw live the argentine tribute band "god save the queen", and there I was amazed by the performance. Resemblance and musical and scenic quality, see their performance. They are incredible
Mike	How the fck does anyone take a movie about Freddie Mercury seriously when they cast a guy with a baby smooth chest?  Do they think that we're just aren't going to notice?  If they could give this guy Mercury's famed overbite, then why not glue a little OK, a LOT of hair on his chest.  MAJOR gaff.
Hungry Basset	It should have been Sacha Baron Cohen's roll.

Rakesh Karel	My biggest worry is that this movie ends after Live Aid and didn't have The Magic Tour, the recordings of The Miracle and Innuendo. I'm afraid they will not show Freddie's last year and his fight with AIDS.
Lilly Spath	If you had asked me before watching this trailer if Rami Malek could pull off playing Freddie Mercury, I would've laughed at you.  Now I'm sitting here in awe, not being able to wait to see the full product!! Even though I'm sadly too young to have experienced them live, I grew up with them, my dad always playing their songs and singing them together with me. I'm so excited to see this project!

St. Art	Unpopular opinion: I absolutely hate it. Rami looks like a horrible parody of Freddie.Freddie was so unique,you should not try to play him this way.His personality maybe,but not his looks.Some biopics before proofed that it is not so important to copy the look,if the acting is on point.
dyla	I‘m already obsessed
Tigger97	After seeing the documentary (feat. his real friends and people close to him plus characters to give a visual) I have high expectations.

Lo Ra	I'm rooting for this movie.
Bestu Desu	You literally had the perfect actor to play Freddie Mercury in Sacha Baron Cohen, but the idiot surviving members of Queen were too selfish and wanted to make the movie about their life after the band so Cohen left.  Now you have Rami Malek that looks nothing at all like Freddie Mercury playing him.  Was going to see this movie, won't anymore.  You ruined a potentially great movie.  Have fun everyone.

Liyad Salem Mridu	the show must go on love for Freddie
Friendly Condom	Fun fact- MTV refused to show the music video of “I want to break free” and asked Freddie to make a new video for the American public as apparently they couldn’t handle seeing rockstars in dresses, he quite rightly told them to get fucked.
DarthBricksEmpire	Is this the real life?
Leopard Leotard	Honestly the best trailer I've seen in years.

Seila Sanlak	rami malek‘s voice when talking is off, too deep, freddie had a higher voice, more gentle and rami malek is too serious, heavy, freddie was more playful, joyful. i don‘t recognize freddie in malek‘s interpretation, sorry.
sergio pereira	That movie looks crap ! wrong choice of actors. They should have picked  Dominic Cooper for the role of Freddy. He would have been much better, great acting in Devil's double. Anyway, the trailer is so bad that i wont go to big screen and watch tha movie.

Ben Arehart	My stepfather was Vice President of a small record company on Music Row in Nashville Tn. when I was 14, in 1978. When I heard that Queen was coming to our Municipal Auditorium, I was excited. I had never asked my stepdad to pull any strings before, regarding tickets to see bands, but my girlfriend, wanted to see them badly, as I did too. So after asking him the favor, a couple weeks later, he comes home, handing me a rectangular white box. When I opened it, their were two tickets, along with a card for back stage admittance. I about killed over. I told my girlfriend about the tickets, but held the backstage a secret. You should have seen her face, when I led her, by the hand to see the band. She almost started crying. It was one of the best memories as a teenager, and of my life. Miss Freddy Mercury, and his great voice. Cant wait to see the movie.
Heylin C.	I just wished they hired an actor who could act and looked like Freddie it wasn't that hard. Besides his voice his looks were a big part of who he was, Rami is a good actor but he looks nothing like him, in this whole trailer he's like a guy dressed as Freddie for Halloween, disappointing honestly.

s e n	"you're a legend fred." "I'm just a musical prostitute my dear."
David Pradarelli	Only one slight, insignificant error I noticed with the movie. The scene where Brian is telling Freddie about We Will Rock You, Freddie is shown with the mustache. We Will Rock You was released in 1977. Freddie didn't grow his mustache until 1980. Other than my picky two cents, I'm totally jazzed to see this movie.
meedy92	For all you who don't know, Freddie Mercury's real name is Farrokh Bulsara (he was Persian by birth & came from a Zorastrian family) Representation. ✊Proud to have Persian parents; truly a LEGEND! RIP Freddie, you will ALWAYS be remembered for the wonderful music you made & your contributions towards rock. 🙏😢

frank barry	CALLING ALL FANS OUT THERE TAKE NOTICE AT 1.2O IN THIS TRAILER, I am one of the biggest fan of QUEEN there is and looking forward to the movie. But I'm  very observant on detail. I'm not sure whether people have spotted a mistake in this trailer at 1.20 where Brian May wants to write a song that the audience can join in on. Well the mistake been FREDDIE had moustache there. That was NEWS OF THE WORLD ALBUM TIME and FREDDIE had not got a moustache at that time. USUALLY  THE MISTAKES ARE SPOTTED AFTER THE FILMS RELEASE BUT THIS IMISTAKE IS ON THE TRAILER  BEFORE IT'S  EVEN RELEASED ON NOVEMBER 2nd PS, How could you make that simple mistake BRIAN& ROGER if your overseeing the making of the movie?

GTX 1080Ti	Song at 1:34?
Himanshu Mehra	Fortune favour the bold
TornadoChick WeatherNetwork	Everything else is great...i wish he looked just a little more like him.  his eyes do not match at all and the teeth look like his lips are trying to cover the big teeth but arent large enough due to not having them in his mouth his whole life.  Freddie was brilliant, a genius, a trailblazer and one of a kind.  I will probably see the movie just cuz its about freddie, but the actor doesnt bring freddie back for a short time.  Angela Bassett looked amazing as Tina Turner...now THAT was great casting.
SELAHPAUSE	Please please hurry up November 2......I'm calling of sick to see this classic movie of a classic band
Maracachucho	You know that guy looks fine and all but it's kind of a shame hes not nearly as handsome as Freddie.

John Carter	R.I.P Freddie You are the best The King
MR- CODE	No doubt Rami malek is a great actor but Sacha baron would have taken it on another level..!
Shmaynoria	I don't know what it is, but the main actor looks nothing like Freddie Mercury to me, even less so than when Borat was supposed to play him.
Itachi Uchiha	Definitely Sacha Baron Cohan wouldn't have fit. This is too serious and dramatic.
Chris	Back in 85 at Live Aid I stood about ten feet away from Freddie when he was on stage. When he was getting the crowd to repeat back to him the sounds he was making I was right underneath him. When I freeze the D.V.D I can see the side of my head and Freddie in the same shot. I remember when he was singing all I kept thinking what the hell am I going to do when this gig ends. I knew it was a life changer for all the 80.000 or so of us that were there that day. He had us all in the palm of his hand. Sometimes I just cant listen to Queen it just makes me too sad. I think I will go and see this on my own. I remember when he died man I wept. Worst of all if he had kept taking his medication he probably I say probably could still be alive. Rest in Paradise You legend.
naly202	they all look very alike. but Freddie is SO iconic that any actor they chose except a clone of his own cannot give you the same vibe.
Mila C.	I'm gonna sing my heart out at the theater when I watch this

Wanting to get up and dance which I know you wouldn't be allowed to do she has warned me if I start moving around she is going to walk out it is going to take all my self control especially when they sing Radio GA GA at live aid I am so looking forward to this movie
Yeddah Santiago	I'd cry in this movie
KeshKoKid	“What if I don’t have time?” Please don’t make a grown man cry.

Paul Thöni	Am I the only one who wants a full version of that mash up?
Figment HF	Should have been Sasha
isosteric	Live Aid was a complete shambles and for the most part, pretty rubbish. All that changed when Queen took to stage. Arguably the best performance of any band at any concert at any time. Ever.

Toshi Sharma	give this trailer an Oscar already!
valiant971	I'm guessing it will be a G rated version of an X rated life.
Anthony Bay Okay	Much more hyped than the second coming of Christ!
Grace Moses	Rami Malek - you might have just won an Oscar.
Mentari Isnaini	when veteran of Okinawa War become a star
Krishnansh Gaur	When the trailer started and mix of rhapsody and we will rock you played, my heart rate could have killed me.
caomhan84	I hope the movie is good.  It's been in development hell forever, it had an incredibly troubled production.....2 directors, 3 actors for Freddie, multiple rewrites....usually that doesn't bode well.  God I hope it isn't a hot mess.

Right in the feels for those who lived in the period when you can go to a Queen concert, not a Queen + (Insert artist name here) concert, roll on 24 Oct.

clyler	this looks like its gonna be a good movie
Vincent Vega	at 1:22 in the video you see freddie with a mustache but he didnt grow his mustache out until the 1980s which we will rock you was released in 1977 and he should have longer hair and didnt have a mustache just watch the We Will Rock you Music Video. I hope its not like this in the movie
Irm Denissr Meyo Fanco	Soy la única que se emociona por que ya saldrá está película

Tiskatherine	I’m crying and it’s only the trailer
strawcastle	I am crying my eyes out already
Anne Tamondong	Wish they put make up to cover Rami’s eyebags. Freddie’s eyes were the most beautiful and never looked tired or racoonish.
Tardytadpole 686	I've watched the trailer like 100 times
ReneeNme	People really need to stop saying Rami looks " exactly " like Freddie. He looks nothing like the man.

Susan Ortiz	Give this guy the Oscar!!👍☺️
n hardai	Can't wait to see this!
carlos lopez	Oscar to Rami Malek and the guy who play Brian May !!!! This movie will be fantastic !!!
A3sthetic	Oof
JJ Musica	I always freaking tear up when the trailer shows Rami saying, *"I fear I don't have much time."* Like, this movie is gonna kill me and all the Queen fans
broderp	Meh,  this should be a Netflix movie or a TV mini=series.  Not paying money to see this, but the music is awesome.
jim maurice	1:20 I'm not sure about that sequence. Freddie did not have the moustache style yet when "We will rock you" aired out nor was created. Am i right or wrong?
ForZ_X3N0	Honestly he's the only person that looks even close to freddie.
Sabilur Rahman	My god i cant wait!!!!!
Ron Wylie	WOW
Abyss Bun	Killer queen has already touched this comment!
Murilo Melo	I have the utmost respect for Rami Malek but Sacha Baron Cohen would have been SO MUCH better in the role of Freddie. Just look at his Erran Morad character in Who Is America, he looks just like Freddie Mercury and all it takes is the right haircut. Oh, well...
black lightning	Im so looking forward to this.
Listen With Linus	The good news maybe is that this trailer really lowered my expectations. It basically kind of looks like a typical self aggrandizing rockopic...like something that you would see made for VH1...does VH1 still do that even?   Queen is a remarkable and innovative band, but this movie honestly looks boring. If I want to sing a lot to Queen songs, I can just listen to Queen. I am less than excited about this, but we'll see
Emily Wan Dosen	It is pretty sure that rami will win smth for this and i think that he will be nominated  for oscars. Since the beginning of 2018 i havent seen any male lead actor in movies that can fit for oscars. so maybe rami may win oscar for this awesome performance.
Leonard Roškar	what's with the bad cgi at 0:25
Pablo Lutke-Stetzkamp	I wanted Sacha Baron Cohen to play him. He would've been perfect
Kirk Eby	can. not. wait.   what can i pay to see it now?
Neveser Tiryaki	He looks like Mick Jagger!
Nadeem Khan	A sanitized family friendly Hollywood version of the truth. Basically keeping the brand in the public eye to sell more products. Anybody seeking the truth will have to look elsewhere.
Petals Faves	Wow I need to see this  They better not f it up
Met Alizator	This movie should be released in September 5th, on his birthday.

Suck my Deek	I am so exited y'all don't even know
pilates68	pilates68 This movie looks great!!! Remi Malek is uncanny. The trailer does suggest, however, that the movie will advance the idea that Queen were so "out there " that they faced an uphill struggle to have their music heard. But the truth is that many bands in that era were doing progressive experimtal music that was long and not exactly catchy for radio play. They all faced the same uphill struggle with music executives wanting pop songs. I'm talking about YES, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, etc. They all drove the music industry crazy with their concepts and arrangements. Wasn't just Queen. Wonder if this movie will touch on that. 1 day ago
40's Fierce and Fit - Taking charge!	I seriously cannot wait to watch this it is going to be awesome freaking fantastic on the theater screen too can't wait!!
adryan	OMFG NOW IM LEGIT EXCITED FOR THIS CAUSE I KNOW THE SONG AND ABOUT QUEEN MORE THAN EVER!!!!! Rip Freddie WOW 😭😭
Vicky Vargas	YESSSSSSSSS
Priscilla Franco	when this movie comes to theaters I assure you when people wait in the line to get in there seats, they will be singing along to "we will rick you" like a flash mob and it will be epic! Lets have this event be a compilation on YouTube! I also smell Grammy's for the movie.
Crystalize	is this hacker film?
roseall4u 24	Best band ever!! Miss u Mercury
Reignny Joseph	THERE'S NOTHING in the world that can PREPARE you for ONE OF THE BIGGEST Music Movies in History!! Definitely A MUST SEE FILM OF 2018!!! PROBABLY MY NEXT FAVORITE MOVIE OF 2018. Fearless LIVES FOREVER. R.I.P Freddie💖👑🙏✨

Adarsh Thapa	can't wait
Daniel Solis Rodriguez	the style of the Queens band its so ridiculus jajajaja, but the music is good
Moet et Chandon	At 1:22 we see an 80's Freddie talking to a 70's Brian. How is this possible? Time Travel, my fellow Queen fans. Brian May predicted it in the song '39. Check these lyrics out: _"For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year. Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me"_
Cydney Senior	I've never in my life thought that a movie would win a lot of Oscars from just watching the trailer... I mean, come on. This has so much in its future. I can't wait to see it.
Aian Xaharia	Visiting everyday since the release of the trailer!
Marige OBrien	I can't decide if I can bear seeing this.... It's taken weeks just to finally watch the trailer. Rami Malik helps... he does such an amazing job (at least from what's seen here) of portraying FM.  Kids don't understand. This was me! This was my life! Queen WAS my teens... especially in NY. And, yes, I know. Queen wasn't from NY. But they captured NYC in that era, so well. The people, the places, the life. Now all gone, like shadows of the past.  How can you trivialize that with a movie?... any movie. (They never did this to Frank Sinatra.) Legends should remain legends.
Augusto brenes	Muy bueno
Alex da Silva	He doesn't sound like Mercury.

song mei	I’m gonna cry watching this movie for sure!
Mark Minick	Can't Wait. Hugh fan since the very beginning. But I already see a mistake in the film. Freddy did not have his mustache and short hair during the time 'We will rock you' was being recorded. Scene: Where Brian is introducing the infamous 2 Stomp/Clap beat rhythm to Freddie in the studio. That aside, I'm so glad to see one of my all time favorite bands being depicted in a major motion picture release and know I will love every minute of it. Thank you 20th Century FOX and Queen for not giving up on this film project.
Kennedy A	Oh! it should have been Sacha Baron as Freddie, but anyway, Im looking forward to this!

Frederick P.	I once sang bohemian rhapsody in a karaoke bar with my sister after we took 3 shots of tequila to kill the nerves.
Marc Martel Fans	So, Adam Lambert knows when he doesn't have the ability. At least HE knows his limitations, "I don't look like Freddie. I don't sound like Freddie. I sound like me," Lambert explained when asked why he didn't land the gig. "Rami looks amazing. He's a great actor. From what I understand, they used pieces of actual studio recording of Freddie and Marc Martel, who is an impersonator of Freddie Mercury, to do some of the other vocal stuff. So it's really about recreating Freddie. So no, it wouldn't have been me."

There is only one and he was, IS God's Masterpiece.  Of course my heart will break and I will be disappoined, it's not Freddie and I can't believe still, to this day, he actually died - but I know he did.

They are all Legends, along with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Led Zeppelin, Guns n Roses, The Eagles, Nirvana, Aerosmith, Rush, The Who, The Zombies, AC/DC, Metallica, KISS, White Snake, Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Prince, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, Ricky Nelson, Sting and The Police, Elton John and Elvis Presley and all of the music legends in the world.

MGang TV	YOOO! Yeah you reading this comment let me ask you one thing... Do you wake up in the morning asking yourself "What kind of Man/Woman do I want to be in 10 years? Do you want to be the kind thats still hustling or grinding a 9 to 5 hustling for a weekend ? Or Do you want to be the kind that wakes up to your dream home and walks outside every night remembering the days when you didn't have anything. The nights were no one cared about you or your dreams. After all of those days you were hungry now it all paid off and money is no longer an issue. Do better for yourself everyday and don't allow yourself to be a product of your environment. SALUTE

マサキ	Vai ser o melhor filme de todos 😍
Google Google	*The one song I wish was included is "Barcelona" ... not just because I like soccer.... it was played before manchester united won on that magical treble night - when Monserrat sang it to the big screen freddy - I believe Freddie being English ; his spirit carried Manchester United that night. I think all Angel's are allowed 1 miracle from heaven ; that was His. Also it was probably one of the greatest duets of all time*
caraphernelia135	It looks so good! Can’t wait ❤️

channel dixon	Galatians 5:19-21 New International Version (NIV) 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Sumeet Govilkar	Freddie's look while they are discussing about we will rock you is completely wrong. At 1:23

Whatsina Name	I have high expectations for this movie based on the trailers. I hope I'm not disappointed.
Harmonie Vince	I feel like when I go and see this Oscar wining movie I’m gonna be the only 13 year old in the movie theatres
HUN Aviation	can a trailer get an OSCAR?
The Great Player	How many more Galileo's do you want? 😂
Thevaakiran Raj	Goosebumps
HaRmLeSs PaRaSiTe	From 2:15 to the end of the trailer. In Those seconds I got shiver. Cause that actually happened ♡♡♡ A thing that I ve never watched in my entire life. Today No group is like Queen. Queen and Freddy Forever
Rosetta Stabile	The chills are too real
jmrbug 96	Rami Malek looks so identical to Freddy Mercury with the moustache and everything! And his little movements on the stage, the kind of "Dandy pants" swing around and bend around kinda stuff, is spot on like Freddy Mercury did on stage. Other Queen fans know what I mean, and if you don't, I'm assigning you homework of studying up on every Queen video/song before November hits us.
martinforsell89	Ha! Check out 2:15 , the clapping  is totally of with the music
Default Dude	Wasn't Sacha Baron Cohen making a movie about Queen?
Bart Kerkhof	2 months left guys
Cine Paraiso	My only complaint is... 1:24 We will rock you in the eighties? What the...
deano connors	The casting in this looks spot on. Brian May's character looks and sounds just like him, as does Freddies. I was outside that concert depicted in the movie. Couldn't get in as it was too packed and we all left it too late to get there. But we could hear it outside and thousands of us were outside the terraces drinking singing and dancing along to it all.
brianno27	the person who did this trailer needs a pay rise! goosebumps baby!! oscar winning trailer.
Dan was here	I’m watching it at montreux where Freddie used to live
QuickCinema	I really hope the transition into the third act (Freddie battling AIDS) Is the Live Aid Performance and they show the whole twenty minutes of it
Claim	Неужели реально годный фильм будет?
brandname1967	horrible actor
Isa Salazar	Bet people are gonna be singing the songs in the movie theater 😂
Caden Morris	Now that Disney is gonna own Fox,Freddie is gonna be my Favorite Disney Princess / *Queen* !!! 👨🏻 👑
Cloaks	Its the first movie of 2018 that has no crappy pop songs.
Siel Music	Hay errores cronológicos graves que se aprecian en los trailers. Freddie no tenía bigotes ni cabello corto cuando hicieron We Will Rock You en 1977. Es una pena que se cometan errores evitables en una producción tan importante.
《You are the cause of my euphoria》	Estoy enamorada de este trailer❤

Yow Honey	Rami Malek? My baby?
Freddie Ellis	Calling the film Bohemian Rhapsody feels so cheap!   Why wouldn’t you call it Show Must Go On or The Miracle or A Kind of Magic????
Tailah	Looool Littlefinger
Nikyta Miersanni	🔴 *Bohemian Rhapsody* now available [ t.co/Lgr8KMvtWT ]  A chronicle of the years leading up to Queen's legendary appearance at the Live Aid (1985) concert.  Unglaublicher film! Sehr zu empfehlen, es auszuprobieren!
YodaEconomics	For once an American plays the Brit, instead of the other way around.
johno4521	Sorry but I can't take "Freddie" seriously with those joke shop teeth & tash. He did not look like that in '77 when 'We Will Rock You' came out.
Mia Torres	Okay but the first 30 seconds are absolutely everything
Las Perlas TV	rip freddy
Aditya Gaikwad	AN ABSOLUTE GOD!!
Chrissy Hill	I got emotional watching this anyone else?
Stephanie A' Harris	I was born in November... And he died on my birthday, in the year I was pregnant with my firstborn...

Tejashree Shinde	Can't wait
Emely Sanchez	Gave me goosebumps
Mohamed Shaker	I’m really really excited with Bohemian Rhapsody movie, the trailers are fantastic!   But one fact that pissed me off is...in the second trailer, we see Brian May talking with Freddie Mercury. He said, " I want to give the audience a song that they can perform ," and the iconic foot stomping and claps of We will Rock you was played while Brian was shown clapping and then they all began to clap   And Freddie said " What’s the lyrics ? " and the WE WILL WE WILL ROCK U came in... ...Nothing seemed wrong yet until I saw Freddie’s look which was short hair and mustache!!! We will rock you was released in 1977 in the album NEWS of the World...   Freddie’s Short Hair was in 1980   So we’re seeing 1980’s Freddie talking about making a song in 1977! I think they should change this mistake in time  ( Some people say they’re talking about Radio Gaga~ But we’re seeing the foot-stomps and claps and they’re playing We will rock you ! So it can’t be Radio Gaga !! )
Yash Dubey	Loved the trailer , Can't wait to see this movie .
Merari Serrano	As I am 17 and Queen is WAY before my time  I LOVE THEM!!!  Their music is legend and will always be apart of me.

Shweta Saila	Wasn't he a white man? Then why isn't a white man playing his part? What if a white actor or actress plays a black character or if they sport dreadlocks or make their faces black with makeup? You guys will hate their guts! So much for equality and proper representation!! This is reverse cultural appropriation.
Daniel Lam	1.4k people thinks Bieber a better singer than Freddie?   Hahaha
Ramy Mouslim	At first I was sceptical about the choice of actor but now that I watched the trailer I gotta say that the ressemblance between Rami and Freddie is uncanny ..

akino darrell	Had no idea this movie was being made. Glad I read that one comment
Jason Lowry	This is My Generations version of the Doors and many more that came to pass.  If you grew up with Album covers on vinyl, you would know!  Art sold and music was strong!  Music was just that back then, Pure soul & Artform! Freddy Mercury was a musical saint, they still chant his words at events!  May god bless this film!
Aditya Muslim	Give the Oscar to Rami Malek please.
Paul Colson	I would watch this Movie because I am a huge fan of Queen and Freddie Mercury but the actor they chose to play Freddie Mercury was a poor choice ... Why didn't they just get that guy Raúl Juliá from the Adams Family to play Freddie lol I mean he looks like Gomez Adams from The Adams Family... It's an insult really.

Well nas	I wonder what happened after 01:17 scene???
Nathan Shietze	Th most beautiful thing about this is it introduces Queen to a newer generation as well. People underestimate how influential Queen was for the time for rock. They had every odd against them, radio stations and studios turning them down left and right, people bashing and hating on them for sexuality reasons, and yet here we are....they gave the world a middle finger and said stop us. Now we can’t turn on a rock station or go to a sporting event without hearing one of their songs and that’s beautiful

(goodnight we love you) he walks off stage. all of them smiling , the crowd is smiling, and it see a  aerial shot of  Wembley Stadium.170,000 people chanting clapping. and it's saying in white letters.1.5 billion people in 110 countries watched it via a live television stream from 13 satellites. Estimates of their record sales range from 150 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Queen received the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990. Queen greatest hits is one of the world best selling records of all time. world wide considered one of the greatest rook band of all time. Freddie mercury is considered by most if not the best one of the greatest singers of all time. and then it's says in white letters 1991      it's the black and white music video for these are the days of our lives. and you see sick Freddie. and in white letters it says Freddie mercury died in his garden lodge home by his friends in November 24 1991. and you see him sings a bit of the song and as the song builds up. when he rocks his head by and just before he says i love you it match  cut's to a similar  shots of his face in the keep yourself alive music. and he's young and healthy. and in the middle of the music video you see insert shots of the beginning of some of there familiar  music videos,. like don't stop me now and the live aid shows and the killer queen music video and the we are the champions music videos. and the bohemian rhapsody music video and the Hyde park shows and the songs like don't stop me now another one bites the dust. and we are the champions and all of the songs and bohemian rhapsody . the songs starts to mix and there also starts of record sales. and millions of queen fans . and people at the Adam Lambert shows' and just how love queen is today. and in middle it's starts to mix with seeing Rami and Freddie .  and the real music videos mix with the face movie music videos and the real live aid. and ;pictures of like Paul printer. and Freddie's friends. and the great pretender music videos . and the ending is just mixed with live shows and music videos and pictures of the movies and real life and it's and with . a mix of all of the end of Freddie's music videos . that would be awesome

Adam Tatti	Even my goosebumps got tears. Can’t wait.
Sarun Kotte	You might aswell  have casted Freddie Mercury a black guy ! Freddie (Farrokh Bulsara) is 100% Indian born to Gujrati parents for god sake, why a white dude playing his role ?
pavan junaid	they should remove the dislike button for this trailer...
God king Jack Lee	I smell #1 at the box office
Xenon VH2	Hi, 20th Century Fox. I was wondering what is the Age rating for this film is, Because i don't want to repeat what happened to me during "Deadpool"... I was rejected at the theatre because i was too young (i was 12 at the time, i didn't know the age rating for it) to watch it. So could you tell me what the age rating is? Me and my friends are looking forward into watching this movie together. Thank you.

brian sinnott	by far the saddest part of this  movie when it comes out is when freddy is dying
47 and2	saw them live in the late 70s. great concert. Check out the Live FAST performance of we will rock you. They opened with this. It rocks. and i know some people like the slow studio version better, but they still played that live also. they ended their concerts with that.  https://youtu.be/LGBUJL5uS_c

Utkarsh Bhasme	I didn't know that Freddie was from Parsi family and had childhood in India
ALLSTAR284	Really hope they showcase some of the other 20+  hits by queen other than just those 3
Suzanne-Abigail Claxton	I live with my husband and brother and they BOTH sent me this link because they know my OBSESSION with Queen & Freddie. I pray to God they do the band and Freddie justice and it isn't cheesy and I'm curious as to how they will end this considering how Freddie died, John retired and so on. This is a big risk, like Queen in the beginning, and I hope it works out just like Queen did (and still does - Adam Lambert is doing alright considering that he's standing in for a Legend).

gregory cobbler	*goosebumps*
Queen & David Bowie Chat Shows	Oh no, what a joke I was enjoying it until the bit where Brian is explaining how he wants to give the audience something to do during We Will Rock You, then Freddie asks "what's the lyric? " Freddie DID NOT have a moustache in 1977 or hair that short and wearing a tshirt from the Hot Space era ....so much for accuracy :(

Elin Diamond	should've been robert james-collier
Alonso Natividad	I listened to a Queen's song for the first time in 1980, when I was 12. Another One Bites the Dust was a hit on the radio, so, I saved my allowance money and went to a music store to buy "The Game" cassette tape (I only had a tape player back then) but, the music store owner (bless his soul) suggested me to get the "Greatest Hits" tape instead, since I was new to Queen's music. The moment "Bohemian Rhapsody" started playing in my old boombox, my life changed forever.
Xronze	I'm only 11 years old and I love Queen so much yes

Emily Zhang	Why do I see Brandon Rogers?
mike ggg	Congratulations people you have been completely duped. They have hetero washed his movie completely. If you go and see it, you will be giving your money to the theater, and they will laugh all the way to the bank. Look at the trailers. Listen to those who have actually seen it. They focus his love interest on those females. They made one passing interest in having slept with a man after being drunk. How nice of them to put that in
Eric Littlejohn	ABSOLUTLY BRAVO to the lead editor of this trailer.... unbelievable. Best I've ever seen by far.
Karla	Can it be November 2nd already !!!!!

DIAMBIS	Check out the debut video from DIAMBIS! https://youtu.be/-yRe_7uKOzs
Anna Michele	🔴 *Bohemian Rhapsody film 2018* #now available [ bit.ly/2L6bi2l ]  “Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?” Freddie Mercury sings in the title track of the film “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
Anton Prest	This is absolutely anticipated.Just want to make an observation though.This guy who is impersonating Freddie doesn't seem to do him justice,physically or charisma wise.Mercury was a bigger than life persona(thus charismatic), and was much taller than this dude..Don't hate my comment. Just an observation. And yes I understand that it's absolutely impossible to portray someone 100% convincingly,but I think they should had tried harder..
Alli Cera	If Ben Stiller was younger,  I think he could also be great for this role.
Anupam Shekhar	Farrokh Bulsara (Freddie Mercury) was born and grew up in Zanzibar, Tanzania. At 10 he was sent to a boarding school in Bombay and moved to England at 17. He never acknowledged either his African or Indian nationality or his known associates from both the nations. I don't think they'll ever portray this in the movie, despite calling it "his story."
Jerry Rupprecht	I preferred the other trailer
Mirella Kayali	*Goosebumps*
Cameron Cyr	Am I the only one that noticed the Freddie has his 80s hair style when they introduce we will rock you, that song come out in the late 70s

Anisa Ashoffi	I think it's that real freedie
luis ambriz	A alguien más le dio un profundo hedor a OSCAR mientras veía este trailer ??...... bestial adaptación  de uno de los 4 dioses de la música reciente ..... MERCURY, PRESLEY , LENNON y JACKSON
PowerKnight	dope
Marcell Franc	This is Bullsh*t...    you know that the concert in london is more crowded than that... its more than full seat!!
Payule	This movie makes me want to learn how to play the piano
The Cowboy	Looks nothing like Freddie Mercury.
rieyuki	Lots of Sacha Baron Cohen fans still arguing he would have been a better Freddie.  It's pointless to argue and try to change their minds - respect their opinions and move on.  Whether Cohen would have delivered a better acting performance than Malek in playing a believable Freddie, we may never know, but read these comments from the band members (google the quotes below to find the article, I'm not making this up):  *May, in an interview with Classic Rock magazine, also talked about why Cohen and the project parted company: "We [the band] felt that his presence in the movie would be very distracting," referencing the star's "outstanding performances in The Dictator, Les Miserables and Hugo as being "very much Sacha Baron Cohen performances."*  *Said May: "And we thought there has to be no distraction in the Freddie movie. You have to really suspend that disbelief. The man who plays Freddie -- you have to really believe is Freddie. And we didn't feel that could really happen with Sacha."*  Casting opinions from the band members themselves carry more weight than anybody else, yes? They've seen Cohen audition as Freddie, we haven't.  They personally knew Freddie, we didn't.  They know what works for them as Queen.  They are more qualified than anybody here to determine whether actor A, B, or C would be compelling as Freddie.  Let's just enjoy the movie in its entirety and argue less about who is playing Freddie.  If the movie is as amazing as these two trailers were, this movie will be huge!  It will be a movie that does justice to Queen.  It will be a movie that does justice to Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon... all of them at the same time!  This is the story of a graphic designer (who designed the "Queen crest", with an uncanny ability to engage an entire concert audience), an aspiring astrophysicist (who later returned and completed the PhD in 2007), an aspiring dentist (who was asked back in 1970 by Peter Gabriel to join Genesis but declined, paving the way for Phil Collins' career in Genesis), and an electrical engineer (who created the iconic Deacy Amp for Brian May's guitar sounds).    The story of Queen is amazing, yet tragic, yet inspring in the end, and I can't wait to see the movie!
Julie Strauss	Can’t wait!!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻

Steve Starman	I may be old, but I got to see all of the cool bands. I saw Queen with Freddie 3 times. If you get a chance to see Queen with Adam Lambert go see them. Adam is no Freddie, but hes very good, and the closet thing you'll get to seeing the original Queen. The movie looks great...
Milly Lessin	It was only until now that I realized that I need all the Queen songs in one...help I’m addicted again

Haunting Spook	Finally! A movie other than Disney that looks good enough to watch in theaters

Maggie x	Yes!!!
zip Zieller	When this is publish to cinema? I cant wait to see. Btw im from Malaysia, sorry for my poor english
Maria Spin	I'm just nitpicking here, but I don't think the band would be surprised by Freddie's "operetic section" because they did similar songs in their earlier albums. Anyway I'm hyped for the movie and I hope it'll make it to the theater near me, I'm not sure though cause I live in a small city.
logan	already getting a over dramatic vibe. hopefully they stay true to the real story

Joe Bob	Boring
Samantha G.	I saw a lot of people upset when the first trailer came out because they thought the movie was going to ignore Freddie’s queer identity/experience, and I’m hoping those people will see this trailer and actually give the movie a chance.
Aoi Dragneel nanana	The only thing i regret is not being born in the time of their prime. I missed a legendary piece of history
Sagar Srivastava	Freddie Mercury is a phenomenon. And I am pretty sure this film will do correct justice to it.
Hillary Marek	No one can sit expressionless and just quietly listen to we are the champions or Bohemian rhapsody....it can't be done. You just react to them. It's basic and primal and something that can't be contained.....just like the men who created them.
Mountain Films	This actually looks good
Bruhhh 77	Is this real life
unbeatible459	Here before 10 mil views
ChoCoNaT	I NEED THAT MIXED SONG NOW ON SPOTIFY

Delmore theywantedmetoputalastname	All really nice but I haven’t heard The Show Must Go On in this trailer n I swear if it’s not in the movie I’m suing

Elietta Said	Loved this!!! I would really appreciate if any of you wouldn’t mind to check out my channel! Im a small channel. Thank you and have a wonderful day! I just did Bohemian Rhapsody on the piano!
ipKonfig.com	Rami Malek is a perfect cast, always loved his acting abilities. Not a fan of Queen and "rock you" is so overly played in sports, so much that it makes me puke my guts out... but should be a good movie of Freddy and the band!
cabinetflame	you are a legend fred?  MOTHERFUCKING GOD YOU MEAN!!!
Jack Harris	F
Phrog Chief	Epic.  Can't wait.
Nick	Can't buy the actor as Freddie. Feels like he's a better fit as a young Mick Jagger type

Kurumi Senpie	*MAAAMAAAAA*

Your everyday weaboo	I know what I gonna see
Stephanie Marie	I hope they dont butcher his legacy, It better be good
Gavin West '22	Someone has to do a movie on Guns N Roses so much behind that band
RandomTv	Great trailer, kinda wish that Sacha  Baron Cohen kept the role though.
MayormenteLibros	Takashi shirogane confirmed not straight and this bisexual Freddy has made this day so much better. Thank u kweens
Brian Smith	Gah. Worst trend in music, EVER,  is this stupid mash-up of three or four different songs. Radio stations are doing it now, different songs by different artists. Note to perpetrators---you are NOT making it better, the songs do NOT benefit from your basement-mix meddling, we are NOT ENTERTAINED. For the love of all that's holy, STOP THIS!!!
Grace & Things	I am SO FRICKEN EXCITED FOR THIS!! This is gonna be one of the best movies ever...
BucketHead 360	I’m so excited for this!!!!!

Tammy Peck	Breaks my heart when he says "what if I don't have time?" Oh Freddie 😞

Zach&Hannah M.	The feels?! From a trailer....aight...bet.
Jesse Cab	Rami absolutely is looking amazing so far! I think Cohen just looks like him but I think rami is a much better actor with a much better resume.
David Hampson	They messed up the Wembley scene at the end.  Everyone clapping simultaneous, but sound doesn't work that way. https://imgur.com/gallery/2iwAd5q  I hope they can fix this computer generated audience.
Patrick Arellano	They better not kill him halfway though the film like Brian May said they would.
Mike Elwell	Just show me where to pre-order the 4K Ultra HD Super Deluxe Steelbook Extended Director's Complete Edition and I'll pay them in blood.
n2ziastka	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYEEEEESSSS!
WinnieDarling	nothing but respect for MY Desi Queer Icon
thunder bolt	Rami Malek isn't doing it for me on this one. Hopefully his acting will pull him through but he doesn't have the look of Mercury...I mean not even close. Val Kilmer probably was the best in that Doors movie.
KING	Until dawn character?
treasure toast	Finally a movie about THE bisexual icon ❤
1402 News	Beautiful. Even if this is rated R, I'm going to see it with my family.
Yeppe	Edberg VS Cyanide         THE MOVIE

Cosmo	So Oscars hype then?
Just Trolling	Sacha Baron Cohen would have been a better Freddie.
BabyBoomerChannel	I don’t believe you can tell Queen’s story without understanding the 1970’s.   Freddie Mercury, Studio 54, Times Square, graffiti, racial tension, Jimmy Carter.   But maybe I’m wrong. We’ll see.
ebatton56	I hope that they made him explicitly bisexual because no straight person could ever be that level of iconic
Izzy Suleiman	I can't wait that long
Nonya Business	*Roger, there's only room in this band for **_one_** hysterical queen*

Phenom Enol	if they focus on the band, their artistry, their history, and the lead singers amazing vocal range then i cannot wait to see it.
What Could It Bee?	I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
moonlightdriver800	Elliot Alderson hacked Freddy Mercury!
unionjack515	Looks like it belongs on VH-1 with The Temptations.  Brian May has done EVERYTHING BUT respect the legacy of Queen.  Bringing in Paul Rodgers and the American Idol kid, then continuing on without John Deacon, despite the fact that he’s still alive.  Sorry, not a fan.  I’d rather just listen to the REAL Queen.
Gama lie . ENTONCES	Que  no  me  ha  dado  por  lo  tanto  el .  El  tema  del  foro  😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆

Matthew Eats.	I can't stop looking at his mouth lol
John Basher	Wow amazing! and I can't believe they got Freddie Mercury to play himself in the movie! He's hardly aged!!
Eric Kennedy	Wish they would have kept Sacha as Freddie Mercury...
Sean Bean	I was so taken by Rami Malek's portrayal in the first trailer, but now I'm noticing the guy who's playing Brian May has the speaking voice down. The only one who looks a bit too handsome is Roger Taylor.  I don't know how many actors are that short with a head that large though....
Coup0705	The Freddie Mercury Story Who Wants To Live Forever looks better.
andrew dunsmore	Looks like a boring, shitty movie. Bohemian Rhapsody is an over played snooze fest.

Pandagirl101 Panda	Me and my dad wanna watch this :D so coooooooool

斎藤大明	お あ  ーや
___Kicking_and_Screaming ___	He is a good actor. And looks like Freddy Mercury
Darryl Willett	Can you say OSCAR?
Operation NOPE!	Apparently people haven't learnt from the suicide squad trailer that just putting in queen music in a trailer doesn't mean the film is going to be good. This looks like another safe, by the numbers biographical film, I mean, they literally fired Sacha Baron Cohen because he didn't toe their line.
Ticaro Kabrit	Music of my youth, we are all now in our mid fifties...but we still rock on
WasteOfSpace :P	AHHH CANT WAITTT

john croissante	CRYING
DeeYvette Dino	I LOVE YOU FREDDY MERCURY, FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😢

C18	I knew that was Rami Malek
Nick G	Sacha shouldve done it
Josean Paolo Ombria	I am crying on the trailer what more if watch the whole movie...can't wait for this.
Bec	Whilst I'm really looking forward to the film, I feel as if this trailer suggests the film focuses more on Brian May and Roger Taylor, whilst neglecting John Deacon. I mean, John only appears at the briefest moments and we literally never hear him speak, either in the teaser trailer or this one. Whereas, Brian is shown in this really positive and dramatic light, showing how he had the idea for 'We Will Rock You'. Roger is shown as a drama queen but in a really funny way, and both he and Brian's positive relationship with Freddie is made obvious. It's sad because John was said to have had a close friendship with Freddie also, to the point where he did not carry on with Queen after Freddie died, because he felt Queen was not the same without him. I just hope that despite Brian and Roger's supposed fractured relationship with John, and with the pair of them being so involved in the making of this movie, that they can still include John's contribution to the band. Don't get me wrong, I love all the band members, I just hope it works s fair to all of them ☺
Celestia S	My dad used to listen to this song a lot, naturally I grew up listening to it. It was his favorite, not so surprising it is my favorite too. So excited for this movie. Great band, great albums, hopefully great movie.
Navin Kumar	BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY means?
Maddie Rube Vlogs	these are probably the best trailers ive seen in a while
Melissa H.	I don't know.  The story is probably good, but that lead....I'm just not buying him as Mercury.  At one point in the clip, he reminded me of a chihuahua!  Maybe I'm too big of a Mercury fan, but I think I'd rather just watch old Queen videos and read Freddie's biography than watch this movie.  But again, I'm on the fence here, so who knows.  At least his story is being told.
Pippa Walton	SO EXCITED PEOPLE CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING OMG
Victoria Lovey	So are we getting a mix of the music of this trailer

Collision Clan	BOOPS
Tank Dempsey	Posers be like "OMG QUEEN" and Iam like wtf is this
Truth Bytes	Looks great but I guess the makers are going to not even spent few seconds on his Indian roots and claim Farouk Bulsara  as a British person. I know Art and Music has no boundaries but your roots matter to make your story complete!

peabody66	This looks interesting but I personally don't think Rami Malek looks anything like the real Freddie Mercury. I might get flak for saying this but I think Rami Malek is too ugly to play Freddie Mercury.
Dank games	The greatest band, the most amazing singer.... first I was like "No!" ... than I was like "omg yes!"
MysticHydra	I hope this is good. Biopics are often saturated with formulaic cliches. Also, the filming of this film was riddled with interpersonal strife and dysfunction. But, I'm still holding out hope that it's awesome
Azeem Khwaja	wow didn't knew pablo escobar was also there 0:46

pieman	I want the music mix they used for this.
Avengers Assemble	Mark my words Rami Malek will win Best Actor in  a  Leading Role!
Jacob Merced	I’m the executive producer of this film, hopefully it does good at the box office
bellabana	Sacha Baron Cohen pulled out of playing Freddie just before they started filming because the guys from Queen wanted to make the movie all about ‘themselves’ rather than just Freddie himself. Cohen wanted it to be real & gritty instead now it’s a watered down PC version. Plus Rami Malek accent is wrong & he lacks Freddie’s charisma, this looks so bland!
Tea Moresealyo	Queen ❤

CJDavisMaine Music	Freddie looks and sounds absolutely perfect. So excited to see Lucy Boynton playing Mary Austin, as well— I hope her relationship with Freddie won't be overlooked, because she was the only woman he ever loved, and she was family to him and his bandmates.
Colin B	hahahahhahahhahahahha this guy looks absolutely nothing like Freddy Mercury man they messed up when they lost Sasha Cohen
Mokuujin	hackerman goes queer

Ella the Potterhead	I was once on a field trip and we were hiking it was night. We were talking about planets and stuff when the staff person asked us if we knew the person who invented the telescope was. Obviously, we knew it was Galileo. She asked what his last name was. People were like "Figaro" or however it is spelled in bohemian rhapsody. But obviously it's not his last name but I just thought that it was pretty funny 😂
Roxas4everjustin	Love the trailer and I’m so stoked for this movie but the fact that the stomping and clapping is off at the end of the trailer bothers me to no end

MrWhiteones	Sasha baron Cohen was supposed to play Freddie but Brian may didn’t like the fact that they wanted to make the movie about Freddie and not the band after Freddie died. Sasha as Freddie would’ve been amaze balls

Isaih Obrien	"We are the champions, of the world"    FALSE   Mandela effect: no such thing "as Of the world" in we are the champions.  Yeah, I'm that type of guy...
ej yehey	Galileo must be proud! ☝🏼
Tropical Dash	I never thought they would ever make a movie about a real life music band.
# GREENSMITH101	Oh my god these trailers just keep getting better!  Freddie  once  said "When I'm gone you can do anything with my  music.  Just don't make me  boring! " Well this is far from   boring! . I think  Freddie  would  approve.  God bless you Freddie! RIP
mrnncool02 noah	Not sure I agree with the choice of actor for this one...will have to see the movie

Daniela Stephani Lopez Duarte	Sweet baby I hope this isn’t a train wreck
Marylou Sakosky	Yes Freddie Mercury...We love you that much ''  Bravo...cannot wait to see the whole flick  ٩(-̮̮̃•̃)
Amy Lee	When Freddie said, "What if I don't have time?" :'(
Misty I	It’s interesting that they say “of the world” at the end of “We are the champions” in this movie.. but the actual band never uttered those words at the end of that song.. it’s a popular Mandela effect.. 😱
Narin Wolf	аввв💞ждала этот фильм очень давно благодаря каверу Bohemian Rhapsody от Panic! at the Disco 😍 Обязательно пойду на него с моей подругой (также по фандому) ^^
RusCus	I can heae the LGBT community freaking out now that this trailer didn't focus 100% on Freddie'a sexuality. Just like they freaked out over the teaser.
Koala	Yeah I'm gonna watch that... 7 times.
Ramisa Tora	I can see myself crying like a baby in the theatre

Kitty Kat 3969	They should of made the trailer 6 mins long.
Zul Izwan	wow
uToobBro777	They didn't create songs, they created HYMNS.
Pritesh Wadhwa	Its like a diamond for queen fans
Katrīne	This looks incredible
Dylan Wheeler	REVERSE MANDELA EFFECT: everyone remembers “We Are The Champions” ending with “of the wooorld” yet in the official song he actually only says it after the first chorus but not at the end. Interesting, because at the end of this trailer it sounds like the end of the song and they strongly emphasize “of the world”. That being said I can’t wait to see the movie and I really hope the full song is in it so we can know for sure! Also, Rami Malek is a wonderful actor so I have no doubt that he will absolutely give the legendary role it’s due respect!  Side side note...call it “coincidence” but for anyone who has watched Mr. Robot season 3, they show occasional short scenes of a “large hadron collider” which is what is said to be causing the Mandela Effects!!! Just sayin🤔
Genereic Lyrics	Mr.Robot

Some Random Boi	*GALILEO*
Mr.MadangLik	rami malek
Criminology 101	Freddy Mercury was born in a family of Zoroastrian Parsees in Zanzibar. He was raised in India and eventually his family immigrated again, this time to the UK. His real name as Farrokh Bulsara. It's a shame that he wasn't proud of his roots and felt a need to hide it. Perhaps due to the racism of that time. It's also said he was secretly a homosexual.
LyricalXilence	I take credit for 50% of the trailers 3million views.  :)

Manu Marquez	Catch me getting kicked out of the movie theatre for singing along to every single song
Phoenix Chastaine	Meh. Another film about a self destructive musician? That's a long list to pick from. Pity that the ones who DON'T destroy themselves aren't as interesting to producers.

Lord Voldemort	Sasha Baron Cohen would've been a better choice to play Freddie.
Aidan Stresing	I’m really hoping they put Killer Queen, Somebody to Love, and Good old fashioned lover boy in the movie instead of just the ones they put in the trailer. Not hating the other songs it’s just I like these ones better

Can I have 40 subs pls	Mistakes I spot so far. 1. Deacon looks off. 2. Freddie didn't have his iconic mustache or the short hair during the we will rock you song but in this trailer he did. 3. We are the champions have we will rock you beats? And we can see the audience clapping so don't say they just the music in. Still gonna see it though, looks good

BFKAnthony817	34 year old male here. I was born December 30th 1983. I am by definition a Millennial, just due to when I was born. I started school in 1989, at 5 and 1/2 years old due to my late birthday. But, I can assure you, I knew lots of the 80's actually, my earliest memories were during that formative time in my life. I experienced He-Man, Transformers, Back to the Future and so many other 80's and 90's icons growing up.   And yes, the first time I REALLY loved Queen, was when I was a young child and it was in Wayne's World in 1992, it became one of the coolest  bands I discovered as a child. My parents had grown up listening to classic rock, and as a teen in the mid to late 90's I was listening to classic rock my Dad loved from about the age of 13 or so. So yes, I am a Millennial, and I AM a life-long Queen fan.
Ashley Laws	I really hope this does as we'll as it looks. This production has had so many changes. I know that's life, and it happens, but I really hope this movie is a huge success.

KING NATION	Marc martel should have played the main part
Olivia Grace 2007	At my school concert we sang 3 queen songs
Kingjiimmy	You’re a legend Fred
ScienceWinsEveryTime	They're going to fix the Live Aid audience at the end, right? You don't clap twice and then open your arms on We Will Rock You, you stomp twice and clap once. Is that a real mistake? Like, that's something that happens over hours of CGI work, and nobody catches that? Not even while they're syncing up the timing with the song, does it dawn on them that they're seeing claps but hearing feet stomping?  ...ok.
Brian Koski	I bet Trump hates it.  Sad.

Druutilite	This is a wonderful idea, but I hope to god this isn't another Mamma Mia in execution. Don't get me wrong, I love this band, but it might not work if all the songs are hamfisted in and abrupt. Also, if this is a musical, there's a major problem.  Singing out-of-plot (Like a lot of the songs in Mamma Mia) can work out with musicals, and it makes sense. They all suddenly sing, everyone can magically dance. I won't comment on the logistics of it all. But there are problems when you mix this with a band. Is the band singing IN the movie half the time or are they singing out of plot? Are we hearing a real performance that they're supposedly putting on, or are we hearing a classic out-of-plot song, and the setting of said song is in a concert hall?  This sounds dumb, yes, why would they be performing an out-of-plot song if they're a band in a movie? Well there are many ways this can happen.  Think back to The Greatest Showman, Never Enough. It was a generic pop song in a time when two people couldn't date if they were different races. I hope this movie doesn't do anything similar to that, but that's just one example of a mix up. That song, Never Enough, was being performed, but the question is, was it actually pop in the plot? Was the song she was singing just turned into pop for us to enjoy it? If it were pop in that time frame, it would not have worked at all. It was a very strange mix up.  What if there's a moment in this movie where they're not at a performance, but just at an event or something, and they start playing a song. Everyone dances, etc etc. Are we meant to believe that's a part of the plot, or it's just another song shoved in? It might just get confusing! Either way, I'll still watch this movie, just wanted to bring that up.

No One	*AAAAAAAAAAAAA*
ReiMourr Power	All you hysterical queens can relax;  the movie will not brush over Freddie's lifestyle & orientation.

Ethan Muncy	If you're gonna make a movie called Bohemiam Rhaspody, make it about a poor boy growing up in the streets. Who gets into crime and ends up killing a man. Where he thens confesses it to his mother, and goes on the run shortly before being captured, and found guilty. The last part of the movie would be him facing his ultimate doom as the date of his execution nears. But this looks fantastic too.
JESUS'S MOM	Im so excited for this film , it looks amazing . I would watch it 32 times if I wanted to.

Regina Fowler	RIP Freddie. I'm sure whatever movie they do of you, they'll try and do you justice. Nothing like the real thing though, we just love you so much, we're not willing to let you go. Someone has to 'play' you and whomever they pick, we'll love because we can't let you go......You're you in spirit....and we cry at the sight of you, we cry at the audio and we simply...because you're not here....we cry because we love you and we'll always love you....that will never change.

jncrlsyb	Freddie looks hella retarded
Rolando Duque	Únicas y detergentes en 3...2...1 :v
wuta beatnik	Think this will be a good movie yes but really unrealistic. Freddie didn’t really fight with anyone in the band, half the time it was Between Roger and Brian. Plus the trailer kinda made it seem like it was Brian’s idea to experiment with sound and stuff but in real like Freddie was really a big part in experimenting with the songs and stuff. I really hope there’s more in the movie though I want it to be really good and respectful to the late Freddie Mercury

Erik B.	Little mistake: We Will Rock You was released by the band in the 1970s, couple of years before Freddie cut his hair and grew a moustache.
Rebel Fandoms	Its a shame kids these days won't know what good music is
IamVexar	Looks like this movie is gonna rock us!
cubedmack	Before Freddy past he and Michael Jackson were going to do a song together.  Would have been great to hear on a song together.
Blame	I don't think Rami looks similar enough to represent Freddie in the movie.
Lego Ultimate1	Hope this is accurate.

NintendoWolf	I never knew I wanted a combination of all queen songs into one until this trailer.
Allan Pedersen	I've been looking a lot at the audience at the end shot.. cause I'm a nerd. I can't figure out if they are just copied or also CGI.  They for sure are copied, theres the same long haired guy in a striped white and black shirt several places and overweight woman in a purple shirt.  But I can't tell if they are actually real people. if I was to make a suggestion I would have made several of them hold beverages. Looks weird an entire stadium full of people and not a single beer.
MolaxageaGamez	why didn’t you just put the original song in like smh

CM ONHITME	i like how that left out all fact of freddies personal life- what they really should have done was left out the part about howthey were in a band called queen -  this way we will all get a movie about about strangers who do nothing - or who do nothingeven remotely interesting or exciting.  This is great!!!!!!  God awful casting choice - that is, unless The Merc was eqyptian.

Irina Strih	The legend. Amazing.
Troy Anderson	🔊.    REPENT of yo SINS ... All must repent from sin to enter the kingdom of God.   "JESUS"  Is the narrow road least taken, the ONLY way to the father in Heaven...                God loves you ❤

Gannicus TV	So I did read that the movie really only covers from the formation of Queen to the Live Aid Performance. Does that "what if I don't have time" line signify that it might go all the way the The Days of our Lives era??
Sydney Unstoppable	Yaaaay! The gods
Lexi Xoxo	Go follow G & A Crafts they have amazing vids
Miguel de la vega	Sacha Baron Cohen said he tried to make a film based on Freddie and all the crazy things he went through behind the scenes, but he couldn't because Queen's surviving band mates wanted the film to focus on them instead and how they continued on after Freddie died. that's like making a movie about the Jackson 5 and how Tito, Jermaine, and the rest of the brothers continued on with their careers after Michael died. no one wants to see that. this trailer seems like Freddie's the focus of the movie after all but trailers can be very misleading
NICKY D	Firstly, this looks AWESOME!  Also, am I wrong in saying that Freddie didn’t have the mustache when they wrote We Will Rock You
suddendee	Heck, I’ll watch this for the music alone!  🥁🎸🎻🎤🎸🎧🎼

CineMarioAlcalá CMA	I've seen other movies when the actor for the main caracther didn't look similar to person in real life Joseph Fiennes-Michael Jackson John Wayne-Genghis Khan but with Freddy Mercury this actor doesn't anything similar He seems ridiculous I couldn't take this movie seriously. It's a Shame.

Alfredo Durán	How whores choose an actor who has no resemblance to the great Freddy Mercury? It is so unpleasant, it is something disgusting, exaggerated and very, very badly achieved. Freddy Mercury that I remember did not have eyes as big as if he has this wrong actor. What a pity they have chosen this actor, has no presence with this acting role, imitating the great Freddy Mercury, I said, period! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️👎🏻💩😷

David Jimenez	I've been a hip hop head my whole life, my dad not so much. He grew up on rock, and I never cared for rock. But I remember him putting me on to Queen when I was a teenager and I instantly fell in love with Queen. They've been my favorite band since my dad put me on to them. My dad has no idea this movie is coming out. I can't wait to show him this trailer and hopefully see it with him when it comes out.

Thibault Lbs	And the Oscar goes to..... RAMI MALEK
XxTheJimsterxX	I’m so hyped for it; that’s dangerous though. Films like this have the potential to just be “okay”, especially when they’re this level of anticipated. But come on, the actor Rami Malek looks SO much like Freddie that it’s scary. From what I’ve seen with the first two trailers, he seems to capture his mannerisms extremely well, too. I think this film’s going to be amazing.

Diplume	this proves that the song did originally have “of the world” at the end of the song and the Mandela affect was trying to remove it. BUT IT FAILED HA! this makes me think that the Mandela affect is like something that is existing right now as an organism or something and is trying so hard to erase some things out of existence.. 😐🤭
DeepSpaceBass1	I hope this is more a movie about his music career than his personal life, no need to make a movie about the sexual lifestyle that killed freddie when he made so much great art.

Jesus The Frog	I've watched this so many times.
Peter Huisman	Okay so for the two trailers Rami gives quite an impressive performance. I still like to see more to judge him in full (for instance Freddy’s voice had more falsetto when he talked, Rami is a bit lower) but I think he is a great actor to play Freddy!!
RonJon	Not trying to be an SJW or anything (which I apologize if it seems like I am), but I really hope this film is able to capture more of Freddie’s homosexual life... There’ve only been a couple small scenes in these trailers showing this off, which is a bit strange considering that his homosexual lifestyle was what made Freddie Mercury *Freddie Mercury...* I just really hope that there are more scenes in the actual movie that show off these important aspects, but so far, the overall movie looks *FANTASTIC....*
The ATUAHENE Family	I just reached 15k subscribers! Yay me 😂😁
Sarah Grace	I was very scared this movie was going to skip over his AIDS affliction and his bisexuality. Good to see it will also be in the film
Frances Delano	They just dont make them like that anymore. Makes you wonder why all the greatest rock bands came out of 60s and 70s........It was truly an age of legends no artist today could even come close too or even measure too. That time in music is gone just like the original composers of classical music. It was once in a lifetime.

Pan CM	Rami Malek & Co. may have given all they could but growing up admiring Freddie and the band performing this truly one-of-a-kind musical experience I just can't help but feel the movie falls far short. Perhaps this was one of the reasons nobody had the guts to make a movie about their lives, not to mention their musical performances until now.

Mozart Valdez	Hey planet Earth 👽👾 I need your help... If you like feel good edm music then you might wanna read this... When life gets rough there's always that one thing we as humans can go back to and feel like everything is alright. In my opinion that thing is good music. There have been so many days before when I was younger where everything seemed so overwhelmingly negative... Like there was no light at the end of my tunnel. But then I started listening to my idols, marshmello and zedd included, and somehow it made me feel some sort of way... Almost like a hope entered into my life. At that moment I knew what my dream in life was.   I wanted to make music like my favorite artists. I knew I'd never be able to even afford a keyboard so it stayed a dream, buried deep inside me never to see the light of day. Until now that is. Here I am  few years later and I'm making the music I'd always look for but never could find. This journey in my life has been amazing... And I want to help people feel the same way by listening to the music I create... I wanna be able to make memories for other people. I want people to hear my music and let it change your day for the better! That's why I started making music. 🌌They're not your typical dance tracks. My songs are flooded with emotion and vibes.   They're very spacey and futuristic. They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger, almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy... I'm not trying to boast. I'm just trying to help you all feel good vibes. And in 2018, I think alot more people need that. If you could help me out by checking my songs it would mean so much. I promise you won't regret it.

Johnny Loves Steel Balls	Is that the real Freddie? I thought he died
Charlie McCarthy	1:21 Am I the only one immensely bugged by the fact that this is the moment where they think up of “We Will Rock You” which should take place around 1977 but Freddie has the 1980’s mustache?

With a love of film and music, the fact I get to see a film by one of the greatest bands of all time is amazing, and the fact that The Dirt (about Motley Crue) is also coming gives me excitement that more films about rock and metal groups will come in the future.

Racer Hex	You see great trailers everyday 🎥🎬

bella rose	CHILLS. I've been waiting for this movie since it was released, and since that on director quit I was worried that it was gonna be a mess going in all different directions, but this looks amazing. and idc that he doesn't look like Freddie enough until he has the moustache, it's all about if he can deliver the charisma and personality of our gem

The Velvet Lounge	I hope it's good - regardless the music, the music!
libra085	Sacha (or Borat) is the closest looking one to Freddie. Rami is the second closest. I guess I'll forever be curious to what Sacha would've done. Also, it would've been confusing, funny and amazing at the same time because I would've been in awe at his performance while thinking of Borat.

I brought Freddie Mercury's biography a few years ago because all of I sudden I became obsessed with him and even more when I found out he died on my 20th birthday. Now he and my man (Prince) are together in the same vein. If it's in God's will and I see November 2nd, I will be seeing this in theaters. Can't believe it took so many years to tell Freddie/Queen's story. But better late than never.
potato potato	i have the feeling im going to be bawling my eyes out

joe rock in	i enjoy all the music in this trailer..
Thomas Christopher White	I know the attention is all on Rami for this one... But can I just say that they've cast the rest of the band extremely well.. I mean this is right up there with Straight Outta Compton. I hope it's as good of a movie.

LoveSong87	This looks amazing! While Sasha Baron Cohen looks like Freddie, I don’t think he would’ve been able to pulled off this role. Rami Malek is a great choice!
Delaney W.	anybody else here finna start crying
FRUIT WARRIOR	Yesss
Hudson Navarro	Looks amazing. Cannot wait.
Faizah H	Goosebumps! 💙💙💙

vale mmm	❤ no puedo creer que tengo que seguir esperando para poder verla ❤😭😭
Iskander FateRed	And now I’m crying! This looks amazing!
aviduser1961	For those of us that got to experience Queen in their time, I doubt this film will satisfy. Bio-pics rarely do. How can you cover a person's life in 2 hours? My only hope is that the film will spend as much time examining the history of the band as it will Freddie's sensationalistic lifestyle. I do look forward to the yet to be produced definitive Queen documentary.
Adam McClendon	...Instant Oscar
Fred Grady	Want to feel old? The role of John Deacon is played by Joseph Mazzello the kid who was Tim in the first and second Jurassic Park film.
Joe Whitehead	If he asked him to sing “Galileo” that many times, I can’t even imagine how long it took to make that song
Brionyx	Peter beale seems to be doing well

Liz Jimenez	Please 20th Century Fox, PLEASE... Give me a John Deacon moment, i want hear his voice... Please, for the last trailer <3
Fernando Férrer	Algum Br por aqui ?
MalX DBarrel	I CANT FREAKING WAIT  im serious actually...
JPablo 0125	Que pedazo de Trailer❤ Pero no sé si alguien más se dió cuenta (min 1:20) que en la parte en la que graban We will rock you el estilo de Freddie es el de los 80's, siendo que el álbum de la canción, el News of the world, salió en 1977 y el estilo de Freddie claramente era otro, esto me asusta porque no se ve tan fiel a la realidad, espero sea el único error :(
Fer Lopez	Ready, Freddie? LET'S DO IT.❤❤❤
Mario Diaz Granados	:'3

Tim Miller	Not buying it, that dude looks nothing like Freddie. This is a queen move for millennials. Horrible, jus horrible. Sorry.
Amy Kruger	Freddie will rock us again  :)
Marie Cervantes	Those 87 people absolutely have no taste in music.
Jacob Smith	"Mark my words no one will play Queen" that's just lazy writing
Dawn Mullen	I can't freakin' wait!
thecanveyboy	This looks soooo freakin’ awesome! Someone else on here mentioned a huge continuity mistake though. When Brian starts talking about a new song for the audience and it’s We Will Rock You, Freddie has a moustache in that scene but he didn’t grow that until the 80s and WWRY was written in the 70s before he had a moustache! still looks and sounds incredible though!!
Michael T	OMG! He's REALLY Freddie!
Nacho Morfeo	Rami looks well (even with the clear height difference) . Anyone wondering about the Sasha Baron Cohen version?
Hakudan2	This looks GOOD
Racquel Hall	I want to watch it NOW
Dil pickle	I'm so fuckin ready for this
belal khattab	A new Egyptian king is rising lol
c K	Have to watch this there should be a cartoon series about Queen to teach young kids about musical history and art as nowadays all we get is plastic crap .
Hope Varnedoe	Queen is my favorite of all time. This looks brilliant. I can't wait.
Karin A. Hernández silva	Oh god😍😍
lena innuendo	Freddie didn`t have a moustache when Brian wrote We will rock you. This was at 70`s. I saw an interview of Peter Freestone that says that there will be things like that in the movie. By the way I think the film is awesome and I shed a tear by the end. It`s so emotional.
cool cat777777777	I got this ad on the new ralphthemoviemaker video, and it's the only ad that I haven't skipped in a while.
LyleGlenn	Freddy had much more humour and wits than is shown in this trailer, I believe. Let's hope the film does him justice in this aspect.
get the fvck out	OOF

Just Noah Brooks	Did Freddie have the mustache during the time of 1977 recording We Will Rock You? I think not! But anyway movie deserves an Oscar so excited to see it looks incredible!!!
legofan101	I've paid my dues Time after time I've done my sentence But committed no crime And bad mistakes  I've made a few I've had my share of sand kicked in my face But I've come through  We are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end We are the champions We are the champions No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions of the world  I've taken my bows And my curtain calls You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it I thank you all  But it's been no bed of roses No pleasure cruise I consider it a challenge before the whole human race And I ain't gonna lose  We are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end We are the champions We are the champions No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions of the world  We are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end We are the champions We are the champions No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions

April Simnel	Oh, wow! Fingers crossed!  So, err... who's playing Bowie? I mean, they won't skip the making of Under Pressure, will they?
Dan Holliday	wow

Harsh Pherwani	Elliot finally came out of introversion, love it
Dan The Man	It still amazes me that tall this happened in my lifetime. Im old. But I do remember the electricity, it was real and brought by the fans, not by the production. Music was the beginning and the end of the sound. Great times, Rest Fred, you brought the fire kid.

Jack DiCarlo	Everything about this movie looks perfect, I’m a huge queen super fan, and to see them portrayed in such an accurate way is great. The color grading and cinematography is something else! I cannot put to words just how excited I am to see this project in roughly 4 months

Pluekward Emz	I’m so excited for this. Queen was such an amazing band and Freddie Mercury was such an amazing singer. I can’t wait to see it!
Larryismyhome	YESSSSSSSSSS
Ron Farkas	LAUGHING at the folks thinking this is going to the Oscars. You know who directed half this film and is getting the full credit? Bryan Singer! Who? A known pedophile. Prepare for the biggest #MeToo of all time, his downfall is what this film will accomplish.
JojoChampion	The tache and short hair wasn't around in 1977 / We Will Rock You era, so point deducted.  Otherwise, I'm there!
Calvinos	I'm proud to be born on September 5th!

Samatha Barba	How is this not on trending
音液ゥGUXX	My God I'm so prepared for this.
ThatllShowEm	Anyone else hearing the fading WWRY music from 2:15 to the end as a heartbeat?
Some Random Guy	Still hoping for Under Pressure to be in the film with David Bowie, god that would make the movie for me. The film looks amazing though even without Under Pressure.
P t	why make a movie about a liberal poser like freddie mercury? better time could of been spent making a movie about a singer with actual talent like ted nugent
Dexter Morgan	rami malek is gonna kill it
Salina Ramirez	The guy looks like saboo + vince noir.  Hehe.
Cameron Thompkins	I'm a huge Queen fan and I hope this movie tells an accurate story about Queen. Not tryna waste my money on a movie that's gonna sneak in a few untrue details or leave out any truths to the story.
Deodar95	I want to like it so bad but I still feel like Sacha Baron Cohen was robbed of the role he was born to play
Aashish Khakha	Sacha Cohen should have been here. Such a wasted opportunity.
Josh Orlowski	That scene at the end has to be the famous Live Aid performance, thought by many to be the greatest performance ever. From his white washed jeans to his wife beater shirt and bracelet, it looks like a perfect match. Cant wait to see it!
Rodrigo Colina.	OMG! <3 #Venezuela
JUANJEN75	I do not know if I'm preparing to see Freddie cry
Christine Bode	Can't wait to see this!
jkws	The GENIUS MINDS of MERCURY & MOZART.  Perhaps there will be another 200 years from now....perhaps not.
DisiveSoftworks	🎵 COME TO ME BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY !!! 🎶  And, seeing the quick times of interpretecion from Rami Malek. I had see the brilliant grimace of the moviments, type-talk, so hyped, so emocional.   I'm see a Oscar to this film.
redxsage	This will be ... *_WONDERFUL._*
Ottoniel Torres Rodriguez	The Greatest Band in history. The Beatles were just the Backstreet Boys of their time. The Who.... are very good, and Zeppelin are great. but never the greatest. Never Queen.
StanFredo	"We Are The Champions"is the best part! ;)
Rafael Saffiotti	YES!!!!!
Travis Richey	This looks amazing.  And interesting to see how deliberately they included references to his homosexuality after backlash about the rumor they were straightwashing his story.  I can't wait for this! ~Trav
Richard Pearson	Looks Fabulous
Aaron Lyons	Can not wait to see this I've been a massive fan of queen growing up one of my all time favourite bands I absolutely love them this film is gonna be amazing and rami malek looks incredible!!!!

Markyajv	Looks GREAT! I think they cast the right actor.....he is very good.  I am hoping for Fat Bottomed Girls.
Demanasik	очень надеюсь что будет хороший фильм и не ударятся лицом в грязь...  Тема уж очень эпичная.
Spickle Nick	LET'S GO. I'M OFFICIALLY HYPED! Although i was already hyped with the first announcement.
Travis Marshall	Weird. Some shots he looks near identical to Mercury and most others not even close. Example being moments with long hair and sunglasses. I'm like, "Okay. They nailed this casting". Then when he's standing in the rain he looks less like the lead singer of Queen and more like a Detroit cop who JUST read the ransom note and is now wondering what depths he has to sink to, to get back his wife and daughter from a criminal underground human trafficking syndicate. I still am of the belief that Sacha Baron Cohen would have been the superior choice, but be that as it may, as I always say, 70's Queen rocked WAY better than '80's Queen.
Jake Krynock	1:19 Hell ya!
Desirée Ramirez	You’re a legend, Freddie...
Tanmay K	Who wants to live forever? 🎶
Romy Galdamez	Hell yes

Kirk Redgate	Mike Myers has a good disguise.
Nadia Juarez	Whoever has been doing the song mashups for the Bohemian Rhapsody trailers is a god.
parkway811	I am in a quandary here.  During their reign on the charts, I was never a fan of their style of music which I'm thinking "hard rock" or "theatrical rock".  I can ditto Elton John & David Bowie. Freddie Mercury's orientation was unknown (to me) at the time.  Ditto Elton & David.  The type of music I listened to was R&B going back to the early 1960's to this time period.  Disco, which I loved, came later. The concept of LGBTQ music didn't exist.  I never gave thought to that genre until the present.  Steve Grand, Years & Years, Brendan Stansell, Ria Mae are just some of the current musicians I've been buying CD's of. At age 70, I don't attend films especially that I use a walker plus going alone is no fun.  Should I want to see a movie, I wait until the DVD comes out - "Love, Simon" for instance.  The story line may be the impetus for me to purchase the DVD on release rather than the music. Big question:  Would one consider Queen to be part of the LGBTQ genre like those I've mentioned?

Blizzard Evil	wow cant wait it
zyxwut321	Thing is, if this wasn't historically true you couldn't make up a movie with a character like Freddie Mercury and have it be in any way believable. He was simply one of a kind, one in a billion, one of the 5 greatest entertainers of who's ever lived with MJ, Elvis, the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe.
Gabriel Ayala	La tengo durísima

HSin Sin	Wow! True Legend. Looking forward to watch it in a theatre.  You should also interview his family and make it part of extended version of the movie like this old Telegraph article of his mother: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9523701/Exclusive-interview-Freddie-Mercurys-mother-on-her-dear-boy.html

RabuHina	I'm so glad that Queen is Getting a movie based on how they started and how they managed to work hard and build themselves up to legendary status. The entire cast better got awards for their outstanding performances. I also hope that the movie shows how some of Queen's underrated (but just as awesome as their iconic ones) songs such as millionaire waltz,  seaside rendezvous,  ogre battle etc
Shinku Kirito Ichika	I'm definitely gonna see this for sure! I thank my mom for being a Queen fan and introducing this band to me. Sure I'm more into heavy metal, but Queen are an outstanding classic band and among the greatest ever. And Freddie himself would be proud of this.
Abbey Rhapsody	"You are a legend, Fred" "We're all legends"
Kateri Scott	Yep, bringing a box of tissues with me to this one.
NewfieParamedic	Rami Malek deserves an Oscar nomination just for the trailer alone!
Jyoti pakuwal	THIS IS BEYOUND EVERYTHING♥
Nano Jurassic	That opening is just beautiful

Tamojit Ghosh	'Mark my words, No one will play Queen'. That aged well.

Justin Schiavo	GET THIS TO 1 ON TRENDING
THEMADCHESYHD	This is Oscar Worthy right here!!!
BeyonderBill	I just hope the film showcases some more obscure/deep songs out of their catalog. Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, and so on are great songs, but I'd love for the film to introduce some of the less heard songs to people who have no clue. Anything from their first couple of albums. (Liar, March Of The Black Queen, Son And Daughter... so many great songs that most people have never heard.)
Vardoc 1	what a moment to be alive
Renato Costa	Still excited to see this movie, May Freddie Mercury Rest In Peace, and I'm hoping the movie lives up to the hype along with one of the most successful rock bands of all time.

tesha white	I'm already crying. I'm so ready for this movie.
Ansibarius	Interesting shifting around of songs. "Fat bottomed girls" is from 1978 not 1974, "We will rock you" is from 1977 not 1980 (i.e., way before the mustache period).
MichaelNicle	Rami looks and sounds SO Close to Freddie!!! and beyond that, the film looks incredible. A Glimpse behind the scenes of one of the greatest and most important bands of all time. This will be a very special movie, i can feel it. Cannot wait for October!!!

Akash Dutt	Legend 🙏
Nevena Jevtic	i just cant believe that this is happening,queen has their own movie,like,this is going to be a masterpiece ive wanted this my whole life i just love queen,their music changed my life a lot,they really deserve this and im so freaking happy that this happened! freddie must be proud from the sky right now ! i love this !
Harsh Khanna	I got high just watching the trailer
Terry I	37 people are hysterical queens
Madison Rose	Holy shi-
Anthony T	Absolutely cannot wait for this!!
Daniel Langer	Why were they clapping to We Will Rock You when Freddie was singing We Are The Champions?
Grant Schinto	Don't be fooled by the apparent historically inaccurate part about when "We Are The Champions" came out . .  Ah, the power of editing.  (At least I'm HOPING that's what it is, LOL.)
Brendon's puppet	THIS LOOKS ICONIC!!
Jono Newman	The 2019 Oscar nomination list is saturated already-this film should break records

KayPlayzRoblox_YT _YT	Comment your thoughts to my Instagram post @freddies_sweet_lady
Ella Rose	God, the CHILLS !!!!!
Avantdread	looks amazing
BZmusicOfficial	I'm really excited about it but I have two comments. Maybe it's just because the trailer's short cuts. So, here it seems that Freddie is just meeting Roger and Brian after a Smile show when Tim Staffel leaves the band. Bud in reality he was already around, and maybe even lived in the same flat as Roger. The other thing is the We Will Rock You tapping part when Brian tells Freddie about his plans with the song. But originally it's a '77 song when Freddie didn't have a moustache and had longer hair - unlike in the trailer. But anyways... I just can't wait to see the movie!
Stephen Z. Ridley	Wow. Newton Thomas Sigel killed it. This cinematography looks so freakin good.
ADOKA AWP	L O V E
Lawrence Palacios	I really hope that it's not just their famous songs because Queen has made many great songs, it'll be disappointing to see just those songs in particular (well-known ones).
Oscar Flores	😍😍omg
Mhaikel Alipio	I am not excited until this new trailer! Please take my money!
LostMercenary99	TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Julieth	I cant wait for thissssss
TheMusicalGenius	I know for a fact that Rami/Freddie viewed this video.
Louis Colon	That was a killer queen trailer 😉
Anarki	this looks so great
Ozzy Laguna	mind blown when he said, "what if I don't have time" that wasn't acting that was Freddie
The Joshy	The face of the actor not convence me
Natalie Riste	I have no words I can’t wait
Gabrielle Neff	Rami malek is not a good actor.
Harsh Saxena	FUXK RELEASE IT FUXKING NOW!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭

Jair Silvera	SOOOOO GOOOOOODDDD!
César Aguilar	At minute 2:16 anybody else notice that the rhythm of the public is wrong? they are clapping twice instead of one.
mrblf652	Watching this gave me goosebumps.
Connor Murphy	Alright, dammit, this movie is gonna be GORGEOUS and if I don't go see this on opening night I wouldn't be able to live with myself. OK maybe I could but I'm gonna go see it anyway. Can't wait.
Zachary O'Connell	YES!
Soumyo Mukherjee	To borrow a line from a different band. . . . YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!                 - The Who
Daniel Guerra	What a great movie! I can't wait to watch it, I'm so excited. But one thing that gets me confused is why does Freddie has short hair and mustache in the scene where May talks to him about We Will Rock You. At the time when News of the World was released, Freddie didn't have mustache yet. He had long hair and no mustache as we can see on the official video of the song. Despite that, I think this movie will be amazing. Greets from Honduras!
Esat Günay	why isn't this on #1 trending yet?
Jay Rathore	Mr. Robot: "Tell me you are seeing this too..."

Azucena Cruz	Caaaan anyybodyyy find meee somebody toooo loooooooove?
彡3hree	I know Queen it's all because 'Suicide Squad' theme song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by panic! at the disco
Muhammad Christ	Im so ready
Zachary S. Marsh	So the film ends with Live Aid, which happened in 1985, but Freddie's AIDS diagnosis, which didn't happen until 1987, is what helps him lead the band to that performance?
Warrios Comics	oooooohhhhhbhhhggggg
Jimena Carretero	This will be the best movie of 2018 and the best rock documentary of all times.
RollTide1987	And the Oscar goes to.......Rami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody!

Benjamin Long	Man, as a lifelong fan of Raimi Malek, this has me really excited. I love Queen and their music, and I think the story of Freddie Mercury needs to be told. Really excited for this. This trailer is much better than the first trailer we got.
Krisztián Környei	I had goosebumps while watching this trailer. Greatest rock band ever existed!
rJUSTINr1995	Looks like it'll be an okay movie. Nothing special
Somendra Vyas	Time for led Zeppelin too
Noodleboy N	And the Oscar for best special effect goes to Freddy’s teeth

Elizabeth Schuyler-Hamilton	it's been a long journey...
Cai Cai	I don't want to say my father loves thier music very much even though I wasn't born on Queen era's but my Father still listen to their music and I already love their music thier legacy remains until the end. I will definitely rock this movie!
John D	greatest frontman in the biz ever no contest

WestNileSnipes	I think this might be a pretty decent movie after all.
The_masked toaster	November 7th.... I think that Fox thinks this has Oscar potential . Nov and Dec are when studio starts to put out movies they believe will get Oscar potential/ Would not be surprised to see a best Oscar push
Christina Cortez	Ready Freddie?
Sean Fries	HACKERMAN!!!!!!   or   josh
James Jones	I really hope that this film is good. My fear, however, is that it'll be just a mediocre exploitation of their music. Fingers crossed.
Evgen Khersonets	In the end of the movie there have to be "show must go on"
Abdullah Hadi Hadi	Now this,we really need this
Pink Lamborghini	Michael Jackson cameo please
Jack Yamat	I can't wait! Rami got Freddie down!
Power of Pop	oh wow.

Kayleigh Natasha	'Roger, there's only room in this band for one hysterical Queen' Love it
goldwincs	I'm still hesitant about this, because the only thing come to mind when I see the trailer is what it could have been with Sacha Baron Cohen.  Hope the film will be great.
Gargeyi	Gwylim Lee looks more Brian May than  Brian May himself xD
Joseph Dutra	Whoever did the sound mixing deserves a medal!!

Nameless Tory	Is David Bowie gonna be in this movie?
YouVSMeTV	Looking good.
Subash Pariyar	Straight out of Compton but rock
James Cawood	honest though, Freddie Mercury sounds like Tommy Wiseau
Manuel David Rendon Acevedo	I'm completely off the rooftop excited for the movie, into my radar right now!, what I love the most is that they don't show the song of the same name but they keep it as a surprise around with their other songs blending them amazingly in both the first and second trailer, whatever issues they had going on during filming I don't care, what's more important is the entire movie as a whole, and I think it will be a huge experience
crazedmartinez	It looks like they aren’t really gonna show that much of his relationships with men ....
Han Solo62	WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD
Rushi Tilva	John Deacon looks the same 👍👍

Hunger games Of thrones	I smell an Oscar for my boy Rami
Charlie Orrell	They've already fucked the timeline. In the bit where brian suggests we will rock you, freddie has his moustache which was grown in 1980 however we will rock you was on News Of The World three years prior in 1977. I hope there isn't a big continuity problem in this movie or it'll spoil it for me.
manish pandey	damn😍😍😍

David Cantos	When I heard this song in the beginning again, I was thinking about suicide squad.
Sadie Darkbloom	I do bout you guys but seeing Tiffany Oscar and I think Lilly (correct me if I’m wrong ) my heart sank😭🙌🏻🐈
lonny breaux	The behavior yall exhibited is just so iconic like.....The legend jumped out
Michael Wright	Are they making it so "We Will Rock You" is written in like...1982? Or did they make Freddie grow his moustache in freaking 1976/1977?! Because in the bit where Brian is talking about recording a song the audience can perform - you have 1977 John, Brian and Roger and an extremely out of place 1980s Freddie Mercury.  Sorry, but Freddie had other looks other than moustache-Freddie. And to change his look for the '70s is inexcusable and unnecessary.
