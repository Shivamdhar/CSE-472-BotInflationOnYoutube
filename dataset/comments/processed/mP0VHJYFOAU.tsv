Alice Bejleri	What legend wa Freddie In the beginning Sacha Cohen wa nominated but there wa no interest in them and they broke the conversation then Ben Whishaw who is a very good actress in fact The troika trio tried to say that Singer s first ruler wa a pedophile caught by every aspect ha been dropped here As far a Brian is concerned I have a lot to say about him He is expecting from a Brian who show sensational thing from Freddie s life a his sick leg and Freddie s suffering before dying and such like this before releasing a book of his own or being both ridiculed by John Deacon and put out a hard article about him in the English tabloid Or for Brian in the 90 he said we can not continue without Freddie and now say that Adam had range higher than Freddie and Freddie would be jealous of her while not forgetting to mechanically wail a Freddie video at any concert they do with Adam s goblet Freddie s birthday and Freddie s birthday did not share her but the movie Freddie s Freddie to the bone on his expence do now have a significant timing and is disgusting a an idea Brian is the first Roger his doll both without character good musician but people who have lost their character or themselves for fam and money Who know Freddie well just get tired of all this and he is laughing from above while saying Oh f ck them all darling

Stanislav Fomin	Благодаря таким фильмам в очередной раз убеждаешься что гении своего времени — все немного того… не от мира сего И если их не запинали соседские дети не бойкотировали одноклассники и не довело до полного морального уничтожение злое и беспощадное общество то из таких людей с вероятностью в 99 9 выйдет гениальная творческая личность Вот как Меркьюри например Манерный пакистанец гей И кто бы подумал что такой — станет иконой для нескольких поколений

L A	Is it me or are there scene that were not in the film Ps p I did not know much queen and I went to see the movie a bit random a few day ago and I loved it The actor is awesome and deserves an Oscar for his performance the film is really well done from beginning to end A huge Bravo
fanis firstpriest	I saw the movie yesterday While watching I started feeling somehow surprised but in a negative way At the end I wa just disappointed I wa waiting for that movie a long time a I am a Queen and Freddy fan a well The movie go really fast and it give a sense of a non refined plot Real fact all the fan around the world know go upside down or even just omitted from the movie Some example The way Freddie met Mary Austin seems like they had already know each other And if I am not wrong Freddy wa introduced to Mary or vice versa by Brian something that is not shown in the movie Another wtf thing is that the director show a very early success of the group before A Night at the Opera year of 1975 which wa the actual turning point forward to their success by giving scene of gig with huge crowd even already being familiar with some of the band then hit A small detail the song Fat Bottomed Girls is listened in the movie in the year of 1976 I think even if this wa a Jazz album song issued in 1979 Then the director suddenly jump from 1976 to the moustache era of Freddy in 1980 No reference to the collaboration with David Bowie at all in making Under Pressure in 1981 No reference to the almost but never complete collaboration with Michael Jackson the same period The top of the iceberg the movie wa indeed such a cold shower is that towards the end of the movie little before the Live Aid performance there s a scene where Freddy call the group back a they were dismissed after a rehearsal and tell them that he had AIDS Absolute falsification of the truth All the people being aware of Freddy s basic bio fact know that he didn t know of his HIV infection not earlier than the last 3 4 month of 1986 The fact that he may wa concerned way longer about that doesn t change that fact and of course the fact that he didn t tell to anybody about his health issue before he wa officially diagnosed And a few day before Live Aid is way too far from that day As an overall sense despite the fact that the movie ha some well shooted scene especially the Live Aid reproduction and Rami Malek play his role pretty well not perfect though in my opinion at the end it s like the movie wa targetting to a beginner of the whole Queen and F M story
hay man	What season of Mr robot is this
A Retarded Orange Ape In The White House	Rami Malek better be nominated for best male actor Movie wa amazing go see it

ifiwasyermother	I just saw it You know what From a strictically technical point of view Rami did a great job I ll spare you the detail so I don t spoil it for you But I will tell you this remember the movie My week with Marilyn Michelle Williams did a great job too Just like in Rami s case the make up the mannerism the inflection etc everything wa there Well almost everything There are certain people that had such presence and charisma that you just can t mimic that yo a T You just can t You either have it or you don t You can do everything right like Michelle and Rami but I didnt see Marilyn then and I don t see Freddie now I see an extremely awesome performance maybe even worthy of an Oscar but you can never forget you re watching Michelle and Rami in those movie You re watching actor play these legend This is not necessarily bad but just giving you head up

Timid Kitten	I LOVE QUEEN but this film is DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING It just didn t capture the magic of Queen or the spirit of the 1970 s Rami s portrayal of Freddie is more like a caricature of him ultra exaggerated overbite and all the other band member have no depth or nuance in character Besides the producer only used commercial hit such a We Will Rock You We Are the Champions etc which are certainly good but what about their earlier output and lesser known gem such a Seven Seas of Rhye March of the Black Queen The Fairy Feller s Master Stroke Nevermore Lily of the Valley Ogre Battle etc

Jesus is Lord	What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul in the end Jesus If Freddie Mercury didn t repent he perished in his sin of homosexuality now he is reaping the sorrow and misery of sin by going to an eternal hell Following the world of fame and fortune is appealing but it will reap the bitter end of destruction God is not mocked

D.A. Visual	Just watched the World Premiere yesterday in cinema in Macedonia I ve been waiting for it some time now anxious Meanwhile watched almost every documentary i could find about Queen Being 28y old i heard of Queen and listened their song probably since 15y ago but i have never ever been so attached to their song a in this past year Playing them on repeat and whole playlist Now seeing all of that the documentary and the story of Freddie and so on due to how amazing this film is i wa in same time disappointed that in the film the timeline of the event are not really portrayed correctly Freddie coghs blood a early a 1983 and tell his band he ha the aid before the Live Aid concert in 1985 which is not correct He get news about it in late 1986 or 1987 and tell his band in 1989 when they get back in Montreaux for the Innuendo album In that regard i expect bit more drama and more fitting timeline This way although still somehow oddly fitting and nice it wasnt just correct and accordingly dramatic Anyway i advise who havent to go and watch it because it great tribute for a great band If not greatest darling

Rick Cummings	It wa awesomeness on a stick
Andrea Waters	I just finished watching Bohemian Rhapsody and all I can say is BRILLIANT Like a ripple on the water the story spread out and add just the right amount of their life thing they faced and finally overcame While each member of the band wa brilliant in their own right Queen wa the true epitome of a family The maker of this movie however understood that Queen wa all about their music and using that a the center of this movie the end result became a true master piece In the end they became a true powerhouse that no one can touch and no one will ever be able to duplicate And a for Freddie You take a perfectionist add a wee bit of eccentric a heart and soul a large a the universe mix well with the other member of the band and I think he is smiling and at peace knowing that his music and his work wa understood And in the end that is enough
TheEndOfThought	Just got back from Sneak preview tonight November 1st and it wa the best movie I have seen in year IT wa like being in a documentary and rock concert all at the same time Them cutting Fat Bottom Girls in the obvious spot that is what meant to be put in is a test of our time of censorship for the whiny progressive who ruin everything because they feel guilty about being given everything in the world and they dont know what to do with it Check it out if you like good music and a great story of a real rock legend

Omar Borg	I saw this movie and it s an epic film but if your re a real fan of QUEEN you see that there is so many mistake in it There is almost 8 thing that didn t really happened in real life example when they are making we will rock you Freddie is with moustache and short hair and in real life he wa with long hair and no moustache at that time 2 when i read a biography i read that he knew he had aid between 1986 and 1987 and in the movie he knew just week before live aid 1985 3 The band didn t split they had the tour of the album THE WORKS so the last show wa just 8 week before live aid they all wanted a break 4 His lover Jim Hutton wa not a bartender he wa a hairdresser and they met at a night club 5 John Deacon wasn t the first bassist he wa i think the fourth one there ar 3 other mistake so how did thing like this appear in a movie of this quality

tribal spaceman	BAD MOVIE this movie doe not do justice to queen legacy it is so badly made it like watching a tv movie that is souless freddie and queen deserved a lot better than this garbage and it doe not uphold the magnificence of queen it like going through thier wikipedia page what a horrible movie to be made on one of the greatest rock band of all time the producer should be held accountable for ruining queen image and not giving the public the true legacy of queen retarded acting and a very bad movie avoid if you prefer to remember queen the way the were

Salb814	They say they can t tell the difference between Freddie mercury and ramus malek but I think that s bogus He doe not really look like him at all He s just dressed like him Sacha baron Cohen would have been a better choice since he look more similar and had a better idea of how to make a movie about both the band and Freddies personal life compared to this disappointing film

pilates68	pilates68 This movie look great Remi Malek is uncanny The trailer doe suggest however that the movie will advance the idea that Queen were so out there that they faced an uphill struggle to have their music heard But the truth is that many band in that era were doing progressive experimtal music that wa long and not exactly catchy for radio play They all faced the same uphill struggle with music executive wanting pop song I m talking about YES Genesis ELP King Crimson Pink Floyd etc They all drove the music industry crazy with their concept and arrangement Wasn t just Queen Wonder if this movie will touch on that 1 day ago

Mohamed Shaker	I ’ m really really excited with Bohemian Rhapsody movie the trailer are fantastic But one fact that pissed me off is in the second trailer we see Brian May talking with Freddie Mercury He said I want to give the audience a song that they can perform and the iconic foot stomping and clap of We will Rock you wa played while Brian wa shown clapping and then they all began to clap And Freddie said What ’ s the lyric and the WE WILL WE WILL ROCK U came in Nothing seemed wrong yet until I saw Freddie ’ s look which wa short hair and mustache We will rock you wa released in 1977 in the album NEWS of the World Freddie ’ s Short Hair wa in 1980 So we ’ re seeing 1980 ’ s Freddie talking about making a song in 1977 I think they should change this mistake in time Some people say they ’ re talking about Radio Gaga But we ’ re seeing the foot stomp and clap and they ’ re playing We will rock you So it can ’ t be Radio Gaga

Anton Prest	This is absolutely anticipated Just want to make an observation though This guy who is impersonating Freddie doesn t seem to do him justice physically or charisma wise Mercury wa a bigger than life persona thus charismatic and wa much taller than this dude Don t hate my comment Just an observation And yes I understand that it s absolutely impossible to portray someone 100 convincingly but I think they should had tried harder
Alli Cera	If Ben Stiller wa younger I think he could also be great for this role
Anupam Shekhar	Farrokh Bulsara Freddie Mercury wa born and grew up in Zanzibar Tanzania At 10 he wa sent to a boarding school in Bombay and moved to England at 17 He never acknowledged either his African or Indian nationality or his known associate from both the nation I don t think they ll ever portray this in the movie despite calling it his story

rieyuki	Lots of Sacha Baron Cohen fan still arguing he would have been a better Freddie It s pointless to argue and try to change their mind respect their opinion and move on Whether Cohen would have delivered a better acting performance than Malek in playing a believable Freddie we may never know but read these comment from the band member google the quote below to find the article I m not making this up May in an interview with Classic Rock magazine also talked about why Cohen and the project parted company We the band felt that his presence in the movie would be very distracting referencing the star s outstanding performance in The Dictator Les Miserables and Hugo a being very much Sacha Baron Cohen performance Said May And we thought there ha to be no distraction in the Freddie movie You have to really suspend that disbelief The man who play Freddie you have to really believe is Freddie And we didn t feel that could really happen with Sacha Casting opinion from the band member themselves carry more weight than anybody else yes They ve seen Cohen audition a Freddie we haven t They personally knew Freddie we didn t They know what work for them a Queen They are more qualified than anybody here to determine whether actor A B or C would be compelling a Freddie Let s just enjoy the movie in it entirety and argue le about who is playing Freddie If the movie is a amazing a these two trailer were this movie will be huge It will be a movie that doe justice to Queen It will be a movie that doe justice to Freddie Mercury Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon all of them at the same time This is the story of a graphic designer who designed the Queen crest with an uncanny ability to engage an entire concert audience an aspiring astrophysicist who later returned and completed the PhD in 2007 an aspiring dentist who wa asked back in 1970 by Peter Gabriel to join Genesis but declined paving the way for Phil Collins career in Genesis and an electrical engineer who created the iconic Deacy Amp for Brian May s guitar sound The story of Queen is amazing yet tragic yet inspring in the end and I can t wait to see the movie

Josean Paolo Ombria	I am cry on the trailer what more if watch the whole movie can t wait for this
Bec	Whilst I m really looking forward to the film I feel a if this trailer suggests the film focus more on Brian May and Roger Taylor whilst neglecting John Deacon I mean John only appears at the briefest moment and we literally never hear him speak either in the teaser trailer or this one Whereas Brian is shown in this really positive and dramatic light showing how he had the idea for We Will Rock You Roger is shown a a drama queen but in a really funny way and both he and Brian s positive relationship with Freddie is made obvious It s sad because John wa said to have had a close friendship with Freddie also to the point where he did not carry on with Queen after Freddie died because he felt Queen wa not the same without him I just hope that despite Brian and Roger s supposed fractured relationship with John and with the pair of them being so involved in the making of this movie that they can still include John s contribution to the band Don t get me wrong I love all the band member I just hope it work s fair to all of them ☺

Dylan Wheeler	REVERSE MANDELA EFFECT everyone remembers “ We Are The Champions ” ending with “ of the wooorld ” yet in the official song he actually only say it after the first chorus but not at the end Interesting because at the end of this trailer it sound like the end of the song and they strongly emphasize “ of the world ” That being said I can ’ t wait to see the movie and I really hope the full song is in it so we can know for sure Also Rami Malek is a wonderful actor so I have no doubt that he will absolutely give the legendary role it ’ s due respect Side side note call it “ coincidence ” but for anyone who ha watched Mr Robot season 3 they show occasional short scene of a “ large hadron collider ” which is what is said to be causing the Mandela Effects Just sayin🤔

Axel Rouse	👑QUEEN👑
Druutilite	This is a wonderful idea but I hope to god this isn t another Mamma Mia in execution Don t get me wrong I love this band but it might not work if all the song are hamfisted in and abrupt Also if this is a musical there s a major problem Singing out of plot Like a lot of the song in Mamma Mia can work out with musical and it make sense They all suddenly sing everyone can magically dance I won t comment on the logistics of it all But there are problem when you mix this with a band Is the band singing IN the movie half the time or are they singing out of plot Are we hearing a real performance that they re supposedly putting on or are we hearing a classic out of plot song and the setting of said song is in a concert hall This sound dumb yes why would they be performing an out of plot song if they re a band in a movie Well there are many way this can happen Think back to The Greatest Showman Never Enough It wa a generic pop song in a time when two people couldn t date if they were different race I hope this movie doesn t do anything similar to that but that s just one example of a mix up That song Never Enough wa being performed but the question is wa it actually pop in the plot Was the song she wa singing just turned into pop for u to enjoy it If it were pop in that time frame it would not have worked at all It wa a very strange mix up What if there s a moment in this movie where they re not at a performance but just at an event or something and they start playing a song Everyone dance etc etc Are we meant to believe that s a part of the plot or it s just another song shoved in It might just get confusing Either way I ll still watch this movie just wanted to bring that up

Miguel de la vega	Sacha Baron Cohen said he tried to make a film based on Freddie and all the crazy thing he went through behind the scene but he couldn t because Queen s surviving band mate wanted the film to focus on them instead and how they continued on after Freddie died that s like making a movie about the Jackson 5 and how Tito Jermaine and the rest of the brother continued on with their career after Michael died no one want to see that this trailer seems like Freddie s the focus of the movie after all but trailer can be very misleading

Mozart Valdez	Hey planet Earth 👽👾 I need your help If you like feel good edm music then you might wan na read this When life get rough there s always that one thing we a human can go back to and feel like everything is alright In my opinion that thing is good music There have been so many day before when I wa younger where everything seemed so overwhelmingly negative Like there wa no light at the end of my tunnel But then I started listening to my idol marshmello and zedd included and somehow it made me feel some sort of way Almost like a hope entered into my life At that moment I knew what my dream in life wa I wanted to make music like my favorite artist I knew I d never be able to even afford a keyboard so it stayed a dream buried deep inside me never to see the light of day Until now that is Here I am few year later and I m making the music I d always look for but never could find This journey in my life ha been amazing And I want to help people feel the same way by listening to the music I create I wan na be able to make memory for other people I want people to hear my music and let it change your day for the better That s why I started making music 🌌They re not your typical dance track My song are flooded with emotion and vibe They re very spacey and futuristic They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy I m not trying to boast I m just trying to help you all feel good vibe And in 2018 I think alot more people need that If you could help me out by checking my song it would mean so much I promise you won t regret it Thank you for being one of my first fan if you choose to listen 🙏 I ll forever remember the first people who supported me 3

parkway811	I am in a quandary here During their reign on the chart I wa never a fan of their style of music which I m thinking hard rock or theatrical rock I can ditto Elton John David Bowie Freddie Mercury s orientation wa unknown to me at the time Ditto Elton David The type of music I listened to wa R B going back to the early 1960 s to this time period Disco which I loved came later The concept of LGBTQ music didn t exist I never gave thought to that genre until the present Steve Grand Years Years Brendan Stansell Ria Mae are just some of the current musician I ve been buying CD s of At age 70 I don t attend film especially that I use a walker plus going alone is no fun Should I want to see a movie I wait until the DVD come out Love Simon for instance The story line may be the impetus for me to purchase the DVD on release rather than the music Big question Would one consider Queen to be part of the LGBTQ genre like those I ve mentioned

BZmusicOfficial	I m really excited about it but I have two comment Maybe it s just because the trailer s short cut So here it seems that Freddie is just meeting Roger and Brian after a Smile show when Tim Staffel leaf the band Bud in reality he wa already around and maybe even lived in the same flat a Roger The other thing is the We Will Rock You tapping part when Brian tell Freddie about his plan with the song But originally it s a 77 song when Freddie didn t have a moustache and had longer hair unlike in the trailer But anyways I just can t wait to see the movie

Michael Wright	Are they making it so We Will Rock You is written in like 1982 Or did they make Freddie grow his moustache in freaking 1976 1977 Because in the bit where Brian is talking about recording a song the audience can perform you have 1977 John Brian and Roger and an extremely out of place 1980s Freddie Mercury Sorry but Freddie had other look other than moustache Freddie And to change his look for the 70 is inexcusable and unnecessary
