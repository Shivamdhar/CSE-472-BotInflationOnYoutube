katman77018	i think Ted s father wa CIA and wa part of the operation to kill JFK That picture of him on the street handing out literature with Oswald say a lot about it I wonder who took that picture and why How did it get preserved It make sense because after JFK wa murdered by Mossad and CIA black operation people etc Rafael Cruz took off to Canada to live and cool off That is where Ted wa born Then the time came when Rafael s son had grown up and received a great education at Princeton if I am not mistaken he wa ready for politics and Rafael put in a call to GHW Bush and called in a marker and requested help in getting his son in the political gravy train How did a poor Cuban guy get a education at a prestigious northeastern University Somebody helped him For his high school training he went to Second Baptist school in Houston to make it look good for the idiotic Christians And later on after working in the Bush administration our boy Ted came to Texas and somehow got elected to the Senate here Isn t that nice Ted wa the man who pushed to have Roberts installed at the supreme court you know the guy who single handedly gave u obama care Birds of a feather since both men are closet gay men who are married to make it look good but I digress PS Go ahead and vote and worry about all of these creature It matter not Left right democrat republican all the same working for the same bos As Stalin said one time Go ahead and vote Because you always vote for u

vwsaiphone	Tell me how the majority of black people don ‚Äô t really want to leave the ghetto and get them self better education and work hard My father came over from Italy with nothing wa in the New York Italian ghetto he didn ‚Äô t take the government hand out to pay for the crap hole he wa living in he got two job in the second grade and put himself into a private school then paid his way to get to a good college and now owns his own engineering company Ok now let ‚Äô s look at 70 of the just one race in this example black ghetto they want the Obama phone and want free healthcare and want 15 buck an hour to do a piss poor job at McDonald ‚Äô s getting my order wrong Why would anyone deserve 15 buck to not do a great job Free healthcare isn ‚Äô t free and that phone isn ‚Äô t free Those government subsidized home aren ‚Äô t free Are paid by the hard working black white and any other race from the middle class and upper class It take hard work are their real racist as hat yes But what what people don ‚Äô t want to admit is for every one racist white person their are 3 racist black one Let ‚Äô s say white people started a white people matter movement Not the KKK but just like the black life matter movement The outrage would be ten time more Bc it wa the white And now let ‚Äô s address the black on black crime that is the number one highest crime rate in this great country And why won ‚Äô t anyone talk about that more why Bc a black guy killing anther black can ‚Äô t be labeled a racist Let me ask you this ok If a white guy kill a black guy not a cop just a white guy and a black guy What will the black community call it racist act But in reality it wa a hold up Bc the black guy had a huge gold chain and nice watch on And the poor white dude just wanted to take them But if the black guy kill anther black guy it ‚Äô s passed over and in the community of black it ‚Äô s called gangster killing gangster How is that ok It ‚Äô s not It ‚Äô s not ok This whole idea that white have more privilege make no sense if a white guy doesn ‚Äô t work he get put on the same street a the black guy no different If you come from a crap community white blackman green whatever it will take mote work to move up If you have le education it will take more work what I honestly see in the ghetto is laziness and being ok with living in shit Before anyone responds please just use your Brains and don ‚Äô t be defensive be open and talk Attacking a white Person Bc they are white or disliking a white person Bc they are successful or thinking they owe you something bc 100 year ago slavery wa around doesn ‚Äô t mean any white person today ha owned anyone so don ‚Äô t hold that over anyone ‚Äô s head in this modern day I am not saying forget I am saying don ‚Äô t hold it If someone isn ‚Äô t being racist then brining it up doesn ‚Äô t even need to happen we live in a much better day and age for anyone Of any color or sex It ‚Äô s great

TheLamp03	Wake up the European or Caucasian Americans Christianity ha rocked u to sleep First of all these European Christians killed million of aboriginal people and colonized their land After stealing the land these same Christians enslaved a nation of negro people for 400 year and supervised their captivity They introduced the slave to their European Messiah and their Christian doctrine Secondly they enforced illiteracy upon the negro man to prevent self identity and the true knowledge of their God Most High I often wonder if there is a correlation between the true Messiah being hung in a tree and the hanging of negro They wrote in their constitution that the negro are 3 5 of a man What true man of God Most High would portray a human this way They denied the negro man and woman basic human right The European nation of Christians worked the negro slave from sun up to sun down without pay gave them ungodly food and conditioned them to live in poor living condition Taught the negro man to become a whoremonger to produce a stronger slave man to sell These Europeans Christians also rape woman men and child and called themselves the child of god I still ask the question which god Oh by the way Satan is a god too This nation of European Christians or godly people used the negro child a gator bait how godly is this action This is truly the new Egypt and this Pharaoh is more ruthless than the first although similar These Christians continue to show who they are with a continued onslaught of the negro man with countless murder by their Christian police force and citizen This European or Caucasian Christian doctrine is not for those of you who truly believe in the Most High and the true Messiah if you want to survive what ‚Äô s about to happen come out of her This is proof that the earth is given into the hand of the wicked The European Caucasian Christians doesn ‚Äô t understand that what ever a man reap he will also sew If you think that the true GOD Most High is going to allow you to get away with vile violation of his word you got another thing coming ‚Äú Prepare slaughter for his child for the iniquity of their father ‚Äù What ever you put into the universe prepare to get double because the Most High doesn ‚Äô t like how harshly you dealt with his people Furthermore the negro that perpetuate these belief in the community will die with her in the last day because you partake in her SINS By the way Easu ‚Äú IS NOT ‚Äù the Caucasian or White man Just remember the earth in given into the hand of the wicked

ranfis mejia	Here are just a few of hundred of verse from the Quran where muhamMAD order people to be killed if he were alive today he d be the leader of ISIS Quran 2 191 193 And kill them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out And Al Fitnah disbelief or unrest is worse than killing but if they desist then lo Allah is forgiving and merciful And fight them until there is no more Fitnah disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah and worship is for Allah alone But if they cease let there be no transgression except against Az Zalimun the polytheist and wrong doer etc Translation is from the Noble Quran The verse prior to this 190 refers to fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their home and family The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare however since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversary In fact the verse urge offensive warfare in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city which they later did Verse 190 thus mean to fight those who offer resistance to Allah s rule ie Muslim conquest The use of the word persecution by some Muslim translator is disingenuous the actual Arabic word for persecution idtihad and oppression are not used instead of fitna Fitna can mean disbelief or the disorder that result from unbelief or temptation A strict translation is sedition meaning rebellion against authority the authority being Allah This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned until religion is for Allah ie unbeliever desist in their unbelief Verse 193 plainly say that fighting is sanctioned even if the fitna cease This is about religious order not real persecution Quran 2 244 Then fight in the cause of Allah and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all thing Quran 2 216 Fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you But Allah knoweth and ye know not Not only doe this verse establish that violence can be virtuous but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self defense since the audience wa obviously not under attack at the time From the Hadith we know that this verse wa narrated at a time that Muhammad wa actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravan for loot Quran 3 56 As to those who reject faith I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help Quran 3 151 Soon shall We cast terror into the heart of the Unbelievers for that they joined companion with Allah for which He had sent no authority This speaks directly of polytheist yet it also includes Christians since they believe in the Trinity ie what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be joining companion to Allah Quran 4 74 Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah be he slain or be he victorious on him We shall bestow a vast reward The martyr of Islam are unlike the early Christians who were led meekly to the slaughter These Muslims are killed in battle a they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah This is the theological basis for today s suicide bomber Quran 4 76 Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah‚Ä¶ Quran 4 89 They but wish that ye should reject Faith a they do and thus be on the same footing a they But take not friend from their rank until they flee in the way of Allah From what is forbidden But if they turn renegade seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friend or helper from their rank Quran 4 95 Not equal are those of the believer who sit at home except those who are disabled by injury or are blind or lame etc and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their life Allah ha preferred in grade those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their life above those who sit at home Unto each Allah ha promised good Paradise but Allah ha preferred those who strive hard and fight above those who sit at home by a huge reward This passage criticizes peaceful Muslims who do not join in the violence letting them know that they are le worthy in Allah s eye It also demolishes the modern myth that Jihad doesn t mean holy war in the Quran but rather a spiritual struggle Not only is this Arabic word mujahiduna used in this passage but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual since the physically disabled are given exemption The Hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man s protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad which would not make sense if it meant an internal struggle Quran 4 104 And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain a you suffer pain Is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self defense Quran 5 33 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hand and their foot should be cut off on opposite side or they should be imprisoned this shall be a a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement Quran 8 12 I will cast terror into the heart of those who disbelieve Therefore strike off their head and strike off every fingertip of them No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle The target of violence are those who disbelieve further defined in the next verse 13 a defy and disobey Allah Nothing is said about self defense In fact the verse in sura 8 were narrated shortly after a battle provoked by Muhammad who had been trying to attack a lightly armed caravan to steal good belonging to other people wake up people

Mike The Stand	If you take a good look at all the lie deception and lawlessness that continues to pour from the democrat you have to state without fear of contradiction that patriotic Americans have a DUTY I shout again a DUTY to vote out in every possible state and position every single democrat To have one democrat in a position of power is one too many Americans do your duty to save your country because if you give democrat power they will destroy America There is no time to sit on the fence it is time to save America VOTE THEM OUT
