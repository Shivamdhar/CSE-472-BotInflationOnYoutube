Michael Turner	Back in late July early August I watched all of the Overwatch League final If you watch them on Twitch and have your account linked to your Blizzard account which I did then you would unlock a series of spray in Overwatch That never happened and every time I contacted Blizzard Customer Support I got constantly told There s a problem on our end and our engineer are working on a fix This went on for week and then they just all of a sudden said Sorry nothing we can do Also in August I attempted to purchase the Genji Special All Star Skin For some reason I wa unable to and when I contacted customer support they just said Oh it must be your fault we can t help you sorry I even talked to a Manager Andrew C and he couldn t have been more dismissive of my issue or treat me in any way other then trying to get me to shut up and go away Blizzard I love Overwatch it s one of my favorite game One of the major reason I play is because I love collecting all the cosmetic item Your dumpster fire of a customer service department ha left a sour taste in my mouth and I can not justify spending any more money on Blizzard Entertainment product knowing this is the sort of treatment I will receive
Itchlord	Here s an idea a control map based on the world cup where the image you see on your menu screen if you open overwatch a I am writing this is the point That would look awesome IMO

Paul Petru Alexandru Cazacliu	Most of the player aren t playing just 1 multiplayer game so OW isn t losing to the Battle Royale genre Personally besides Overwatch constantly Dirty Bomb Paladins the new City Battle Virtual Earth and Mass Effect Andromeda Multiplayer and that s giving to each of them a longer life If you are playing just one you ll be bored to the death very soon but if there s variation the life span is multiplied by each other game added

Reainny	Where s my hero 29
Carl Marinas	The viewer would be a help on catching hacker specifically wall hack and aimbots huge feature
Malacite	The change are already up on the PTR and I like them but I still think the best thing they could do for Mercy is remove Res altogether and have her focus on switching stance similar to Lucio But where she d differ is swapping her staff s function would no longer be instant but take a few second and in exchange for that buff the power of both mode IMO it would give her a good level of micromanagement and really emphasize the need for the player to read the situation correctly a those few second where you re stuck swapping the beam on your staff could cost a fight

Mario Petkov	Mercy Buff Mercy main dream come true
dani machause	Buff for Mercy NO it just half reverting the nerf she had month ago Ok so now we have the same useless Ult a before We can not play her in ranked because there is allways an Ana or Moira in the team a the main healer and people allways ask for Lucio or Zen because of their great ults but because Mercys ult is garbage and do NOTHING even with the buf if a team play her they are doing le than with other healer and it very sad If only her Ult wa like much more HPS to single target that would be a wise step to make Mercy more impactful and strong Maybe they should focus her a the best Single Target healer and emphasize that with her ult At the end Mercy need a rework im a Main Mercy since the beta and she is in a very bad spot right now hope they realize about it and do something at least more than half revert a nerf
Corey Franklin	Talon tank powered by the cube that Talon stole from the train in the McCree comic The Route 66 payload ha been updated to an opened container with cool air effect but it used to be closed The container ha a striking similar reference to D va ‚Äô s Meka design exclusive to her and no other Meka pilot McCree is on the front poster for the Blizzcon advertisement I think that we will receive a hero or animated short relating to this topic at Blizzcon

nickdanger12345	Great I m glad they re focusing on esports instead of adding new feature I don t know something a insane a a NEW event gamemode in 2 year Consider this a full price game with loot box that is also making a fortune off esports should have more than just extra cosmetic Cosmetics that they actively make you GAMBLE for It s just scummy especially after they fixed the drop rate well after the game had left it prime They created a problem and then actively withheld the solution until they maximized profit and then people turn around and act like they re saint for doing it Don t even get me started on how they gate content behind arbitrary period of time in order to spur your sense of urgency to again maximize profit Yet to this day they can t be bothered to make new game mode for event or fix some of the blatant issue with ranked People need to stop for a second and remember what come before Blizzard Activision

Politikz Official	Ok so You guy co designed destiny so can we please get a colab I d love to play a character that ha different ult option like old symmetra and could choose between the 3 different type of ult in destiny 2 Like void grenade or the sword thing dawnbreaker Or the electric field The sword ult could be like hanzo s dragon but faster 1 hit of damage instead of continuous The void grenade could be like bastion s ult but unable to move while doing so like pharah s ult in the sky but you d get like a small amount of shield to stay alive longer The electric field could provide continuous damage to a certain area like Hammond s ult but not instant damage or death to squishy hero I just thought it d be a cool idea Could be like solider 76 when regular shooting

WarlordSquerk	A lot of really awesome stuff there Shame they re going for a valk buff instead of a revert and patch and no mention of bastion So I guess I ll still avoid playing the game for the most part But that said a quick dev update buff to several hero people have been asking for for a long time the viewer tool eventually coming to my local game A lot of good there A big step in the right direction
La Pal	Sooo this new spectator mode Will we get to have it in OWL a well And will it be locked behind the all access pas
Negative Ives	I hope the reaper buff is a fix to his teleport Its fine that he can t be detected a quickly a before but the major problem I have with it a it stand is that he is a sitting duck if anyone see his destination I m not saying make it so it instantaneous though a a Reaper main that would be fantastic for me but even having le aura would be better suited for him Here are other thing I would like them to look at but not necessarily needed buff fix for him Teleport Mid Air the option if your quick enough to save yourself from falling off a cliff from a random Lucio boop Less Shotgun spread or piercing damage through shield 5 10 percent 3 second invincibility upon Shadow Step to fix the issue with him being a sitting duck Damage Resistance while using his ultimate 10 percent Okay I cheated on this one and took it from the forum Since he is shifting in and out of Wraith form while using his ultimate it make sense to have some small damage resistance

Dwevy	I m probably in the minority but I struggle to play overwatch due to many reason I m pretty mediocre at it and I do struggle against class that stun me and teleport such a genji But the one thing I wish could be toned down is the visual clutter Moira s ultimate just make an already chaotic game for me seem even more overwhelming

3lit3gn0m3	Nice sound like a tough system to implement Not to detract from it but please fix the daily arcade slot It barely run half the available mode and really doesn t seem arcadey at all As a kid the arcade meant variety and while I understand not having ALL mode 24 7 right now the variance is extremely minimal For example having 2 event mode and the other 3 ALL being mystery It tell me that Blizzard is more concerned with popular mode for all slot than giving niche fun mode more chance like 6v6 elim 1v1 duel pop up a lot or even too much at time I ve been asking about this for month and honestly don t think I should expect anything
Kaleb cline	Omg this sound amazing I ‚Äô d love to just watch the player I love

A kleiman22	LOOK AT HIS HAND THO
CephasRed VS.	Hey Jeff Overwatch Dev Team do you have any plan in the future with any work on Reinhardt The reason I ask is because I m a Reinhardt main and after playing a him for 2 year i ve noticed that his defense is getting weaker and weaker with each new hero coming in Basically his armor doesnt seem a strong a before For example Bastion can take him down in 1 2 second and Moira s overpowered depletion ball and beam take him down in no time flat In short could Rein get an armor upgrade and have his shield block all attack physical and energy based with of course keeping the shield health bar a is Offensively he s great but defensively a of right now he doesn t feel like a tank at all just an overgrown soft easy target

Iguana_Exorcist	Does anyone else feel that Blizz is too focused on the Overwatch League and World cup and not so much on developing and expanding the game and lore They haven t progressed the story in the Animated Shorts since the Infiltrated short There wa the Zarya Sombra comic but that only really provided depth and background for Zarya We ve only had exposition and the gap between the last short D Va and the short before that Rein wa over half a year The production of hero is 3 4 a year and if the game is to stay current it need more hero to keep the game fresh and to prevent the meta from getting stale Thats just my two cent tho and if you think otherwise try and change my mind and see thing from your perspective TL DR Blizz are focused too much on the OW League and World Cup and not enough on the game and lore Change my mind cue meme

Landon 247	Do you think it would be OP if while you were being healed by mercy getting hit with a one shot from a Hanzo or widow headshot a tire a Doomfist punch or anything that would kill you in one hit it left the person being healed with exactly one health instead of dying

MLGvolcano 12	overwatch battle royale idea so basically you would have all the map in the game combined into one You can choose any character from the game that you want they would have the same health the only way you could get ability or weapon shield is from ground loot also the ammo for the weapon it ‚Äô s self would be with it ex junk rat gernade launcher would come with ammo called gernades or whatever creative name you could come up with ex you would be able to pick up junkrats trap or bomb a an ability for a one time use or reinhardts or bridget ‚Äô s shield for a one time use
