MARK TULLY	When L.S.Shoen was thrown out of his company(uhaul) by his rogue children he used the comparatively small amount of money they  gave him to buy a string of properties .He must have figured the properties we're just' like uhaul trailers in that as long as you made the needed repairs they would produce income theoretically forever. That is what Mr Fitzpatrick is saying to me.  ,
