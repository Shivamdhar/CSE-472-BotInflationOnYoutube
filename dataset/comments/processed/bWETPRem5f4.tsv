chris X	With the exception to entrepreneurship. Many millionaires and billionaires did not attend collage, Some even dropped out. The market will soon be saturated with collage degrees making jobs harder and harder to find. Learning and education is a beautiful thing.  Knowledge is power and education will take you places, However society need to lose the collage is the only way mindset because its wrong on so many levels. "formal education will make you a living self-education will make you a fortune.
