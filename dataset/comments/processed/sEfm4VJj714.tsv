MysticUmbreon	Alright so I don t get 1k comment about Gyarados not getting Crunch use bite There you go problem solved I thought for sure it got crunch oops
Lab Rats Battles	The one thing that make Staraptor so great it s the only starter bird to learn a Fighting type move and I agree with you he look so rad
thedazzlingshell101	I feel like if you don t want to use Gyardos Floatzel would be another great option Its early on at the Valley Windworks a a Buzel sorry if my spelling is off but once you evolve it it becomes a rather cool Pokemon Plus it not 4X weak to electric type attack
Timmynator 9000	Torterra Floatzel Staraptor Garchomp Luxray HM slave or Lucario
Gage Waltner	My biggest complaint about pokemon you tuber is that they all have 1 2 minute intro that are completely stoppable anyone else feel
Rick Mannion	Dude piplup and turtwig are both trash everyone know chimchars the best not opinion change my mind
barrowkade	Torterra is my favourite starter of all time but it not a good a the others
CrazyMangoz	Here is my altered version of this team it is made to include all the HMs to get through the game tell me what you think Torterra woodhammer earthquake crunch rock slide Staraptor close combat fly cut return Gallade psycho cut close combat leaf blade night slash Gyarados earthquake waterfall ice fang surf Kangaskhan strength rock climb rock smash rest scrappy for kangaskhans ability
UltimateHero128	Torterra wa my Pearl starter I have no regret Infernape wa Diamond Empoleon wa Platinum
Noah Tackett	Isn t dragon dance a gen 5 move Also Bidoof Perfect HM slave
Tristan Stoner	Instead of lickilicky i went with Blissey
Andrew Shaw	I think Luxray s better than Lickilicky
Zuzumita	Lickilicky is a really good pokemon imo It get access to stab Explosion A feat only possible for Lickilicky iirc which can KO most pokemon in the game and ha a really diverse movepool however A physical set is what work for me so wew You can run a special variant if you want Also it s decently bulky so it s likely to survive lot of attack a long a they re not fighting type Held Items should really only be either a silk scarf or leftover maybe even expert belt thinking For move i d suggest Return Most reliably powerful stab move it ha Next to explosion Explosion For all reason above Also for when Lickilicky s about to faint A last ditch effort Power Whip Great power and deal with pesky rock type The last move can be anything from Fire Punch to Gyro ball tbh I would recommend fire punch flamethrower though to deal with steel type For a special variant you could use Return unfortunately Lickilicky doesn t really get a good normal stab special move apart from hyper beam so you ll have to make do Hyper Beam Basically a lower powered le risky explosion although it leaf you vulnerable for a turn Water Pulse Surf Same reason for power whip deal with rock ground type Flamethrower or if you re feeling risky Focus Blast for steel type Lickilicky ha always been one of my favorite pokemon and it s for all of the reason above and it s really underrated the only thing I don t like is that it s really slow but that s not that big of a deal tbh also explosion is a fairly difficult TM to obtain in platinum but trust me it s worth it Anyway those are just the set I use feel free to use them yourself or modify them
Gabriel Silva Rocha	Hippowdown is also a great filler option for the team btw
Random human	My team is İnfernape Staraptor Garchomp Lucario Gastrodon Leafeon
scizor squad	Turtwig wa my first and one of my favorite starter so the beginning trigger me but it ’ s ok
Broseph	But I love torterra
Infinite Bacon	Just completed a run with this end team Decided to play a bit faster than normal and managed to beat Cynthia within 22 10 of game time a pretty good time for me I like to explore more typically But due to the speed at which I wa playing I didn t end up filling out the entire moveset for each Pokémon a by the end the highest level wa my level 52 Gyarados Thankfully a it turn out 6 dragon dance is just enough to sweep Cynthia s entire lineup In other word had a lot of fun trying this out
greek1237	You hate the grass Turtle It wa my favorite of the gen 4 starter
Ganon Tice	I love torterra
Draco roblox bad piggies more	Lickilicky Expert Belt Ability Own Tempo Swords Dance Cut Earthquake Zen Headbutt
kenny chen	It s ehhh
Oliver Cloezoff	WHY the hate not just from you but people in general I don t understand
Ash Ketchum	You don ’ t have a good mix of physical and special attacker Almost the whole team ha better attack stat than special att stat Also it ’ s isn ’ t really great to have Pokémon to share type So I wouldn ’ t have 2 normal and 2 flying type So I ’ d swap gyarados and lickilicky Swap lickilicky with porygon eventually porygon Z which you can get before finishing the game And swap gyarados with a special attacking water type Perhaps vaporeon
Billy Creates	the moment u have diamond but not platinum
Willem Wijaya	You suck a pokemon game
Jack Patterson	But Torterra is great
Garnetore Gladiator	It ’ s funny that his favourite starter is the only one worse then torterra
mukesh md	What about Ariel ace instead of takedown
Youssef Lataoui	How do you get past heart home city the second time you get to it
yanniek pijper games ypg	I actually like torterra
Meta Knight	Yay i love torterra
Caiden Magill	Starraptor is my favorit bird
Sweet Tea	Lmao u guy are hypocrite saying staraptor and houndoom is bad in other sinnoh vids and then completely contradicting that

Arry Reddy	Luxrayy
Gavin Mauk	I recently did a Normal type run of Diamond and I had a fast Clefable that knew Flamethrower Ice Beam Thunderbolt and Hyper Beam Keeping it just a couple level above the trainer had it going first and destroying I also ran Bibarel practically Water type starter Staraptor so good and neutralizes Fighting weakness Blissey Toxic etc Lopunny basically my Fighting type knew Dig Girafarig Psychic and Ghost type move special attacker
Roxas	Torterra is love
Nedu Egeh	10 50 10 53 I m glad I m not the only person who think way too many people sleep on Lickilicky
Takato 214	What do you think of dusknoir
Moises Cañeca	I had a similar team right now except I have Lucario for lickylicky and gardevoir for gallade
Caspar Alderson	I m skint but those tee and hoodies are sweet
Jeddy Steve	I think that Gastrodon is better due to only one weakness and ha good bulk with usable special attack I know it s a repeat type but having a good water type that can also be a backup ground type to Torttera Also it s got early access a well a having surf which mean you don t need a Lickylicky on your team since even though I like Lickylicky A lot of people don t Also keep in mind that Gastrodon can learn ice beam so Garchomp won t sweep your team Even though Garrados I probably spelt this wrong because I m too lazy to look it up can learn ice fang it s not a good a ice beam
ChillMoogle	Both Gastrodon and Snorlax have slower speed 90 of Torterras segment you talked about it ’ s passable 56 speed
Kinsai	I would recommend replacing Take Down with Return once Staraptor reach max happiness It s the strongest Normal attack move without any drawback
Henry Rubio-Ventura	Lickilicky is a physical attacker not a special attacker
Max Ettling	Sinnoh ha the best starter
noa Kastle	Why not curse instead of crunch
ProKobe	Torterra is my favorite Pokémon
x Hasan	Redo Infernape The original one suck
Jared Kinz	i used torterra in my first game and used Torterra Staraptor Luxray Machamp Palkia Poliwhirl and eventually Poliwrath idek what i wa thinking
Starter Paks	My torterra is always bomb and super fast
LegenderyFox	Good night well I m Brazilian and I m learning English and I do not understand everything but can I put subtitle Well thank you for reading
Luke Chan	shouldn t staraptor know how to use roost
Joy Chowdhury	U still need to make a Venusuar Typhlosion Feraligtyr and Swampert edition
Inferno Burns	I agree Stataptor is my second favorite bird after Pidgeot
Ben Naughton	Why Torterra is actually good not to spite you or anything just that it s one of my favourite starter Please don t hate me For starter pun intended even though Torterra is weak to Infernape the best Infernape can do for a while is flame wheel which is easily tankable thanks to it s bulky defence Yes special attack cripple it but would you actually see an Infernape use a special move Second move like Giga Drain can be helpful a it sacrifice a bit of power for the ability to heal Curse could also be viable a it s already slow a heck why not just up it s other stats instead I used only grottle to beat gardenia using curse so it s a good early game option What I m saying is that not all pokemon have to only have attacking move Synthesis could also be another option Third many pokemon could be used to build a team around a the vast amount of TMs that can be put on certain pokemon cover most of Torterra s weakness Personally getting an altaria in this gen is extremely useful a it can be taught move like ice beam and earthquake giving it to Gallade it kind of a waste a fighting move cover some of the thing that earthquake is super effective againts Steel rock etc Even if you Have some other weakness your fire type or in my instance a clefable with flamethrower can deal with those threat for you Finally I think that torterra is a pokemon for more advanced player to use It s tanky nature make it difficult to grasp for the le experienced player making Infernape a good a it is kind of an easy mode for the game Understanding that not all pokemon are fast sweeper make it easier to appreciate how good Torterra is Not saying to don t expect all pokemon to be fast sweeper it s just your preferance I hope that you appreciate what I wa saying I m not trying to make you look bad or anything I m just spreading mu opinion out a bit Thanks Btw I reaaaallly love your channel 3
Anthony Gulick	This dude is so biased never seen anyone hate torterra this much Going to say it ’ s the worst starter of all time is complete BS
Jose Salas	Wouldn t it be better to carry curse instead of crunch
Justine Mariano	Galade is MOST VALUABLE POKEMON
Rossy james	Wow
Judith D	Yes Torterra My young self who knew nothing about type actually used torterra to beat the Ice gym Torterra is beast
Tyren Prowell	My Torterra had helped me beat the kento leader in the pwt torterra exactly got a good move set stone Edge dragon rage leaf storm Nd earthquake
Amolik blesson Singh	Well I think that lickilicky is actually equal to snorlax
Louwrens	I always go for Shinx on the first route it is A not really good at first but once it had evolved into luxio this thing rock and it final stage luxray is A really good mon a well and is in my opinion A great addition to the team
MadMike96	since i had diamond and Platinum I ve sent a chimchar and Turtwig to platinum so I ve got Empoleon Torterra Infernape Electivire Staraptor and Gliscor you didn t mention any trading pokemon
Fyntom2	Torterra is completely my favorite can t believe this
Michael Hendrix	I m tryna figure out if you know adam22 he reference someone he call mystic when he talking about pokemon go if you are part of the rope gang then that make my day
Rami Saab	Magnazone 😩😩😩

OpErAtiOn Seiged	Highscool dxd anyone
Hugo Santos	Licklicky BOI
Fiona Wallace	Torrtera is the best starter So screw you
Damon Frey	Is the a possibility of a samurott black 1 team
FaceOff Power	My team would be Torterra Crobat Gyarados Houndoom Medicham Porygon Z
Marielena Potts	Torterra is actually better than Empoleon you and HDEvee really need to stop labelling it a bad all because of speed But it s based off a turtle Correction tortoise and yes there is a big difference between the two that s cool I get the concept If you like the design that s dope The problem lie with it speed Did your microphone glitch out at some point and you didn t know it cut off some of your dialogue or you intentionally or unintentionally edit out what you said after talking about the design and before going back to the stats or did you actually just try to sweep the design s explanation for the low speed under the rug and hope that no one notice Complaining about speed understanding the reason why and ignoring it and going straight back to complaining just look pathetic The problem is it get outran by literally everything oh yeah there definitely aren t any slower Pokemon out there and ALL Pokemon that don t have high speed are hopeless this sentence is sarcastic by the way It s not only a TORTOISE again not a turtle but it s also a CONTINENT Both are known for moving slow and continent can cause limitless amount of destruction no matter how fast they move And you STILL expect these two combined to be a fast a at least a little kid on a bike or scooter And you clearly never heard of the story the tortoise and the hare Also there are move and item that deal with it speed stop labelling slow a bad
Allen Duncan	I got to say togekiss is better than staraptor can support take hit and dish out damage plus serene grace awesome movepool
Chris Cooper, random man of music	Sounds like you re saying Brek Brek instead of Brick Break
Goran Yugi Dubravic	My team in diamond wa Torterra Luxray Staraptor Floatzol Rapidash and Lucario
theRJschannel	Suggestions for the BW Samurott and Serperior Samurott Team 1 Samurott 2 Stoutland 3 Swoobat 4 Krookodile 5 Darmanitan 6 Ferrothorn Serperior team 1 Serperior 2 Stoutland 3 Swoobat 4 Seismitoad 5 Darmanitan 6 Vanillux There s not too many in the original BW game but I grew up with these so I know some good coverage with these guy And Mystic if you re wondering why I chose some over others you might ve thought of here are some reason Swoobat ha a base 114 speed compaired to Sigilyphs 97 speed Sure Woobat ha much le Sp Atk than Sigilyph but it still ha some nice STAB move for the game and can do away with Bianca s Cheren s Pignite Emboar and Cheren s Serperior Seismitoad is a great water and ground type while not having much in term of coverage it shuts down Elisa s Volt Switch tactic greatly and Tympole evolves rather fast Vanillux because flying type coverage I can t think of any other but I would appreciate if you gave these some thought
Otto Kapanen	I went with Torterra Luxray Gastrodon Drifblim Drapion Froslass
Rhyperior Ranger	I love Torterra My team is Torterra Gastrodon Togekiss Drapion Magmortar Lucario
Dylan Ward	why doe barry have a torterra on his team
Master MoJo	Torterra Magmortar Gryrados Staraptor Garchomp Electivire

Eduarte's Productions	At 7 10 why doe Barry have Torterra He s suppose to have Empoleon
ArchetypeGotoh	Tropius fly flash strength cut Bibarel Surf Waterfall Rock Smash Rock Climb
Surinder Garg	You can use garchomp
muncher videos	4 gen gamer am part pilup people
Slovakian Mapping	My god how many video do I have to comment if the have the defence to tank then u don ’ t need speed if u can easily take hit then speed don ’ t matter
JimmyXP	Turtwig wa my first starter in pearl he a beast
Brian Ludwig	How is Mega Houndoom a disservice I don t see anything wrong with it and the fact that it got a mega is a streak of luck

Michael 5	Floatzel would be a good water type too It ha a great speed and attack
Joan Aguayo Planell	Okay let s tear apart this crap while I watch Off a good start Complains about torterra s speed Never even considers Rock Polish Return is THAT much better Gallade ha completely redundant move with Torterra Also extremely overrated Gyarados is good Guess even a broken clock is indeed right twice a day Lickilicky suck Having a million TMs available won t matter with that mediocre attacking stats If you want a tanky attacker just bring Bronzong and consider using Trick Room to fix Torterra s speed without having to invest in the Rock Polish TM not like you will need it for anything but I guess it open a slot for Torterra to bring Stealth Rock to the table wich is always a good thing to have Houndoom is SHIT For the love of Arceus just use Garchomp instead you can even get him right away after the second gym in Platinum He got banned from competitive for a reason Please don t ever bring up again this trash pokemon who couldn t even use a mega evolution right
Nick Ellis	Yeah I m not paying nearly £50 for a hoodie
Connor Stevens	Staraptor is Both normal flying Gyarados is flying and lickilicky is normal ergo I can ’ t use Staraptor or Gyarados Lickilicky Sorry Replacements None of the type of Torterra Houndoom Or Gallade Staraptor or Gyarados Lickilicky
YoBoi Nebby	Torterra is always going to be my favourite starter of all time i love it so much mainly because of nostalgia but still and i like standing up for the under dog When I play sinnoh I usually use Torterra Staraptor Floatzel Mismagius Yanmega and the last one is never really the same but usually it just like a skuntank or something
Namenlos	My Team Torterra Luxray Staraptor Garchomp Weavile Lucario

Jose Sosa	Dat best starter edtition 💯
Dudeldani	Torterra Houndoom Togekiss Golduck Weavil And magnemites last evolution

King Doko	What about Togekiss 😭😭
Beth Smith	Torterra CARRIED my platinum run tbf I wa 8 so wasn t focusing on team comp but I used Torterra Staraptor swapped for Giratina later Tentacruel Golem and then a random mix for the last 2 slot
Jason Dodds	Torterra isn t bad mystic I know people are entitled to their opinion but no one care you dont like it
Roald Gaasbeek	Torterra is my most favorite starter pokemon ever
Edwart Norton	I just begun my game a few day ago currently team is Grotle Buizel Gligar and Togepi and i wan na get a Croagunk A good sp atk option for my six party pokemón
Jay Conic	The team I used for Platinum wa Torterra Staraptor Garchomp Gallade Vaporeon Houndoom
Iron Wolf Man	houndoom just doesnt learn good special move until late
QuietStar silence	I always use floatzel instead of gyrados i just like it best
roke tataroğlu	Torterra is one of the realest nigga
NightFly	Honestly I love Infernape My team would be 1 Infernape 2 Luxray 5 Garchomp 4 Staraptor 5 Mega Lucario
Tempted Badger	5 ad on a 13 min video
Lati 312	Did you cover all the HMs cut Surf
Italo Caycho Torres	The filler Pokemon could be Garchomp and honestly it s not very hard to find A moveset should be Dragon Claw Dig Earthquake Fire Fang Slash Crunch
Olly Tropics	My team for this team game wa Empoleon Straraptor Misdreveus Toxicroak Lopunny Luxuray
Vince Eggimann	TURTWIG IS GOD
Thomas Page	I used a Torterra during my own real run of Sinnoh Diamond I can ’ t know what the team wa for sure because the file got deleted but based on a Battle Revolution team I still have it should have been 1 Torterra Frenzy Plant Cut Leaf Storm Earthquake 2 Gastrodon Water Pulse Surf Muddy Water Blizzard 3 Drifblim Psychic Ominous Wind Defog Shadow Ball 4 Luxray Crunch Thunder Fang Scary Face Discharge 5 Starraptor Close Combat Fly Brave Bird Endeavor 6 Bibarel Strength Rock Climb Waterfall Rock Smash I have no idea how I beat the game
Reaper of Things	Licklicky The f ck is that I know every Pokemon in the Dex and I ve never heard of that Pokemon the only one similar to it in name is Lickitung and Lickilicky is this a Gen 8 spoiler
Safal Muhammed	i love torterra more than infernape by a teensy bit
Ilija	Brick brick U can t say break 😂
Elijah Toombs	Wouldn t return be better than takedown
Tuvya Maeir	Staraptor doesn t learn Fly by level up like there is so much fact checking in this video you should have done and it s really embarrassing Forgetting to record something in audio and making up for it in editing is one thing Forgetting to double check your fact and then trying to make up for them by saying Whoops in the comment or something after it s uploaded Come on man
Kevin Bibow	I would teach staraptor return instead of licklicky
Nerdy Neko Girl	Can u do 1 for infernape
Night Zebra	As much a I like these What about a team that only consists of pkm from said region not including pkm like magikarp that can be found in every region
Matthew Raley	torterra is my favorite starter of all time
Nick den Toom	Since i don t like Doubling Up on weakness i would replace Gyarados with Gastrodon and Houndoom with Luxray
Champion DarkBlaze!	This wa awesome Torterra is my fav Sinnoh starter and in def gon na try this Team one day But a for right now with the current playthrough Im doing of platinum my team is Torterra Staraptor Spiritomb Garchomp Lucario Magmortar The final four being Pokémon I ’ ve never used in an actual playthrough before I ’ ve used all these Pokémon but just not the final four in a platinum run And this team ha been great Other member I used previously during this run were Floatzel Luxray Kricketune hilarious in game cry and first time using one
Nicholas Walleston	I mean this team is alright You could also give torterra a quick claw like any sane person would and teach it curse to be a physical wall Also lickylicky is more of a slight physical attacker than special attacker So if ice beam is going to be the main ice move besides ice fang on gyrados well good luck with the nuclear attacker garchomp Also I played diamond recently and I had no problem making a team up It s not impossible to make a team for sinnoh around torterra I had brongzong with levitate toxicroak with dry skin clefable milotic and some flying type But it isn t impossible because of one gallade and houndoom
Mr Pokemon master	You need to start a new draft league to celebrate let go game in the draft league you could use only original 151 Pokemon it would be awesome
Roger Ly	Just copy off chuggaaconroy ‘ steam and you will be gold
keller blair	When will the inferape team be out
Peterson Byrd	You should include the stat trainer Marley Mira Buck Riley Cheryl
James	Level 60 Gyarados dragon dance waterfall ice fang another move of your choice Holding leftover I swept Cynthia s entire team with that
King Ping Bell	Just use Drifblim a your flier because you can just use stockpile and minimize then baton pas in battle to win easily and then obviously use fly for the hm
Owaim Azam	You are the best
CrazyGamer 101	I dont really lime sinnoh game
Haziq saiman	Tbf it s better if you replace lickilicky with magnezone
Turtlelochy Gamez	Its meant to be slow cause it a tortoise yes im captain obvious and it carrying a mountain oncit back think about the struggle of his everyday life
Vasisht Srinivasan	My torterra team wa Torterra Weavile Rapidash Drapion Golduck Staraptor
El Carlos	I d sooner put garbodor in my team than that pink abomination
Vled Hoccain	use M I L O T I C instead
mohit kalasuwa	Please do serperior edition gen 5
Dalton Roe	gyarados is the real mvp because it can destroy cynthia s entire team the moveset should be waterfall dragon dance earthquake and ice fang set up when spiritomb is out and after 6 dragon dance you can destroy her team
Kinta02	Presumably another episode of bad choice falsehood and misinformation so let go
G 92	Torterra s actually my favourite Sinnoh starter Key is to run Curse a few time he ll tank like mental Yeah speed s an issue but to paraphrase the anime You re dealing with a defensive type hence why Paul s wa a beast and Ash s well wasn t
Brian Patino	Everything is cool and all but uno to beat the game u need TMs like cut rock climb and rock smash
Hugh Jazz Hole	Guys don ’ t use Take Down for Staraptor Use STAB Return instead Trust me your Staraptor will be OP once you max out it ’ s friendship with you
Zac	how in the fuck do you choose delphox over torterra
cheezywiz2	2 normal
Prajwal Dhule	I used lickylicky in platinum befor and it reallyyyy good
EmperorOfTigers	Would have been nice if you offered a DP replacement for Gallade like you did on the Empoleon video
devin johnson	I want to use this mega altaria in my rom hack with pixelite BUT MAN staraptor make it hard to let go a my flyer His attack surpasses it being an early pokemon which are usually weak or blah
TKCool TV - Gaming and More	YES FINALLY
Killer Kirby	Sweet you showed some love to my boi Lickilicky
Abel Munoz	turtwig is one of my all time favorite starter
Random Pokégamer	I love torterra
Rcs493	I ve never actually used Lickylicky before Can t wait to try it out
Star Spangled Gaming	If you had made the original best sinnoh team with Infernape use platinum pokemon like you did for this video how would it be different
Pokemon maniac 33 Hillarious	Yay I predicted gyrados
Guy with no subscribers	The turtwig line is ugly
Silver Nicktendo 64	I m thinking of getting Platinum again and making a new team for Infernape How doe this team sound Infernape Floatzel Roserade Bronzong Garchomp Either Luxray or Dusknoir
Elizabeth Ingalls	I do like this team It s different And I love Houndoom One thing how come most of the set are purely attacking set No Toxic Thunder Wave Confuse Ray Leech Seed etc Those move are so much fun Everyone ha different playing style though so I can t really fault that too much For Houndoom it Attack is decent but I d stick with more Special move He can learn Sludge Bomb and SOLARBEAM The latter requires set up but it s still pretty cool Iron Tail is just not very good on it it s not a very good move in general and I d personally only use it for STAB in gen 4 Thunder Fang isn t really strong enough imo although it s good for the middle of the journey Torterra is good It s just a physical tank It get Curse too a decent set up move that complement it stats pretty well No Swords Dance on Gallade Are you serious At least you gave Gyarados Dragon Dance Lickilicky is one of my least favourite gen 4 Pokémon but I actually liked it inclusion here I like seeing le popular Pokémon being used in team
Jaden Storm	Saw lickilicki and shut it off Dude come on wtf
ChingChongChing DokiDoki	Hey Mystic how about Best Teams for Pokemon Colosseum and XD gale of darkness
LilJoeFromKokomo	That Platinum remake better be done on the Switch I ’ ll give Nintendo all my money at that point
sea dragon	Heres my team Infernape Starraptor Gardevoir Gyarados Bibarel or lickylicky Giratina
Sarah Gorrie	sob torterra is my favourite
iBenjamin1000	Lickilicky suggestion sword dance game corner brick break earthquake and normal STAB Can get power whip by level up Give it explosion by level up I think for a great big chuckle Fire thunder punch by one of the tutor you get before e4 You could put surf instead of sword dance since you already have an attack booster
Ronald Rhodes	My boy lickilicky FINALLY got some recognition Thank you so much 😭😭🤩🤩
Yahkov thegreat	Move set for Staraptor is trash Better one would be Brave Bird Return Close Combat U turn Personally I would run EQ over bite on Gyarados and Night Slash over EQ on Gallade Lickilicki is just an odd choice I would go with something cool like a porygon Z or eevee lution of choice
Jimmy nunya	I ve never played gen 4 Really hoping they did a remake
Matthew Roberts	Lickilicky Hallelujah I love it som much 😍😍😍
atharv pande	Why not stone edge instead of rock spide
Super Luck	Close combat on two different pokemon Crunch bite on two different pokemon and two flying AND normal type Not a very balanced team overall Platinum ha such a wide variety of pokemon to choose from and you have repeating type and move on this team which is unnecessary A better team comp would be Torterra Starraptor Gallade Houndoom Rotom Vaporeon Less repeating weakness and more Stab coverage
blackdragonwtf	Are you going to do best team for black and white 1 2
sam kul	Remove lickylicky and add THE PERENNIAL SLAVE Bibarel can learn most HMS and if you tank him a little he can take some hit in clutch situation Best sack mon period
Marcus Vinicius de Alvarenga	My Gen 4 Team 1 Torterra 2 Lucario 3 Staraptor 4 Glaceon 5 Rotom 6 Floatzel

Matthew Tardaguila	Just a tip if you plan on using Gyarados I wouldn t want to have a lvl 5 Magikarp a baggage for the first 3 Gyms instead I would wait until Hearthome City to get a lvl 15 Magikarp so that it could atleast get Tackle with the Good Rod found in the next route This would make getting it to a Gyarados easier having it fight in double battle and giving it an Exp Share from Eterna City And like the amount of trainer to fight around Hearthome along with the Vs Seeker would give it more than enough exp to evolve and learn Bite for Fantina s gym I m a Sinnoh fanatic so I hope this help
Alfonso Payan	Fuck take down get RETURN 100 power
Nick Vallie	3 39 you have the wrong team up
Gaming with Golems	Staraptor brave bird takedown roost and steel wing toxic I find it good
HezBolt Productions	My team wa torterra staraptor gallade floatzel houndoom and luxray in platinum
Matthew Hecht	Before my game crashed I also had Gyrados and Staraptor
LFuture	Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash Torterra is trash
Steven Chen	Please make an Empoleon Edition Since you already did it for Infernape If you didn t know Infernape and all beat the game easily No others included
Aries Hindman	my hall of fame team fir platinum is Torterra Giratina Lucario Dusclops Golduck and Togetic
hbarudi	Suggestions 1 on torterra choose 1 of crunch or rock slide and for the last attack choose worry seed If they have levitate use worry seed then earthquake them on the next turn 2 on staraptor you can use giga impact buyable tm instead of take down and avoid recoil and keep fly a the sole flying type damaging attack and use the next slot for defog hm Close combat is a useful attack on this pokemon but having gallade on your team can also let you consider another attack in this slot such a quick attack always attack first aerial ace never miss or agility get more speed Steel wing if you are ok with using single use tm on your pokemon 3 Why leaf blade and earthquake on gallade since you have such type coverage on your starter you can use x scissor for coverage on gallade which is a tm you can reobtain later in battle point For the 4th attack you can use slash night slash even false swipe to be able to catch pokemon and possibly hypnosis also for sleeping them and catching pokemon but doe not work if you used worry seed by your starter 4 Houndoom why physical attack on him when the special attack is better than attack instead do flamethrower dark pulse nasty plot and sludge bomb or shadow ball 5 Lickylicky or possibly just use Bibarel and give it the remaining hm you need 6 For a water type I don t like what magikarp evolves into Pick another water type such a floatzel Can teach it a water hm if you can t fit all your hm on the other pokemon such a bibarel You can use waterfall on floatzel while bibarel can get surf floatzel can learn ice fang and crunch and you can give it the non buyable tm iron tail After some analysis it ha come to be known that 2 type can hit the entire national dex including modern generation of pokemon either neutral damage or super effective Those type are ghost and fighting the same type a marshadow this also applies to earlier generation since the 7th generation is the most type diverse generation and this condition still applies But not for inversion battle in the newer game
Deth Troy	my problem with torterra is not it s speed but lack of grass option to back up it s great attack stat it s special attack is a joke at 75 and there are only four grass move to use with it s physical attack even to this day in gen 7 and only one of those move is gotten via level up Razor Leaf the other move are Wood Hammer which requires a Heart Scale Seed Bomb Move Tutor and Bullet Seed which is only available in the gen 4 game a a TM but why would you even bother with the last one another problem is Platinum compared to D P definitely make thing harder for this thing since two gym leader Crasher Wake and Volkner have counter measure on their platinum team to deal with it when it should have an easy time taking on both
Daniel Kean	Licki licki I m fine with it but clefable is better
Koensko	Turtwig and torterra are my favourite starter so stfu😂
Chuck Pierce	I didn ’ t realize I wa in such a minority but Torterra is my favorite Sinnoh starter lol
Spedghetti Star	Speed speed speed You know speed is NOT the most important stat It doesn t define whether something is good or not Ex Magearna
Johan Buis	Why would you use Iron Tail on Togekiss Fairy type isn t a thing yet in gen IV
cool 23819	I actually like Torterra I like it design Also SPEED BOOSTING MOVES AND X SPEED PEOPLE
Nathan Garcia	What about togepi it can be a flyer
Tom The Boulder	Torterra is such a Cool Pokemon in both concept and Design But Opinions are Opinions so can t get to disappointed
GreenE4	If I were to create a team with Torterra this would be it 1 Torterra 2 Staraptor 3 Electivire 4 Lucario 5 Milotic 6 Scizor
Awakeandalive1	I am completely indifferent to the Piplup line I started out a hardcore Chimchar partisan but then a Nuzlocke in which I let my ID determine my starter got me to use Turtwig and gosh dang it if I don t love the little guy for all his eventual weakness
League of Anime	ty umbreon
89StevieC	3 best team for sinnoh and no Luxray I m a little disappointed really like that mon
Tejendra Chettri	Lol the way you say lickylicky is oddly satisfying and weird😂
BennyBoy46	Surfing the water of Sinnoh on the back of a Lickilicky Majestic
DrMobianDoom	Don t worry Umbreon Torterra is my least favorite starter too
Richard Lavariere	Leech Seed and Wood Hammer
Jacob Lacey	FINALLY SOMEONE THAT LIKES LICKYLICKY
Castrel Troy Madria	Where the other HM s that they can learn how do we complete the game then
SpaceJam45	Land Turtle sir did you mean a TORTOISE
Y 7654321	9 55 kill me
Pedro Reis	Remake of the Infernape video baseade on Platinum would be terrific
Goompro Gameplay	I legit just started a new game of Diamond today and chose Turtwig The coincidence lol
Kaimana Lawrence	Way to keep cool mystic and thanks for not burning or icing Torterra to hard see what did there
Blong Blong Boi	I don ’ t agree with your opinion commit neck rope
Axel Kusanagi	Why doe every starter need to be a sweeper Sometimes you need a wall tank
Brandon Roberts	love these
Jeffrey McMullens	you should teach lickilicky explosion that you can get in the veilstone city game corner you need to get to 10 bonus round in the clafairy game but if you can get it than use it on any pokemon and it will most likely go down it is just a good move to use if you are stuck on any part of the game and if you do not want to go thought the trouble than I still recommend it for other move in the game corner like ice beam and thunderbolt Also i recommend not wasting your money on coin because in my opinion sinnoh ha the easiest game to get money
Infint	Aye Mystic added Lickilicky I don t understand why people hate it it s one of my favourite normal type mon
EM11212	I m playing Platinum for the first time right now My team is Torterra Staraptor Bibarel Luxray Houndoom Bronzong Heatproof
Natalia Loureiro	Tortaras speed doesn t matter because defence are good 😊
blooddemon661	Do serperior next
Ur Boi	That ’ s a good team but I ’ d still make change I ’ d rather teach Gallade Sword Dance over Eq Why teach Gallade Eq when it ha Close Combat and Psycho Cut That coverage hit the exact same type except electric It would be better to teach Eq to Gyarados so that it can beat the electric type that threaten it Sword Dance in Gallade make it insanely strong In place of Take Down I ’ d give Staraptor Return It ’ s better in every way The only downside to it is that it depends on happiness friendship so I ’ d wait before actually using the tm I think you can check if happiness is maxed out by talking to the person in the house on the beach before Pastoria City If it ’ s maxed then you will get a ribbon Not sure why you would even consider using Lickylicky If you need a Surf user I recommend Vaporeon or Gastrodon Then can also learn Ice Beam They are both good since they are insanely bulky Gastrodon might be the better choice because it ha a better typing a it is part ground so it immune to electric Plus it get Recover at level 54 To be honest I ’ ve used Houndoom before in Platinum and I think that it ’ s pretty useless Sure it beat Byron Candice and Aaron but so doe Torterra Staraptor and Gallade The only reason you ’ re using it is for Lucian and in my experience Houndoom doe badly against him I find that it ’ s too slow and get OHKOed by Focus Blast which every member of his team ha And even if he miss and you land a Dark Pulse the damage isn ’ t that great and by the end of the turn you will be hoping that he miss the next Focus Blast To replace it I would use Drapion To be honest I ’ ve never actually used one in Platinum but I think that it would do better because it ’ s better for beating Lucian which is Houndoom ’ s only job It ha a better typing which leaf it with one weakness It get Crunch at level 49 and Toxic Spikes at level 28 But I don ’ t know how easy Skorupis are to find So if it were up to me the team would be Torterra Earthquake Woodhammer Crunch Curse Rock Slide Stone Edge Curse Staraptor Brave Bird Fly Close Combat Return Quick Attack Gyarados Dragon Dance Waterfall Ice Fang Earthquake Gallade Sword Dance Psycho Cut Close Combat Leaf Blade Gastrodon Surf Ice Beam Recover Toxic Drapion Toxic Spikes Crunch and any 2 coverage move of your choice Bibarel Keep him a a Hm slave and swap him with Drapion when needed
Benjix Bishop	One word PORYGON Z Guys he is unbeatable with hyper beam

Moises Gonzalez	My pokemon team for Torterra is Torterra Staraptor Magnezone Floatzel Frosslass Garchamp
Your Lord and Savior	Torterra is pure garbage It ’ s grass typing is useless since if you go against a water type it ’ ll obliterate you with an ice move It ’ s use is literally only for facing rock ground type and for that purpose you ’ re better off going with a water type
Tommy Marino	This will be my team Torterra Mothim Glaceon Gastrodon Lopunny Togekiss
BlackStar	Instant like becuase it a team with torterra Oh nvm u dont like him c haha
char sage	I find it rather funny how he call Torterra bad do to it s low stat speed there s pokemon in OU slower then Torterra or close to Torterra in speed
TheJH1015	I m SRing for a shiny Turtwig in platinum and I m planning on the following team what do you think Torterra Whiscash Vespiquen Drapion Houndoom Bronzong
Muhamad Karimo	Do a infernape
Neutral	I literally use Torterra every Sinnoh game he s my favourite of the Sinnoh starter
ShadowSamuel	I hope houndour will be available in gen 4 remake In Platinum I picked Chimchar but in remake I plan to pick Turtwick

James Maxx	My Platinum Team Torterra Wood Hammer Earthquake Stone Edge Crunch Houndoom Flamethrower Dark Pulse Nasty Plot SolarBeam Floatzel Surf Ice Beam Crunch Brick Break Staraptor Fly Return Close Combat U turn Lucario Aura Sphere Dragon Pulse Shadow Ball Psychic Weavile Ice Punch Night Slash Brick Break Swords Dance

georgegeorgex	You almost made Torterra s half screen time spent being crossed out by a big red X You don t like it we get it but It s a funny subtle message so gj
Smack Jack	I ’ m happy you ’ ve shown Lickilicky some love by putting it on a team Slurpee my nickname for it is an amazing Pokémon
Trey Morrison	Torterra Staraptor Gallade and Houndoom are excellent choice Personally I would be using Vaporeon instead of Gyarados Also I would add either Froslass or Weavile Ice is so underrated
The_Great_Rasputin	To be honest Medicham is decent replacement for Gallade in Diamond and Pearl It doesn t get a good physical Psychic STAB but it s still pretty powerful with move like Force Palm Drain Punch Rock Slide and Psychic is a decent move on it
John Lizzio	Again why is there no garchomp
shadowedpast	Why leaf blade on Gallade As opposed to coverage like night slash or pne of the elemental punch
Juan Sebastian Florez Buitrago	Why do you put in narrys team the team he will have if you chosse empoleon with torterra
Dragonmist19X	The Houndour family is one most underappreciated in the franchise Yeah cause so many family got megas
Jace Beckner	Why do you hate Torterra
Gerjan De Zeeuw	I don t get how anyone can hate torterra it is literaly a moving f cking mountain ready to stomp your as
Dragon Quest	My torterra team Torterra Luxray Staraptor Machamp Vaporeon Drapion
Deadend36	Feels awful man My favourite pokemon is Torterra
pwrsurg35	I personally like torterra Its my favorite grass starter because of it typing I usually dont like grass starter It really doe get very good moveset variety which is cool Its main downside is the speed but it doesnt bother me because I can put other pkmn on the team to cover that need
Science Is Ma Thing	Why do you hate torterra
BradPlaysGames	LICK ee LICK ee the way you say lickilicky s name make me really uncomfortable I can hear the spit in your mouth so stop it

TheMojoLemon	Torterrrrrrra
maguire bentz	I ’ d never ever user a licklicky
Emilio Camacho Erice	The biggest problem is his special defense or lack of it to be honest for something that is slow just like with emboar
Joey Grant	It s very easy to get Torterra by the time you fight Maylene and it absolutely destroys her Meditite and Lucario with Bite and EQ respectively
TheMightyBlaze	What if speed effected accuracy
Aqua	This video is all I ever wanted
Dragon Zek	Why tortera it trash do wish it never excited

heated typhlosion	Typhlosion squad where you at
Everton Batista	I play Platinum right now so many pokémon for team
NeomG	Land turtle you mean a tortoise
Amanda Watkins	I hate you Tortara is great
Benny	If you ’ re up for it you could remove Gallade and use Toxicroak As for a replacement that ’ s up to you but I think it ’ d be a pretty alright Pokemon For a move set I recommend Sludge Bomb Close Combat Cross Chop X Scissor Knock Off
Mr. 1up	Wow he really like advertising them T shirt lol
Alexander Evans	I respect your opinion but I like turtwig and torterra
Audangas Kozmianas	Torterra is one of my favorite starter how dare you say it s your least liked starter now I m not gon na like your video
Brawlerman 10	I played platinum last summer with this team Torterra Infernape Traded over sorry Gastrodon Drifblim Lucario Weavile
Thirdy Guy Productions	YES Finally Hi there nice vid it s 3 04 AM here because I woke up at 1 53 AM And it s October 22 2018
gagers78	Personally I find houndoom hard to use in a playthrough due to it getting flamethrower late game and so it ha to use fire fang for stab I prefer using rapidash I don t get why people say rapidash is so weak It ha a good stab attack in flame wheel from a low level and it ha a good speed and attack My team would be Torterra Staraptor Drapion Gastrodon Gardevoir Rapidash
Astaku Dreemarc	I m about to play pokemon white 2 I thought of a team Samurott Lopunny Lucario Crobat Arcanine Zoroark Any thought and or suggestion on moveset and or replacement
Dryden Joss	what s wrong with mega houndoom
Akash	Thanks so much mystic
what up	Sup
Nicholas Batawui	Love Fourth gen playing it right now
Mawile #303	I still like my Role Play team of Dawn a name character Empoleon Togekiss Cynthia Egg Lucario Riley Egg Glaceon from the PC runner Bebe a Eevee Garchomp because Pseudo Luxray simply because you need something else at the start
Fear the Pig Gaming	I will never defile a team involving my beloved Torterra with that pink abomination thank you for the suggestion but I will absolutely find a different filler lmao
SurfingKyogre	Torterra is underrated tbh
Animelover445 Serrato	Your brave to do this
XannyFanta	Don t like how you re dissing torterra
Virasman	I used Infernape Flamethrower Close combat thunderpunch earthquake Togekiss Aura sphere air slash fly extreme speed Luxray Discharge thunder fang crunch iron tail Vaporeon Surf ice beam acid armor hydro pump Gengar Thunderbolt Shadow ball psychic sludge bomb Abomasnow Wood hammer ice shard avalanche brick break
SteelTypeNULL	Man I love Houndoom i didn t used Infernape in my first Platinum walkthrough just for make a slot for this hell hound
Shiny Arceus	Awesome video
Kudo 108	I think lickylicky is cute 3
Max Oakley	I feel sorry for mystic for making a team for a slowass torterra
Bryson Beran	Your a poopy head
Devon RoseRed	What are some Pokemon I could use instead of the Platinum exclusive I don t have Platinum
D B	Piplup is the worst for platinum Chimchar is the best Turtwig is the middle I prefer medicham over gallade
Don Slaughter420	I love Gen 4
Galaxy-Eyes Garchomp	I knew this wa s co op between you and 4thgengamer
JStan96	Wouldn t Return be a better option on Staraptor than Take Down It s more powerful ha better accuracy and doesn t do any recoil damage Plus there s more than 1 Return TM in Platinum so you can teach it to Lickylicky a well
The Solao	Take down is useless on staraptor U Turn is wayyyy better
Patrick Kennedy	This is a very well balanced team I like it
Kevin Murphy	I like Torterra
Mal muffin	What about porygon
SAA AZI	I felt like Luxray or Electivire would be better in the place of lickylicky Specialy Electivire
Joshua Shark	Infernape is my favorite Sinnoh starter
Michael Anzulavich	I feel like Floatzel or Milotic is a better option of a Gyarados
Tasty Treats	00 10 2spoopy5me
David Larkin	My prediction Torterra Staraptor Houndoom Gyarados Jynx Lucario Edit 1 Return is also a very viable option for Staraptor nearly a powerful a Take Down but without the huge recoil Edit 2 Thank you for showing Lickylicky some love Edit 3 4 out of 6 right not bad
Catherine Whittaker	Why Take Down on Staraptor Return outclasses it higher power at max friendship no recoil better accuracy and you re given 2 Return TMs for free with additional one purchaseable in Veilstone
CormacThunderStar	I d switch Take Down for Return on Staraptor
Sofia	Use a Quick Claw on Torterra it really help
TheGamerBros	Hi
super gespierde femke!!	Hi mystic my team fore tortarra is torterra starrapter vlochle gelaite hhundoom and glgliseon
Jayden Ross	Turtwig is my favorite starter
Bear 0601	My first team in Platinum Torterra Garchomp Gardevoir Magmortar Scizor Machamp If you want to you can rate this team but looking back at it I think maybe Golduck or Floatzel could have been better than Gardevoir
Can we get 500 subs With bad content ?	7 50 Lol I thought 99 you guy would pick Floatzel Because he make up for torterras speed Otherwise for me personally it design over viability So Gastrodon it is Its slow but ha the Hp it also ha Ground so It wa my strategy against Bertha because Hippowdowns Sp Def is it weak spot Torterra being a physical attacker Gastrodon led the way With Ground it also doesnt have any effect with sandstorm Overall Gastrodon is good but I can see why gyarados is here Heck 5 6 of my Pearl team are from sinnoh With the exception of course being Rapidash but even in Platinum Houndoom Camerupt Torkoal and Magcargo aren t native to Sinnoh either
Javier Ramos	Allright time for me to go home to unnova cu that s what is next
G.M Twins	Love you and your vids
typhlosion 787	use return instead of take down on staraptor you can get it at the game corner
Spartan Sid	Man I have to be honest with y ’ all I FUCKING HATE EMPOLEON IT IS IN FACT THE WORST SINNOH STARTER AND THE SECOND TO WORST WATER STARTER OUT OF ALL THE WATER STARTERS NEXT TO SAMUROTT OF COURSE I mean sure it ’ s dual typing of Water Steel is amazing and all but that ’ s a far a it can get Reasons 1 It ’ s HP Attack and Defense stats all suck due to it ranging at the 80 and it ’ s speed is at a stupid 60 2 This Ugly penguin is NEITHER a tank NOR a glass cannon Yes it ’ s Special Attack and Special Defense is good however it get OUTCLASSED by Vaporeon with acid armor and Goodra with the ability Gooey and Hydration 3 Also I know it suppose to be based off of Napoleon and an Emperor However I feel a penguin pulling off that look is terrible MAYBE if a MOUNTAIN LION 🦁 were to pull of that look I ’ d consider it okay on my book And I think y ’ all can agree a mountain lion is better than a stupid penguin 4 It doe a SHITTY JOB in the Sinnoh type play through Having to only take down no more than two gym battle 5 Finally when you take a good look at it move set 90 of it is mainly water and normal move having access to only one flying type move and about two steel type move So yeah those are my reason why I FUCKING HATE EMPOLEON Go ahead and trash my response to Empoleon but I ’ m NOT SORRY for saying that empoleonsucksdick

Liam Flanagan	not first
MrKidKeeb	Can you do Decidueye for Ultra sun and Ultra moon
_Dak_	TAKE DOWN on staraptor why not return it s much better in power and accuracy doesn t have recoil and you can get it at the beginning of the game too also Gyarados doesn t get crunch in platinum didn t learn crunch until ORAS stupid i know
joinmarch76	Eh I stand by what I said some time ago Torterra speed is SUPPOSED to be slow And given how it hold an entire mountain on it back I don t blame it for being sluggish
Tuxedo Banana	Man already under 60 comment
Koala Fontnite	It s not that bad a a pokemon
