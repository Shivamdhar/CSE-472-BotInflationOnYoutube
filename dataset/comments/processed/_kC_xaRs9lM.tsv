Jake McGuire	It's funny how everyone keeps mentioning While she sleeps new single, "Anti Social."  I don't think the two could even be compared.  Anti social seems so mediocre and lacking in musical complexity to me..  I don't even find any section of it catchy at all.....  Just goes to show how subjective music is.  Gotta appreciate it all though.  Because there's no such thing as good or bad music.. It's all in the ear of the beholder.
103peanut	Pre-ordered this album just now! A copy for me and a copy for my girlfriend who also enjoys this type of music :D

Beast Incarnate23	Architects get better with every song and listen. I fucking love them ü§òüèª
John Mooradian	Holy Damn!!!! I'm a 47 year old, old school metalhead, and I've been listening to a lot of Parkway Drive and Architects lately, and I'm officially addicted. Our local rock station in Atlanta, plays the same shit over and over and never anything new. Glad I checked out these awesome bands.
Malcolm mloclaM	I have to admit, when I first heard this, I thought it was the weaker song of the 3 singles released before the album. But since listening to them several times since.... this is hands down the strongest one. I mean they're all excellent, don't get me wrong. But the melody, the intensity, the lyrics....
just one more retarded	Tem Br que curte architects?
Jackson Plays	Why is this group so good to me
Krombopulos Micheal	Wow, 326 people accidentally disliked this.   ...someone should let then know so they can fix it.

I Drink Milk	Another fucking banger by these cunts. At this point they're effortless. In that I mean, every track is a fucking masterpiece in its own way. While I don't quite think this is as good as royal beggars, I fucking love it. I love all that they do.   10/10. Again. Again and again and again. Shit. Aoty

Bloody Killer	Guys,you are FUCKING AWESOME!!!!üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
StickToYourGonz	I was a little scared about what would happen to the band after Tom's passing 'cause he was the principal composer and lyricist in the band, but they are keeping that good level from the last two albums and Josh Middleton was the best option to follow Tom's legacy... Tom would be proud of them, they're such an amazing band. Forever Tom, forever Architects.
Lorena Fraz√£o	Always producing the best lyrics. One of my favorite bands.
Jesus Mary	You have exactly 4:12 to live choose wisely
wenderson braz	que som do caramba vei
Justin Bayles	A little disappointed on the breakdowns, they were kind of anticlimactic
Jim Bob	Fucking stop comparing music.. I swear no one appreciates music anymore. You all just pick everything in songs. Every artist I listen to now on YouTube, I read through the comments and everyone expects so much from artists these days. It‚Äôs ridiculous! Just learn to appreciate music, at the end of the day the artist has still put time into making these songs. Pick up some instruments and try to make your own songs and then you will understand the art in it.
Motionless Min	This album is going to be the highlight of this year.
Preston Loeb	Would've sounded dope if the instrumentals cut off at 0:32 for like 2 seconds and came back in. Anyone else??
Federico Kasjan	No hace falta cambiar para innovar , uno puede innovar aunque haga el mismo genero hace 10 a√±os , se nota cuanto les gusta lo que hacen , ojala nunca vendan su culo como bmth
LAST CLASHER	Architects made me a stronger person today ! I will love this band till end.

ApachE	How does it keep getting better? How?
John Deare	An unhealthy amount of the views are from me
Lilitu	I remember seeing them at a show and a tiny scene kid stomping a big ass dudes leg straight back(through skin, if I remember correctly)at the kneecap. Dude went down, shit was wild. Anyway, I wish more bands created that energy haha
They call Me RAIN	I'm grateful
Jk Rj	His cleans are amazing...     And, why no "blegh"? :(
Jared Gailey	I can't turn my speakers up loud enough.

J. Osvaldo Hurtado	Fav band. It's amazing that they keep getting better and better. Love you guys, your music is one of the best things i've ever heard. Thank you.
Patrick Damacet	my neighbour called cops  cuz I was playing Architects loud. the cops arrested him
iwasgarrett	No blehs? ):
The Knight Patriot	The white cube reminds me of Evile's "Infected Nations." Totally different subgenres, and the songs aren't remotely similar, but visually that's what this video looks like. I wonder if they're fans.
9rmetal	This song is so Daybreaker!
Federico Fernandez	Se nota mucho la influencia de Josh Middleton, y no veo que lo haya resaltado nadie!
Josh Shylan	Man this new album is going to be massive. These guys are at the peak of their game. Epic tune....
I AM THE PILOT	Chug chug chug weee weeee chug chug
Marc Ferreras	Architects, you're not human to create such masterpieces, that's not possible üò≠
Kyle Kruse	I've have recently discovered this band and I'm a lil obsessed. I just love the raw emotion you can hear in Sam's voice along with the badass music being played. This is now one of my favorite bands of all time.

Ryan Mclin	To be one of the people who have grown up with them since the album ruin, it‚Äôs just awesome to get the goosebumps every time a new album comes out. TOM it‚Äôs been a great ride thank you so much for all you‚Äôve done to move my heart. I love seeing the band progress every album. Keep it guys. R.I.P Tom Searle! </3
lacerta aeneus	Let's face it, ladies and gentlemen: we will love almost everything these guys are going to release :) For some reason, I feel myself on the similar mental waves with them, I'm sure they are uncapable to write the song that I won't like, it's as obvious as tomorrow's sunrise.
Voice Of Ruin	I can already say that the new record will burn everything!

Foch Bailey	Architects have always always ALWays held it down. Keep this shit up guys. Tom is proud!
LazySillyDonkey	Unpopular opinion: I think Josh's skills are wasted in this band. Band with his friends, and putting money in the bank aside. Listen to Sylosis and then come back to this. This is coming from a fan of both bands.
InterJani95	3:36 Holy shit how beutiful is that

VaultMoses85	This album will be f*cking epic
Mois√©s Odor√≠ssio	This song is all about what happened in Brazil. As a Brazilian, I mean, our country has reached its worst political moment.  I know Sam knows what's going on.  We have just elected a fascist president who hides behind a religious mask.  This man propagates hatred, death, torture. He is homophobic, xenophobic, racist.  I have many friends and acquaintances who are afraid, who walk in fear on the streets. The voters of this president are feeling the right to offend, to hurt, and even to kill.  It is sad to know that many people in this country that I live in have taken off their masks and are revealing their "truths." Because of the horrible speech of this new president, bad people are cropping up their evil deeds to hurt those who just want to live peacefully and just be what they are.  World, if you are following or reading what I say, know that here the gays, the women, the foreigners, the blacks, and all those who represent the minorities, are suffering and are afraid of dying.  All of us human beings are equal, we all have the same rights and we should be just what we are without fear.  Architects is an incredible band and helps many people here lose their blindness. This band helps us to see that we need the union of the weak and above all: to live, to spread and to believe in love.  Thank you Architects, for every song important to our humanity.
Champayne Records	Being a fan now for 11 years and they just can't write a bad song... it's incredible.

Tremonti 34	Their sound and words are really touching to the hearts. Rip Tom‚úäüôè
Swampdonkey69 YT	In the Bible it says that the world will be overrun by evil, even in the Church. False believers

Haziq Jack	3:33 the moment of smooth headbang and teary eyes
Mili	What a masterpiece! The video's message is so powerful it gave me goosebumps. The lack of empathy shown made me sick. Hats off to Architects. It is a beautiful value to teach that we must respect human dignity above all.
Rocky	NEVER DISSAPOINTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Wrathchild1995	This sounds fucking epic! :D Seriously cannot wait to hear the full album, every song released so far is solid ;)
Jimmy Schwietert	I am a huge fan of Josh Middleton. I keep coming back to Architects and keep leaving with the same impression, disappointment. I am thinking it is the screaming rather than clean. Josh's vocals he did with Sylosis had a deep growl and it worked. The music is decent but not outstanding. Vocals are rough. I might give it one more try but it would be tough.
Matthew Willis	Can‚Äôt wait for this damn album...
Wildfire788	Uh, hey... There's an arrow in your, yeah, in your chest. You might wanna get that checked out?

Justin van Zuilekom	Personally I don't really like it. It's not as catchy as I'm used to, and it's sounds pretty light to me. But I'm just a Pedobear wandering the comments.
Danijel Markov	This sounds like Hard Core :'D
Mathew Georgetti	Holy....fuck..
–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º –ñ–∏–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤	I've been listening Architects since I was 15. Now I'm 21. I relistened all their albums many times and tried to find inspiration and power in all of their tracks.  I don't want to accuse anybody but this is step down. The melody, the lyrics, the emotional message are so weak that it is more a pop song than Architects are usually suppposed to be.  Everything's is changing. As for me, that's the end of the epoch.

C Hutch109	First few listens I thought this was decent, now I think it's special as fuck, especially 3:36 onwards, beautiful
M. D.	Pretty good as always, but I feel like they keep that song structure and use it again and again... Don't get me wrong, I love that band, but it'd be even better if they tried to renew a bit (imo).

Jordan Payne	Whats weird to me is that they havent stopped being emo. I mean, I know why but it must be hard to takeyourselves seriously when youre being that dramatic. Kudos to them
Bruceski	I instantly clicked this video because he looked like Zefrank1 in the throws of passion in the thumbnail. Not disappointed
Arkansas Backyardsmen	Fuck! This sounds like a song that would be on daybreaker or lost forever lost together even. So fucking sick!
iAndroid	forgot i was subbed to epitaph
Mohamad Roslaily	This is impossible to sing. üò≠üò≠
Dorian Arcia	So...I just want to let you all know that this album is going to sweep modern metalcore off it's feet, okay? Like it'll just blow everything out of the water, alright? Just letting y'all know. Holy HELL this is gonna be great.
ItsAvalxnche	A perfect mix between AOGHAU and LT//LF in terms of production and songwriting.  I can't wait for this album already
Aleksandr Sidachev	As always, It's a gorgeous work.
Konstantin Staroverov	My opinion is somewhat unpopular here, but I don‚Äôt really like any of the new songs. They all sound boring and bland. I do love every album from hollow crown to AOGHAU though.
Artur Shapel	–°–∞–º–∞—è –ª—É—á—à–∞—è —Ä–æ–∫ –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞,  –∫–∞–∂–¥–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è –Ω–µ—Å—ë—Ç –≤ —Å–µ–±–µ –≥–ª—É–±–æ–∫–∏–π —Å–º—ã—Å–ª!!!
Charlie Jorgensen	Tom lives on.... Much more his sound in this song.... It's beautiful.... architects make you feel emotion better then anyone else in my opinion
Dylan Hardy	Think it should be "all the devils are here, singing us their lords prayer" seems more fitting for this shit tip world being torn apart be religion
Qi Ub	Give it to me !! Give me this album #.#
Michele La Spina	0:22 Finally we get the chance to hear the bass !
Nicola m	1:45 is ridiculous.
Norman Rocher	AWESOME. want dat BLEH at 3:19pls üòéü§ò
Sammy_Irish	Soooo moist right now
Jason Barry	I don't expect it, especially since you guys have done more than most, but a video for every song on this album would be next level if that's the trend you're going for.
RextheRebel	So glad I heard Doomsday so I could find so much more by these guys. Great stuff.
chace lee	*B* *L* *E* *G* *H*
Alex's World	Parkway drive: we're the best hard band on the scene! Architects: hold our bleghs.... This is gonna take a while...
Daniel Meza	Fuck I got into these guys so late!!! I missed out on so many great tunes!!! Better late than never ü§òüèºü§òüèºü§òüèº

Pz Blue	the boys are mental
Steph Ashton Van Niekerk	I love how they've stayed architects throughout all these years.
darwin kartiko	fuct voice
John Reznik	Anyone know what song it  sounds like from 1:17 to 1:21 when he says this is a prison for lost souls
Travis Lee	This band is trash.  I just cant ever get into this gay shit. Sorry
Simpatico	I love this track. Royal Beggars is still my favorite, but this is probably my second favorite. I'm exempting Doomsday, but that would be my favorite. I love Hereafter, but not as much as everyone else.
iKrebbs	They aren‚Äôt fucking around with this album. Beautiful üëåüèª
Rangerafi	This is more than likely going to be my favorite album from them. I feel like they put so much more heart into this one. I‚Äôve loved the past 3 albums but this one is on track to be my favorite. Every single song so far has been on repeat because they can‚Äôt put out a bad song.   I don‚Äôt doubt this album is more or less a dedication to Tom.
Stephanie Templar	‚ÄúJust a parasite killing its hosts‚Äù is a perfect depiction of the human race. We are leeching off the dwindling resources produced by the earth in which we inhabit, slowly killing it with our greed and insatiable desire for more.
maikonny manquecoy	Hare un rewiew
Eradicism	Honestly, i came to this.
Tony Barber	fucking modern day soilwork baby fuck yea!!

Julian Barriga	Jesus Christ I need to punch something
McDowell Fool Reselling	The amount of people quitting their job over this song.

Joseph Versleys	The chorus reminds me of the one in All Love Is Lost, it could be intentional, good song though.
SamWilliams_Music	Sounds a lot like madonna
Marco Matienzo	This song hit me hard. Being burned out of my passion from repeatative way of living and sitting in an office everyday. Thank you Architects for reminding me what I was and the things COULD still reach.

Pskylark	Holy Hell his voice is pure power.
Marco Celotti	Great lyrics
TheCpten	This song revokes so many feelings in me. Been having it on repeat all day, probably my favorite song throughout the whole year. Thank you Architects for yet another masterpiece. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Teresa Danhauer	I love how the video for Royal Beggars and this video just work out together. Both songs are incredible and I can't wait to hear and see them live.
kittyp330	just wow ‚ù§ there is so much going on musically and the vocal layering! I can not wait for the rest of holy hell.  everything is so emotional charged and the lyrics are amazing.  I can't stop listening to this.
Ryan VanDerSchaegen	Wow..... lyrics are unbelievable
Jerad Scharrer	Album of the year?  New Architects?  New While She Sleeps?  New Ice Nine Kills?  New Silent Planet?  I can't handle the amount of perfection hitting at every angle right now.  Pretty sure Architects is going to take it for me.  Ive been having INK on repeat, such a solid perfect album front to back, and they will be followed by 3 more solid albums.  What a year....
Rise Of The Idiots	Respect for staying heavy when most other bands go soft.
Todd Romine	November is going to be a damn good month for metal. It starts with new albums from the ocean and silent planet followed by architects.  Then new unearth I'm so excited!
Corey	Thank you guys for not selling out and going soft to hit a wider audience. I love that you have stayed true to your style since day 1, regardless of whats happened on your path as a band. You guys fucking kill!

Ice phoenix	I *SO* can't wait for this album, holy fuck.
martin sedy	3:36 Everytime when I hears this, I just imagine myslef flying through outer space ... absolutely beautiful
Lucifer Vane	Can‚Äôt wait to hear the final trackü§ò
Brian Williams	I don't want this to come across the wrong way, but I'm REALLY glad all the songs aren't just about the loss of Tom. When they said on their mini documentary that this was an album about coping with loss I was concerned they might all be different versions of Doomsday, but these singles are straight fire and this band deserves credit for being emotional, strong, and fantastic song writers.
Algernon Blacker	This band is fricking amazing, I love what they stand for and they are coping so well with what happened Tom, guys never stop making music ü§ò
Dan Vernon	I'm not quite sure, feel like I'm guessing way more than with "Royal Beggars" but I think I got my very own interpretation of what this track is about.  Throughout the video we have this glass-cube in which they all perform but Sam, who at some point towards the end has managed to break out of it - I believe this cube to symbolise a cage, putting your mistakes on display for everyone, being transparent to others, a 'messiah not wearing any clothes' (Reference to lines 3-4). The fact that Josh, Ali and Adam have in some way a connection to the computer or smartphone in the video and are not being shown to live outside of the that cube, somehow leads me to the thought, that this cage of glass is supposed to reflect our identity online. We are transparent, we are flawed without showing shame, we are naked in a very abstract way. And most importantly, we are caught in this image of ourselves on the web. "This is a prison for lost souls" Then, there's Dan, who suffocates on the table with Ali facing him and not caring at all. It seems like the mobile in Ali's hands is not only distracting him from the situation, it became more important and hinders him from feeling empathy. He watches Dan die, stands up and takes pictures of the scene, rather than feeling connected to what's happening in any way. The whole verse "We planted a seed..." and so on seems to underline that once more. Josh is starting to bleed from the eyes in a very similar manner he did in "Royal Beggars", where he sat in front of a TV and smoked, Ali is on his phone, not quite yet effected by it. Adam is busy working, handing Josh stuff to do and thereby contributing to Josh's destructive behaviour (I mean, that sentence sounds weird but Josh is literally bleeding so I guess...). Adam too lives in the box but on a passive level, while it's slightly more of an active act for Ali, even more so for Josh who destroys himself.   On the other side we have the very frequently occuring picture of Sam with an arrow in his chest, hit like a hunted animal, like a wolf that has been shot down. 'Running with the wolves' to me stands for a more natural way of living than being caught in this horrific crate of glass and "now we can't see the forest" basically reminds us of how far we have strayed from living freely, how far from being wild and not killing ourselves. He is in his room, not falling for the destructive lifestyle - "I won‚Äôt go to the grave, with the song still in me, and I won‚Äôt live like a slave, begging from my knees". He lives with the pain, because he believes it is what's right and doesn't trust false 'emperors' or saviours.  That's all I got, I'm sorry for it being a bit rough and way to long. And now - please, someone finally explain to me what the sunflower in every room but the cage is supposed to mean...I can't make sense of it. Thank you all for reading and if you stuck with me, I really appreciate it. Of course this is just my take on the song, dunno if it's any better than guessing. Cheers!
SYTHEOPATH 1	I know I'm not the only one who expected a BLEGH! @00:30 ü§£
Jestermac02	Ok now. Some people say, that this song is similar to All love is lost or the chord progression sounds like Memento Mori.  For me, the bachground melody in Modern Misery is clearly different than the one in All Love is lost. And i actually hear no similarities between this and Memento Mori. Maybe my ears are fucked up, but can someone explain to me, where the connection between those songs come from? I mean, they definitely have the Architects sound but for me these are all very different and awesome songs.
Perch	If someone finds my head please send me a message, I lost it during 3:19
Ond≈ôej Bursa	Am I the only one that finds this band not interesting anymore, releasing 3 versions of one song all over again last 3 albums? Not saying it's bad tho, it's just... boring to hear the same thing again and again...

Benjamin Carradice	That Memento Mori chord progression at the end though
PUBG BIZZLE	Do love the band but I‚Äôm just not seeing the variety in sound these days. It‚Äôs like how many times can you churn out the same song? Not hating I‚Äôm a massive fan but for a band that has evolved so much, they are certainly stuck in a rut at the minute just releasing the same song over and over.   bleh 12-0-0-12-0-12-10-0 and repeat for 3 albums.   Again just my opinion, obviously still going to see them when they are in my town just a bit gutted with the latest releases from them.
Andr√© Hosken	MDS, QUE BANDA!!
Sideness	We're gonna fight hard in the pits ;)
Donlyn Staz Kuroneko	Your wife as soon as you open the front door
Sam Jardine	Liking this better than the last two...
Nikoleta Fellner	BEST. BAND. EVER. ‚ù§Ô∏è
juan atmaja	D E E P üî•
Tom√°≈° Kampf	Awesome... 31/1 Prague... I'm waiting 4 U guys üòâ
Callan Paterson	What ? No BLEGH??
Petros Laloukiotis	Can we take a moment and appreciate how violent & intense the way he growled "Are these our new messiahs?" sounded? Like holy hell, where are these vocals coming from.
Memphis 13	Awesome!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
xyLooo	Naysayer V2
Detestor 420	This is a fucking crusher!
Shivs	That little melody in the background during the chorus is so fucking beautiful. Josh, you're a god!
–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ú–∞—Å–ª–æ–≤	To my mind, song is pretty good, but guitar part is too easy for architect's song.
Tommy Raviglione	fucking slaps
Benjamin M√ºllner	When you rent a studio for a week and have to record a music video every single day.
Nazrin Brubaker	This and Royal Beggars are totally awesome, but I hope theres more songs like Hereafter in the album. I hope they dont turn into a full on EMO Metalcore band.
Bushcraft Buddha	We used to run with the wolves meaning we were in a perfect symbiosis with nature and our surroundings. Now we re running behind technology which has become our new god. Technology measures and quantifies us, so we become predictable and replaceable...  But you can'tcompute, measure or quantify what comes from the heart... welcome to the times of modern misery
g h o s t k i d s	It it just me or do some parts sound like AMMIH, specifically the 'all the anchors in the ocean...' part? Either way its such a good song üëäüëå
Siturba	Prepare y√ºr an√ºs f√ºr new alb√ºm
Virtual PradaZ	Architects AND While She Sleeps new songs on the same day? Today is a good day.
Olivier Seyler	I'm just banging my head as hard as I can. Well done guys. Well done. ü§òüèªüëåüèª
Joel Puente	Deje de escuchar Metalcore desde Sempiternal (BMTH), porque la escena cada vez se esta volviendo un poco gay. Pero este album de Architecs va muy bien y los temas uno mejor que el otro, son el mejor exponente al dia de hoy
David van Vuuren	Brilliant!
ŒàŒΩŒ∑ Œ¶ŒªŒøœç	‚ù§
Austin Kuhlenschmidt	I can only imagine the hate for this, but... As much as I like architects, this is lacking, like the other songs released already. They‚Äôre still better than 95% of artists out there, but without Tom they simply aren‚Äôt impressive as before. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs just something missing to it and unfortunately I don‚Äôt think AOGHAU  will be topped.
Mike Hunt	Tom would be so proud of you guys like,honestly you really are keeping his legacy alive <3
Cole13517	Bleghtastic 10/10
Terry Bowman	i swear that i extremely love Architects to the core, Architects is fucking pure art

OuttraZd	Heavycore
Samy	My body is ready
HCROCK	Seven billion hungry ghosts
Ramadhan Sudaryanto	This is insaneüî•
Johannes Sch	It's crazy since Lost Together they never changed their sound but at the same time they're constantly getting better.
linchpyn	Hearing a new Architects song is like when you get together with a good old friend after a long time. The first 15-30 mins are rare, but then you get realized everything is as cool as always.
Sinan Uluc	I can listen to this all day.
Aldi Satriahidayat	3:20 these colors dont run vibe
L√©na Oliveros	Holy hell ! All our gods have NOT abandoned us, because A R C H I T E C T S still here ‚Ä¶ Awesome ! üñ§

syanachannn 95	I don't like hard music... I want Architect keep make song like "royal beggars" one
Jo√£o Vitor Mesquita	This music fits right into the reality of Brazil, I feel thrilled listening to this song.
tak jest	Incredible... Those sounds from momento mori corissing over...
DaveyCrockett5000	I wasn't ready for that. Love it.
Kabz	fuck i don't remember the last time i was this keen for an album to drop
Anibal Zuniga	Gees this band is coming out hard and im loving it cannot wait for the album to come out..
Jamie Lawrence	This is...ok? Reminds me a bit of Daybreaker, but also feels like a bit of a 'standard Architects' song structure. I think Hereafter is a much better track, this might work really well sandwiched in the middle of an album though.
Johnny Rakete	#Holyhell, was ein Brettüî•üñ§
Iron Moon	This will most likely be the metalcore album of the year.
NinjaCloud	Sam is a beast vocalist, he can scream like that with an arrow in his heart? Goddamn...
Bartosz M	First Architects, then WSS <3
JimboShreds	Anyone notice the Momento Mori vibe at the end though? Goosebumps
Soyer	So heavy and angry! Love it very much
Mandi Hernandez	I‚Äôm so in love with them!! Now and then there amazing beautiful üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§
tofol cano	Damn why is Gus Johnson so angry
Amy	I haven't been this hyped for an album in years.
Cj Cribbs	Holy Hell, each new release is just better than the previous this is easy choice for album of the year.
sirtagada	I think a few people just misclicked on the thumbs down button instead of thumbs up !
TheTallTom	I am in love with everything this band has ever done.
Cameron Little	I think if I was a caveman I would have run the fuck away from the wolves, but this song may have helped me get along with them. p.s. Ali taking a picture of Dan passed out in a pool of blood was fucking hilarious.
Giorgos Abso	I expected a nice ol' BLEGH after the second 'Modern Misery'.      10/10 still
Siddhartha who?	Hell is empty , all the devils are here singing us the lord‚Äôs prayer ! Damn true Vatican City *cough cough*
Jonathan Jimenez	Nice
Remember Me	JARED?
Jason Bentley	I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the chest.

√Åd√°m V√∂lgyesi	Hey, look, a new Architects song without a blegh!
Hitwood Melodic Death Metal 2018	1.46 the magic happens. But I was wondering why there are no BLEAGH's at 3.19?? It would have been perfect.......btw New Architects and new While She Sleeps in the same day! With this constance they release all the album songs before the release day of the album will come :)
Mr VossoRox	No bleagh no party
dante	WE USED TO RUN WITH THE WOLVES
Acoustic Showcase	I may be wrong but I think we have a BLEAGH Guinness Record Here 00:33 .... LOL

Tyrone Loney-Wright	Awesome üëåü§ò
Yudho Stwn	Nice halloween costume sam
Chelt scene Uk	‚ù§
Marcus Quidenus	There will be a lot of haters, but for me their new songs are a little bit to slow and kinda sluggish. I like their new music too, but not as much as their older songs.
Peter Baker	Is it just me or if you listen to the chords underneath the mid section, it sounds a lot like Memento Mori.
Imran Sahir	Architects and While She Sleeps are two of the greatest bands in business right now. WSS is a bit underrated but they'll get there. I can't wait for this album.
Michael Pfund	Hearing memento mori references in the chorus ü§î absolute banger üí•
Aeour	Sounds like they're about to release yet another masterpiece.
Jesse Stewart	They can do no wrong.. dying to hear this album!!

JD Carfield	Damn, man. I was one of those guys yelling "SYLOSIS!!!!" in these threads on YouTube and IG and now I'm ashamed. Although Sylosis will always be my all time favorite, this band is the best thing out right now. Each song they've released off this album is special. I can't wait to hear the whole thing!
Dwayne Voisey	Gave it the thumbs up before it started because these guys are beasts

Bishal Bhattacharya	Am i the only one hearing a bit of memento mori in the chorus?

allseeingowl 1220	Who else expected a blegh in that beginning breakdown? Lol
Michael Chikviladze	I'm bit disappointed, there was no BLEGH! :(
Nick Johnson	I think it‚Äôs the weakest of the singles so far. It‚Äôs a good song. I don‚Äôt have a problem with it at all. Did Tom write all the technical guitar parts in LF/LT? The riffs were super sick. AOGHAU has slow but heavy hitting riffs, as does HH so far. I prefer LTLF, but I also love these.
Josh Torre	Best metalcore vocalist of the year!
just1goon	wow, just wow! its 6:45 atm in germany, im waiting to go to school, but im so flashed by these guys. cant wait to see them live in february here in germany..
Jesus H	goddamn, this will be my favorite architects album for sure.. insanely good.

andreasy 73	Damn, sounds and feels so good in my ears!
Emperor Gontier	Holy hell Will be an epic album
Jannis	Fact is : I love architects and their style. They‚Äôre good musicians and they know how to bring out bad ass songs  ...another fact is since Unbeliever the style never changed and every song sounds just like the one that got played before .
Erik Jason	Every time Architects is releasing another single/song is always definitely a masterpiece. They are heading in the right direction in this upcoming album.

David Ll	This is perfection
Toby K.	Jesus Christ my left year was not ready for that beautiful, brutal low end. 2 seconds in and I'm already hype.
D√°niel De√°k	Sick af.
Dark Incision	I pre ordered AND ITS FUCKING SIGNED Can't wait to get it guys x
Tommy The Krunk	I don't like how sam says modern misery so much. also the structure of the song is jarring which is not made better by a unimaginative and uncreative breakdown. I mean it's the same riff from the intro, speaking of which is played TWICE, tom is gone and sadly its starting to show.
Kyle	Is there light at the end of the tunnel guys?
Noah Stoddard	With these lyrics this had the potential to be really great song but the synchronization between the instrumentals and the vocals were off.
Mikey V	Loved it buttttttt where's the BLEGHHH that I look forward to?
William Moffatt	"I used to be a metal singer like you... Until I took an arrow to the heart."

Street Drummer	Yess!!! Loving those drums!
Robbie Jones	I‚Äôve always been a sucker for clean guitar. This song is the dope!
Christopher Robin	Holy. FUCK!  Words don‚Äôt do this masterpiece any justice.  The day will never come where the Architects disappoint me...
Cole Vick	Doing every thing in your power not to destroy your ears ability to process the album to come as a full piece is so hard to with every track these Gods put out, not to put every track on repeat until your ears bleed. But you can't do that. Fuck it. Ill rent more ears. This track is too damn good.
Richie Arriola	3:30 killed me
Huy Yang	Wow, everything they've released so far this year has been amazing.
Ricardo A	The only band with "society is shit" lyrics that I can't cringe to. Fantastic song.

Windson Elric	"Are these our new Messiah? Cos the savior has a gun to my head" There's a curious fact about this lyrics Brazil (where I'm from) elected a fascist piece of shit as the president today and his name is Messias (Messiah in Portuguese)
Jedidiah Bertram	4 tracks released so far. All 4 fucking brilliant!

diemonos 28	This song, to me, is the spiritual successor of Nihilist from AOGHAU, even in how it sounds, and as the other comments have pointed out, really does feel like it can fit in that album. But so do the other singles from the album so far!!! I also tried combining both album artworks just to see if they somehow fit, and holy hell, do they fit fucking perfectly.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqpA3fAUwAAcocn?format=jpg&name=medium  I swear this song is like a harmony part to Nihilist.

Enol Iskandar	Beautiful.

InfiniteR4iN	It took me 12 years to realize that I like hard music. 6 years more to realize that music can be so much more than something you listen to.   That was when I found Architects. I started to really getting into bands (not only this one), reading backstorys, interviews, lyrics. Search for things I could learn from songs. I fell into a hole because of bullying, anxiety and shit like that. I bought All our god have abandoned us. And it fucking saved my life. Short moments of bliss, 3 to 5 minutes each, made me rethink many things. Listening to the album over and over again kept dragging me out of my personal hell. At the next Architects show I visited, I cried my soul out. All the emotions. The ability to actually let them out triggered by simple words, sung by a normal person.  September '18, I fell into another hole. Broken heart, more anxiety, the fear of losing my job. Then Hereafter was released, Holy Hell was announced. And I just couldn't stop smiling. Probably one of the biggest smiles in my entire life. For me this band is more than just music. They made me understand what music means to me. They kept me alive. They brought light into my darkest days. And the sad thing is, I will never be able to thank them in person for doing more for me then most people on this planet. So I will write it down here.      Thank you Architects, for giving me the strength to fight my depression. For saving my life twice. And for making the fucking best music, I could listen to.     I look forward to your show in munich next year ‚ù§ So. this was my story. Short version but still longer than i thought it would be. And Thank you to everyone who made the effort to read this.

simone c	i'm a big fan of architects but this song its like a bonus track of "Lost forever lost togheter". Same ideas, same vocal line,an ambient already listened... but im hopeful for the rest of "holy hell" :P

NAS4	Siete mil millones de fantasmas hambrientos. Solo un par√°sito matando a su hu√©sped. El emperador no lleva ropa. Veo esos huesos quebradizos Pero estamos enterrados por la miseria moderna.  No hay suficiente agua en el mundo para lavar la sangre de nuestras manos  Plantamos una semilla Sus ra√≠ces asfixiar√°n el alma. Crece sin luz Y se alimenta de nuestros huesos. El infierno debe estar vac√≠o Todos los demonios estan aqui Cantando la oraci√≥n del Se√±or Finalmente, algo que todos compartimos.  No ir√© a la tumba Con la cancion todavia en mi  ¬øQu√© estamos escondiendo en la lluvia? Esta es una prisi√≥n para las almas perdidas. Otra vida rodea el desag√ºe. Sol√≠amos correr con los lobos. Ahora no podemos ver el bosque "Porque no hay luz en el agujero negro No trates de decirme que estamos bendecidos Sol√≠amos correr con los lobos.  ¬øSon estos nuestros nuevos mes√≠as? "Porque el salvador tiene un arma en mi cabeza No te dejes enga√±ar por Maya, los reyes son todos ladrones Y las serpientes morder√°n como les plazca. ¬øC√≥mo ha llegado a esto?  No ir√© a la tumba Con la cancion todavia en mi Y no vivir√© como un esclavo Rogando de mis rodillas No vivir√© como un esclavo No voy a rogar de mis rodillas No ir√© a la tumba Con la cancion todavia en mi  Sol√≠amos correr con los lobos.

Adrian Ruizvisfocri	Modern Bleghery!
angreband DRAGON	chelsea grin + old architects = ...
Piotr Jegli≈Ñski	How about all songs with videos?
Gimme Dopamine	I like it more than Royal Beggars but not as much as Hereafter. However, make no mistake, I love every song they have released so far. "We used to run with the wolves..." I interpret that as Mankind having strayed so far from our true nature. It's hard to judge a song from one listen. First impression is I love it. Will listen many more times. Can't wait to listen to the full album, from start to finish, over and over!

Matt V	I won‚Äôt go to the grave With the song still in me And I won‚Äôt live like a slave Begging from my knees  That hit way too hard! This video also shows us exactly where we are at in our society. Here is an example 2:16 - 3:15 Don't believe me? Look it up on YouTube.

Cam Kornacki	Hell yeah!√∑
valou78460	Error 404  Bleghhh not found
dragoezcurra	Good video. I'm shure most people can identify on it at some point in their lives. But, can the music stand up on its own? I'm not saying its a bad song, this is the type of songs that you need to listen a few times, then drop it for a week and then you'll like it. It is not a beautifull peace as it is Hereafter and Royal Beggars. The intro guitar riff is a bit lazy, sounds more like a bridge than a intro, I was waiting for the metalcore cliche "UHHHHHHH BLAGH" tbh. Anyhow, a week from now I will enjoy this song and I'll regret my comment on it, but this is my first thoughts.
Abelina Salvatore	That warmed my heart, what a masterpiece üò≠üòç

InsomniZach	Architects is really out there making metalcore great again.
Louis Gibbins	I can really feel Tom in that lead guitar...
Shinuzui	Royal Bleghgars > Bleghafter > Modern Bleghery
J C	I love it.  If I have one criticism it's that in their previous songs their lyrics had so many meanings and were my favourite part of listening to their music. Now the lyrics are a little all over the place. And where was the blegh in this song. That's Sam's trade mark that we all love.   So excited for the new album.

Luffy Joke Central	The synths and ambience progression around the chorus remind me of "all Love is Lost".
