Algernon Blacker	This band is fricking amazing I love what they stand for and they are coping so well with what happened Tom guy never stop making music ü§ò
Dan Vernon	I m not quite sure feel like I m guessing way more than with Royal Beggars but I think I got my very own interpretation of what this track is about Throughout the video we have this glass cube in which they all perform but Sam who at some point towards the end ha managed to break out of it I believe this cube to symbolise a cage putting your mistake on display for everyone being transparent to others a messiah not wearing any clothes Reference to line 3 4 The fact that Josh Ali and Adam have in some way a connection to the computer or smartphone in the video and are not being shown to live outside of the that cube somehow lead me to the thought that this cage of glass is supposed to reflect our identity online We are transparent we are flawed without showing shame we are naked in a very abstract way And most importantly we are caught in this image of ourselves on the web This is a prison for lost soul Then there s Dan who suffocates on the table with Ali facing him and not caring at all It seems like the mobile in Ali s hand is not only distracting him from the situation it became more important and hinders him from feeling empathy He watch Dan die stand up and take picture of the scene rather than feeling connected to what s happening in any way The whole verse We planted a seed and so on seems to underline that once more Josh is starting to bleed from the eye in a very similar manner he did in Royal Beggars where he sat in front of a TV and smoked Ali is on his phone not quite yet effected by it Adam is busy working handing Josh stuff to do and thereby contributing to Josh s destructive behaviour I mean that sentence sound weird but Josh is literally bleeding so I guess Adam too life in the box but on a passive level while it s slightly more of an active act for Ali even more so for Josh who destroys himself On the other side we have the very frequently occuring picture of Sam with an arrow in his chest hit like a hunted animal like a wolf that ha been shot down Running with the wolf to me stand for a more natural way of living than being caught in this horrific crate of glass and now we can t see the forest basically reminds u of how far we have strayed from living freely how far from being wild and not killing ourselves He is in his room not falling for the destructive lifestyle I won ‚Äô t go to the grave with the song still in me and I won ‚Äô t live like a slave begging from my knee He life with the pain because he belief it is what s right and doesn t trust false emperor or saviour That s all I got I m sorry for it being a bit rough and way to long And now please someone finally explain to me what the sunflower in every room but the cage is supposed to mean I can t make sense of it Thank you all for reading and if you stuck with me I really appreciate it Of course this is just my take on the song dunno if it s any better than guessing Cheers
SYTHEOPATH 1	I know I m not the only one who expected a BLEGH 00 30 ü§£
Jestermac02	Ok now Some people say that this song is similar to All love is lost or the chord progression sound like Memento Mori For me the bachground melody in Modern Misery is clearly different than the one in All Love is lost And i actually hear no similarity between this and Memento Mori Maybe my ear are fucked up but can someone explain to me where the connection between those song come from I mean they definitely have the Architects sound but for me these are all very different and awesome song

InfiniteR4iN	It took me 12 year to realize that I like hard music 6 year more to realize that music can be so much more than something you listen to That wa when I found Architects I started to really getting into band not only this one reading backstorys interview lyric Search for thing I could learn from song I fell into a hole because of bullying anxiety and shit like that I bought All our god have abandoned u And it fucking saved my life Short moment of bliss 3 to 5 minute each made me rethink many thing Listening to the album over and over again kept dragging me out of my personal hell At the next Architects show I visited I cried my soul out All the emotion The ability to actually let them out triggered by simple word sung by a normal person September 18 I fell into another hole Broken heart more anxiety the fear of losing my job Then Hereafter wa released Holy Hell wa announced And I just couldn t stop smiling Probably one of the biggest smile in my entire life For me this band is more than just music They made me understand what music mean to me They kept me alive They brought light into my darkest day And the sad thing is I will never be able to thank them in person for doing more for me then most people on this planet So I will write it down here Thank you Architects for giving me the strength to fight my depression For saving my life twice And for making the fucking best music I could listen to I look forward to your show in munich next year ‚ù§ So this wa my story Short version but still longer than i thought it would be And Thank you to everyone who made the effort to read this
