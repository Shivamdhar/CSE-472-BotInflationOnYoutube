Lazybeatrice Sm	Am i the only one who notice how usa is the only team that shout like mental... i think is bit distracting for other teams
Elvis Alves	Artur Dalaloyan is more handsome guy
srdtpa	congrats to the CHN team ✌ 💪 💪
한민석	Is it just me? I feel like the coverage of Yul Moldauer seems to be ignored or avoided in nearly every event. What's this about? I think I saw him in only one event here throughout, but he was mentioned on the sidelines several times. And no Shirai floor even though the announcer says it would be shown at the end. You guys are sloppy and slacking.
Octavio Jauregui	Rusia el mejor
Hoang Lan	They try to get low scores with Russian athletes. These injustice judges, they will be punished
Richard Marker	What happened to kakeru tanigawa? Why isnt he competing as part of the japanese team?
karina quintero	What I great competition! It's a shame por Russia my favorite team but I guess it was fair. They have their chance until the last moment. Hope Dalaloyan and Nagornyy can medal in the all around.
Ki Hi	Is it Yoder from team USA who constantly screams like a total nutcase? I understand chearing  your team mates but he is  litteraly yelling, all I can hear is his voice, it has to be very distracting for all the other competitors who perform at the same time. Just stfu man.
Gabriel McDonough	russia ♥
Matussita A	Noooooooi. I can’t believe it.
