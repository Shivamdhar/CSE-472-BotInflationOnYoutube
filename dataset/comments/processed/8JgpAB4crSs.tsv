Lazybeatrice Sm	Am i the only one who notice how usa is the only team that shout like mental i think is bit distracting for other team
Elvis Alves	Artur Dalaloyan is more handsome guy
srdtpa	congrats to the CHN team ✌ 💪 💪
한민석	Is it just me I feel like the coverage of Yul Moldauer seems to be ignored or avoided in nearly every event What s this about I think I saw him in only one event here throughout but he wa mentioned on the sideline several time And no Shirai floor even though the announcer say it would be shown at the end You guy are sloppy and slacking
Octavio Jauregui	Rusia el mejor
Hoang Lan	They try to get low score with Russian athlete These injustice judge they will be punished
Richard Marker	What happened to kakeru tanigawa Why isnt he competing a part of the japanese team
karina quintero	What I great competition It s a shame por Russia my favorite team but I guess it wa fair They have their chance until the last moment Hope Dalaloyan and Nagornyy can medal in the all around
Ki Hi	Is it Yoder from team USA who constantly scream like a total nutcase I understand chearing your team mate but he is litteraly yelling all I can hear is his voice it ha to be very distracting for all the other competitor who perform at the same time Just stfu man
Gabriel McDonough	russia ♥
Matussita A	Noooooooi I can ’ t believe it
