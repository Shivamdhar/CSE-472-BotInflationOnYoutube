The Wright Way Makeup	smart man
Ty Clark	what a fuckin loser lmao
Gerald Peters	This is how I did it. I worked b lue color jobs, we lived on my wife income and we saved all mine and bought 1 house a year. In 10 years we had 12 rental properties. At end of 10 years my profit on the houses after all expense around $40,000.  To be honest I didn't go as hard at it as I could have.
Quaalude Charlie	I retired at 34 years old , It was SSI/SSDI  , Benefits , and living  very thrifty :) QC
T D	Did this bloke just imply you are going to make 70k a year at Walmart? At age 18?Without a degree?
Ed	Four years working at Walmart earning enough to save £100k? I assume he means more than stacking shelves.  Actually, there's something to what he says.  College debt is crazy.
Chris McKenzie	I agree except for the whole investing in real estate part.
cattails nice	Love this guy love it people won't get this message because they are brain wash by society 
Susan Miller	DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL !!! AVERAGE LOSS SITTING IN CLASS IS $75,000 OVER 4 YEARS AT MINIMUM WAGE !!!! 
dave underwood	Jeremy Hines. this is the smartest shit. my dad pushed me to go to college. I was wrote off as a loser in my family because I almost failed out of high school. tried community college and failed. I figured, now lets do what I fuckin want for once. got into a trade, became an electrician and saved every penny and started buying houses and renting them out and self taught myself everything about real estate through u tube, books , rental meetings. learned about delayed gratification, ethics. self motivation. how to treat people well and pay them on time with compliments as I paid them. I own 20 houses and bring in around 160,000 a year. Jeremy Hines open your brain and let it in bro.
Carlos Brown	no
Dibiase	I'm a married man with 4 kids. My wife just lost her job. I am employed and we are suffering financially. I keep my faith in God not people like this guy.
univibe23	4 yrs working at Wallyworld you make 100K dollars??! Maybe pesos!!
Bon Ski	 I guess your kids arent in college...
Suzie D.	My Goodness..You mentioned Baby Jesus  and your Balls. Your funny!  You Asked for what you want... I wish you the best...& yes I subscribed to your channel.
Kazathul	Yeah.... because doctors graduate from a barns, mechanical engineers come from body shops, and architects learned it by playing legos. Why don't you get a brain first.
Jeremy Hines	This is the fucking dumbest shit I've ever heard with a GIVE ME MONEY at the end.  Dumb ass shitttttttt.
redmond424	I payed off my mortgage and credit card debt several years ago using The Dividends Pay My Bill Method (Google it). My monthly bills are now paid by investment dividends... I go fishing whenever I want to. You can too! All of my neighbors still have big mortgages, lots of debt, and no free time. I am semi-retired in my forties. 
Sohaila Rahimi	College might be a waist of time, but it depends what major, you should do both, that's what I did.  How ever I did invest in an income property with my brother and trusted him with out any real documents, and he gives me an apartment to live under his super vision, in a way he thinks it doesn't belong to me.  The thing is, it's not like he needs it, he owns a lots of properties and is a millionaire, and Bill is right, he bought properties from day one, so did my sister and they are both rich, money wise, but unfortunately very poor mentality.
Porsche 911 Turbo	I HAVE ACCEPTED EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SAID AND WILL DO AS YOU COMMAND MASTER 
Super Drive	Do both College and Real Estate at the same time. Why not ..
Knight Walker	hahaha I swear I love this guy hahaha
JollyRoger	* facepalm * what the hell is he talking about... work at walmart and invest in real estate... wtf?
DJ Botha	why the big pause.... 
Mel c	Why aren't your retired at 40? 
derrick kunstmann	College 100% depends on what topic you study. I took a single year of college and now make $110,000 a year at age 21... Move to areas of the country with the highest demand in work and pick a high reward career path.
riley davilla	depends on your career path, I joined the Navy, and have free college, and a great job making $18/hr working for the gov while going to school... I guess it depends on your situation, I do it because I get to help others.. not for the $$$ ...lol
Suki Gaddu	I live in the UK, I followed his advice. Many thanks to him, I am comfortable.
Brad K	The CEO  makes at least that much.
Manuel Moran	I'm a Medical Doctor. What would be your advice on how to build a thriving practice, with other Docs working for the practice, gaining more patients, opening other clinics, etc...?
xpicklepie	immigrants from all over the world risk thier lives to come to america to participate in capitalism. there is opportunity here for people who want to work at becoming successful. the "factory worker" mentality of so many crybaby/whiners who want to live like sheep is a choice.
castaway140	Hey Guys, I Was able to make $2000 in my first month working from home, and I only worked about 30min a day, Let me Show you how I did it, Message me here on youtube or shoot me an email at stevenroberts93024@gmail.com Talk to you Soon! Steven Roberts 
KingFC163	Who the fuck makes 100k working at walmart lol
Kevin Nathaniel	OR i could write a book and charge money to tell you how to make money ;) its a win win.
Troy Mason	Well in my case Im doing a short degree in law and getting licensed but no debt for me.
Skull Shaver	You are right about not going to college. If you want to retire by 40, stay out of debt and pay as you go. Be smart about money spending and have hard assets to fall back on. By age 40 there is no reason a man shouldn't own a small fortune of assets and have a plan to stay ahead financially... rather its working at walmart or owning a business or both.
Sensei Steve	I have your "Shoalin Master" Poster on my office door -Thanks for all of your great encouragement. I'm a better martial arts instructor and leader because of the action principles. -Big Thanks Bill.
John David	I love this guy but 40 years is too old to retire. I will teach you to retire in 2 months. All youll have to do is put in 15 mins a day eventually. Go to Proper Income dot com. I will give you step by step videos, just follow the instructions
orangedac	You are about 5 to 10 years too late to be launcching a house flipping scheme.  That game is over with.    
Johnathan Baker	WOW,I like your approach,Im 48 and have been doing lawns,small engine repair, etc.since was 15  ,but Ihavent  saved any money, and Im worried because Im running out of time  .I do have 1acre of land,Its paid off.  Ieven have a brown belt in karate...lol..     
LE0's Yoo_tube	Haha what a hack he's hyping real estate. Anyone who followed his advice and bought investment properties before the massive nationwide crash would now have more debt than asset's.   The unemployed college grads you speak of just did a waste of time degree like art or history.  
Dave W	I agree, though I think the description to the video is too long.
