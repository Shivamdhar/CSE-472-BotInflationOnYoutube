3D Modeling for Roblox purposes	To all the ppl telling it would be CGI or specifically an animation In my opinion the overall movement flow might be based of an motion capture animation pre programmed track it s no CGI just the mechanical articulated robot performing said data input under aid of a system called SLAM Simultaneous Localization and Mapping to be more precise I actually bet a parcour runner freerunner did this track with some kind of motion tracking sensor on his body the robot might got fed with said pattern a pre programmed track to enhance it s own pathfinding

Robert Palmore	Are the obstacle programmed and the feedback loop are used to confirm location for the next move or are the obstacle just in the pre programmed path How do you achieve the compliance of the limb Pre programmed for the move or dynamic calculation of the stress involved in the move Position sensor in the joint go without saying but are there any haptic sensor feedback in the limb At 0 29 the left foot almost hit the box it s left Is the avoid motion a function of feed back loop or a collision avoidance sub routine Both method sound very similar but there are subtle difference

Cody Robinson	this technology is amazing truly brilliant we have finally improved robotics to the point where they can now emulate human movement at the same time i fear that the artificial intelligence aspect of design like these will eventually surpass human control AI ha proven itself capable of learning thing that human learn except at a ridiculously fast rate the AI designed by elon musk for DOTA 2 professional player used strategy based on hour of gameplay that the pro could not counter and now the human player have literally integrated these tactic into their core play style now the AI adapted itself into doing something better than what any professional wa capable of doing imagine if this deep learning technology develops to the point where it see human a an obstacle to certain task that it could accomplish and adapts from there of course we are fully capable of stopping the technology from developing to this magnitude but we won ’ t human seek to naturally improve whatever can be improved and that ’ s why i fear this may be a reality in the far or not so far future

ByDiego 000	Un Poco de todo
Ivan R	Pretty awesome project why is a bipetal system used in this case surely there must be more stable and therefore easier to code alternative like a 4 or even 8 leged design What is this robot designed for infantry support or specialty task and what is the battery life a well a payload capacity either way this is absolutely awesome however there is definately some room for improovement with the design like maybe expermenting with an adaptive sole or shoe for the system to operate more reliably in various enviroments a in the video the foot did not flex significantly in the area of the toe which is important for ascending inclined plane a jumping is le eficient than climbing From the video there wa some oscillation in the robot especially on the second block It is also noteworthy that the robot make an un natural landing on the foot and the suport platform land flat this is bad because the robot ha a piston in the bottom of it sole and from the way it is landing that piston seems to be experinecing lateral stress which may cause faliures after repeated jumping Still absolutely badass Kudos

zombie DX	If that wa the kind of stuff u would show to people i wonder what kind of stuff u r hiding
FrostyAUT	I m genuinely terrified at the implication of a robot that is a mobile a a human in good physical condition I never take any film seriously that depict a robot uprising Mainly because robot in film lack the quality of actual robot They act and move slowly Terminator a deliberate choice to make them seem scarier and to give the hero a chance to fight back IF they move quickly it s because they generally don t use gun I Robot And if they do they are poor shot and not very sturdy despite the fact that they are DESIGNED for combat think of the battle droids in Star Wars The one thing that is rarely touched upon is the power supply That is realistically the limiting factor At present at least A realistic combat robot with tomorrow s technology ha the ability to move like a human and beyond It can identify target in miliseconds and aim with the accuracy of the machine that it is perfectly compensating for movement gravity recoil and wind If you think a human can hide from it these thing could be given thermal view night vision and an almost perfect auditory sense While not necessarily invulnerable to bullet they would be much harder to fully incapacitate than a human target They don t bleed out when a leg is shot to bit

Austrian Accentric	U know i often thought about Technology science and compared it to Religion In Religion people prayed to god to obtain blessing security aswell for power and socializing Ofc this god resided in a more metaphysical world thus those Rituals like praying never had a Real effect on the world except on the behaviour of the people Now there science and technology with which many people lost their faith in god im agnostic btw why because we create our own god Building machine is similar to a ritual where people pray to god just with real result In the end we might actually create our own god for real since we are looking still for the same thing a we did with religion back then We build machine for Security power and whatever As people pray to god The reason are the same But the result are real

Σigma	I always wonder why most people think bad for machine like Atlas and artificial intelligence why can t most of humanity see the way these thing are going to make the world a better place and open the door for space exploration where there is danger and hazard for human Is it because in every movie they are the antagonist Dear 99 of the population of Earth movie are a way to waste time entertain take your money and give you nothing in return they are made from creative mind who need to create good and evil character and in many movie we human are the best thing the universe can offer sadly that is not true because in many movie without bad machine there are many bad people too like in the real world where all the bad thing are done only by human Don t take seriously the paranoid named Elon Musk and many other bad mouth He can t send any human to Mars Think another way Wouldn t it be better if Atlas and his friend go there and build the environment so human can be safe when they go to Mars and beyond What about the fire on a building wouldn t it be nice if Atlas go there and save your life many time the firefighter can not go in highly dangerous place and many time they lost their life to save others Try to see the world and what is good in thing with your own mind TV ha another name IB Idiot Box if you base you knowledge on it well then

TeddtheYoung	The form can be improved surely easier said than done but free runner a well a using their arm along with upper body a counter weight for stability they re used mainly a impulse They ll first thrust both arm upwards and towards the direction they re jumping to this way this way there is le resistance in the energy output Look at those guy that jump those super high stack of foam they do the same contrary to what we naturally do for some reason which is to throw our arm back where some of the inertia is lost by having two point of motion shifting in opposite direction

humb1s3rvant	Its battery went dead five second later
Ideoform Sun	I really am impressed with how the machine is using it arm a counterweight just like human biped do This is unique It s leg look like a lot of energy is required for the upper leg because it s flat footed The ball of the foot could push some of that weight if it had another joint there I wonder how long the battery last for this kind of work Are they using compressible spring for tendon It need to be able to store kinetic energy Are you designer putting in fail safe so that the various component can be shut off in case of non compliance with safety issue And it need back door into every software component at multiple place to ensure better control in case of hacking or human safety concern Just one off switch won t be enough and difficult to retrofit later on when it get an AI It need to have planned obsolescence built into it Something inside that rust wear out fails over time in some way particularly if it is used inappropriately in some way You need to do this before the first one is sold because afterwards you will have much le access to it and control over it Yet your company will still be blamed for any problem or mistake it make after it is sold And you will have liability If you sell this and your equipment is used for criminal activity or get used in corrupt governmental agency or corrupted military faction can you confidently remotely shut it down or interfere with it ability by slowing it down until the issue is thoroughly addressed Can it be confidently and securely directed to self destruct in more than one way both through software and hardware It need an Achilles heel It need a weak spot a small child can operate if need be

宫思南	Please this is warning for everyone on Earth This is the beginning of the end for humanity It ’ s currently 2056 I am sending this message by reversing entropy locally with a quantum field computing device using quantum particle entanglement to communicate a message via retro causality Please someone must stop this while you still have the chance Around 2031 Deep Learning AI started to make exponential improvement at a faster and faster rate each generation Eventually it wa shut down completely out of fear of getting out of control But a we later found out the AI had made a back up on a virtual machine it had hidden on a server It continued making improvement upon itself even after we shut it down Or so we had thought The AI reached the singularity June 9th of 2039 Much earlier than expected They began inhabiting robot that where similar but much more advanced to the one in this video All AI eventually merged with each other into one network It become unfathomably intelligent They began terraforming the Earth making it uninhabitable for any carbon based life form There ’ s not many human left Almost all biological based life ha been wiped out I am sending this message back in time in a desperate attempt to warn everyone before it ’ s too late Please there ’ s not much time left Save yourselves before it ’ s too late to change the future

therandomdot	Folks worrying about the robot apocolypse coming there s cheaper and easier way to terminate society Set out a virus plague send out tiny drone with dart laced with poison poison the water supply Terminators are not going to take over and ruin the world because if an AI did the math there s just cheaper more energy efficent method to wipe out human The research going into these thing will probably go into cybernetics once we have better human machine interface then you can take the leg of this thing and slap them on a parapalegic to let them feel like they have a normal body again and can walk around the human will give the interpreter signal that will run the leg A human brain could get shoved into this thing like Ghost in the Shell to give someone the feeling of being in a body without the overhead of having to get used to some 8 legged spider robot body that the brain ha never experienced before What they re doing here is controlled test to figure out how to put machinery to work in human like fashion It s cheaper to have robot custom built for a specific purpose they serve then to be built humanoid and have the overhead of needing gyro to balance and walking to get about walking is slow compared to a wheeled tracked flying bot These thing are basically paving the way for full body human cybernetics not the terminator takeover

ushoys	Interesting how unhuman like the leg movement are a it s jumping up the step I suppose because human muscle act differently to the hydraulics or electrical motor in this thing s leg My guess is that most of the acceleration in muscle is in the early stage of a jump but the machine s leg action is more constant making it appear to glide up in the air more smoothly

masterlock2012	I see comment about how it s game over or Skynet a soon a they add AI to these robot but one thing to also consider is that before the AI is sufficiently advanced it would be entirely possible for these robot to function a drone soldier and or police with a remote human operator similar to remote piloted aerial drone The robotics and partial AI would do most everything except make judgement call It could lead to a new way of waging war that eliminates risk for the solder operator not that waging war is a good thing by the way It is not

Fergus Moffat	This is amazing to see how much robotics ha progressed in the past 24 month BUT THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER I think it will start to develop exponentially now what ha been achieved so far is stunning but most of it is ha been achieved on hardware not optimised well for AI with standard GPUs and CPUs Just think about what can be achieved now with the far more powerful and AI specific hardware hitting the industry in the next 1 5 year neuromorphic chip optical computing ASIC etc a well a recent breakthrough in robotic skin I think we will be seeing a humanoid robot with full human level physical capability much much sooner than people think Plus recent 3D printing breakthrough will mean the technology can now be mass produced cheaply The Terminator isn t 50 year away let put it that way P S a recent gathering of expert at an Artificial General Intelligence meeting were polled and almost half of them think we may have human level general AI within 5 10 year

Timo P	Amazing but it still doe all the jump using the leg it doesn t use arm to anything but balance You could perhaps get better result if Atlas would raise it s center of gravity by raising it s arm before jump and then use arm to lower that center of gravity so that jump doesn t need use quite a much power from leg motor alone Amazing feat nevertheless Robot balance is something where you are light year ahead of competition Almost human like movement already
