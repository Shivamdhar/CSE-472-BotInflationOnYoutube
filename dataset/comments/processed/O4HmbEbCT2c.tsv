jody 107	never even on a boat 4fs
t0nda	What did I just watch A tour in the museum of just standing there stuff without further use I mean it is certainly not the worst idea to spend on real estate but there is a major hook with this one It consumes too much money each and every day maintenance staff security utility Plus it is not the real estate which drive the price but it is the interior design Which ha little of an additional use most thing are just prop for meeting another alleged superlative Personally I feel that that mansion is just uncozy a patchwork of expensive wannabe item which just do not fit in my eye There are a lot of tasteful expensive mansion around but this to me seems just cobbled together in a giant shopping spree only looking for price tag but not for look Perhaps the tour would have been more convincing if held based on a social event in some gem√ºtlich fireplace room Just have a nice 20 people party and show how the mansion doe when put to use If there is any room which feel liveable that is Because a an asset to invest in it doe not seem straightforward High running cost and the main part of the money doe not even seem to be real estate but prop which may and will drop in value most probably Even if I liked the artwork or item in it I would just purchase those which I like but not the whole package Good luck selling it It certainly ha some nice aspect in spite of all my criticism

RifiFeooo	First of all someone that ha that kind of money to buy such a house doesnt spend much time at home Secondly that ha so many feature that in the end it becomes pointless I mean of course billionaire have crazy house and yacht and other stuff but that is an exaggeration Why have a 30 seat cinema in your house instead of a 10 15 for example Imagine living on your own there How many time are you gon na have company to enjoy all these You are constantly reminded that you are alone Its depressing Only Dan Bilzerian with his 20 chick would use that space Otherwise I fail to see the point
Lithian Haim	It s hilariously fugly If someone ha that much time and money to buy the space the craftsmanship why not hire someone who actually ha taste Just compare this to the home of an aristocrat make this look a heap of rubble although the base material are similar high class The prettiest room wa the closet By far

aikenbcd	The house is great It is just totally overpriced It they sold it for let s say 30 million it would make sense to me But 188 million Dollar And I have seen this offered for 250 million Who on earth would spend this much for a house Even if somebody owns let s say 5 billion then probably most of it is invested in stock of his company Even with 5 billion you wouldn t give away that much money for a house They would have to go down to say 30 million Dollars That would seem reasonable to me But 188 million for a house just make no sense Also why do they throw all kind of stuff in that you may not even want Why a basement full of car I can buy car myself It seems like they took everything expensive they had left and threw it in the basement It doesn t fit IMO

Scott Sophia	There are a number of misleading sale statement made at the beginning of this video 1 Yacht depreciation is nowhere near the level mentioned 2 On a home you have to pay property tax each year whereas you don ‚Äô t have this expense on a yacht each year California property tax are much lower than the rest of the country but depending upon the assessed value it could still be lofty sum 3 You will have much higher operating cost on a yacht but the expense to maintain a house like this will be quite high a well 4 With all of these maintenance and annual expense the performance of real estate shouldn ‚Äô t be compared to investing in the stock market not to mention that unloading an asset like a house that list for over 150 million will most likely take quite some time and these type of home usually sell for well below list price and you will still have to pay capital gain tax assuming you made money off the sale 4 The value stated for a lot of the item are vastly overinflated That ‚Äô s not a 4 million dollar Bugatti I could continue but you get the point Always be skeptical of what someone say when they are trying to sell you something Especially if it ‚Äô s something of this level of magnitude
