IrwansS Sseptiawan	baru kemarin saya nonton 2 film besutan XYZ film pertama Mandy Nicolas Cage dan yg kedua ini Xyz film dari dulu memang terkenal dengan film action berdarah darah seperri killer dll mandy darah nya banyak tapi tak sefrontal film ini mandy menyuguhkan kekejaman yg tak dinampakan adegannya difilm ini kita disuguhkan perkelahian ala The Raid hingga banyak yg bilang ini Film The Raid yg ke 3 padahal bukan catat ya bukan film ini sama hal nya dengan Headshoot antagonisnya pun sama yg membuat saya Terperangah justru bukan perkelahian antara Iko dan Joe melainkan Pemain nya Seperti Dian sastro Dimas Anggara Abimana bahkan Morgan Oey mereka terkenal dengan Drama namun kali ini bermain di Genre yg baru bagi pengalamannya So Cool keren 7 7 Fresh Movie
fikri ardonugroho	clasicc crime stroy but good
Dunia Jenaka	Ada blooper yang sangat mengganggu di awal Waktu Joe Taslim di kamar mandi dan diperban sama cewek Ada yg gak berurutan Pertama sicewek masang perban ke perutnya Pas Joe menghadap cewek perbannya ilang Lalu scene selanjutnya perbannya ada Hahahha kelihatan banget miss nya Trus pa iko naik mobil di tol Suasananya malam saat mobil disuruh minggir udah pagi aja Bener bener banyak gak sequence gambarnya

Septino Andarswesa	The song Murderer Low which wa played during the last scene in The Night Comes for Us so hit Actually the meaning of the lyric is ironic The point is to explain that we commit murder in the name of God A kind of justification for how evil we are The point is fit to this film killing each other without feeling guilty even to kill criminal brutally

TRUTH ABSOLUTE	Did anyone else notice the subtle spiritual undertone of this movie The message concerning Redemption The message about sometimes still having to pay a price for the mistake you ve made in this life Like the 2 thief who were on the cross with Christ One of them wa basically repenting and acknowledging Christ while the other stayed hateful and spiteful The one wa doomed for the eternity but the other wa only physically doomed in the temporary for the mistake he made In the movie you can see a glowing cross outside of the apartment And a bit later the unrepentant and hateful female enemy turn the cross upside down on the wall I really liked these subtle touch
Bratislav Metulski	REALLY BAD TRAILER look like The Villainess meet The Raid 2 But I heard it the most brutal movie since year after the first 20 minuten there is nonstop splatter heroic bloodshed martial art is that true I dont like brutality just for the brutality in the raid 2 raid 1 wa fun but 2 suck in all way

watdaification	Gareth Evans paved the way for proper martial art action movie in the 2010 ’ s and now the trend he set finally ha a platform large enough to spread the awesomeness even more Sadly hollywood can never replicate this style pf choreography for their action movie since guy like Iko are martial artist first and actor second I mean keanu is good but not on this level The only guy that can come close would be the guy who played boyka but sadly hollywood doesn ’ t know how to use his talent properly
