Salim Ibrahim	Lol, it's not about race. It's about ability. It's about team needs.

Funnyfresh420	So hire black coaches because black lives matter? All lives matter bro. Lets stop racism by stopping racism on ALL fronts. Stop giving jobs to people based solely on the color of their skin sounds like a great start..... hiring the best candidates sounds like the best scenario. Not "hire what the law says you have to".
