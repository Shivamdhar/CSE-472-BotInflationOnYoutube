Aleth86	Reminds me of how Canada got higher drug price through Nafta but hey know how much insurance price it at
lefthandcigg 425	“ Call your dr if you experience death or coma because these are permanent ”
Xenithil	LOL it s a first amendment right violation Just like how food processor s first amendment right s are being violated when they have to soullessly put the content of the food on the label Give me a break
_Told_by_Ginger _	I wonder if this will apply to veterinarian price a well I had to pay an insane amount for my pet medicine
D Mal	If the drug company is worried that it may confuse people then just say your individual cost may vary according to your insurance policy Problem solved
Tenacious Z	Every doctor my family ha gone to the last five year push a prescription for every little thing We have to screen these and say yes to only what we know we really need At my last physical for example I had unconsciously blushed at some point during the woman part and she suddenly tell me I have rosacea and she ha a prescription to help me with that Geez
Alpha 150	Why can t the drug company just say drug A may cost around 300 for an average month of treatment but price may be reduced with insurance
Katie Little	Call your doctor if you experience death Lol
missaldavisvlogs	After living outside of the U S and then coming back I wa hyper aware of the commercial and am really bothered by them I would prefer that we didn t have ANY commercial so that doctor are provided u with an RX based on the medical need and not a medical want Example I should go to the doctor because I have a medical need such a a skin disorder that I want to care for and the doctor prescribe something to me and we can have a conversation on whether or not I can afford it RATHER THAN I saw a drug commercial that said it could help my skin and I should go to the doctor to discus the drug
Meghan Travers	So I don t need worry since I m a Canadian
IMKevin117 - Animations/Gameplays	If we show our price people might not buy it well no shit Sherlock At least if we see the price we have a good idea how much it ll cost WITHOUT our insurance Obviously everyone who go to the doctor always asks doe my insurance cover any of this so how the fuck wa that a good excuse It just seems like the pharmaceutical want to hide their price to milk everyone out of their money
Megamoon Polk	Weather it help lower the price or not it will for sure make it easier for people to know how much it cost and be able to ask better questiond when going to the doctor or pharmasist about pricing
Josh Willard	20 pill of Ambian in europe is €2 50
Grinnar	I wa misdiagnosed and it s messed me up in so many way even 14 year later where I m not on any of those medication
Michael Dillenbeck	Interesting thought This could just be an attack on television and medium The rule only hurt them Ads can still run a is on social medium internet May not have anything to do with pharmacy How many million are spent on cnn msnbc from drug manufacturer that may now spend the money elsewhere
Victerran	I am surprised that people buy medicine or spend any money in healthcare in the USA Ads have turned your brain into mush
teresa vance	Looks like a bait a and nothing Only one more thing where he claim to be sticking it to Pharma but really just a sticker He ll move on without ever having actually pulled off legislation
blaziken 1213	As someone who ha relied on the help of daily medication to survive my daily live for year I say that this move is a good first step for the government I think the pharmaceutical industry is ridiculous when it come to name brand when the off brand is cheaper for the exact same medicine I don t want to have to pay 20 30 more just because the drug ha a easier to say name than the rival company that keep the actual chemical compound name Of course they might have other factor that I am unaware about that make the brand Bane required but the basic form of the medicine is the same That being said I don t think this will pas in it s current form but at least to open the door for further discussion and alteration to the subject Thank you for reading my little soap box rant Have a great day
Joseph Armstrong	Why ha this video got half the normal view of philly D show Which often get 1 1M thi is s the average of the last 20 Answer big pharma
stringX90	I think this move while well intended will not lower drug price overall
Doctor What	I HIGHLY doubt this will change price Less profit put le money into R D and le research on new drug in the pipeline and that could save life because of different disease
Alphawolfy	Thank christ I live in the UK I would be a dead man without my medication the US healthcare system is a terrifying thing Advertising to the citizen In a proper system the doctor should be the only one offering up treatment option based on their professional judgement And the ungodly amount of money they charge for life saving medicine A healthcare system should be based on health not profit
P4L4D1N	every time the drug company fight back increase the range of restriction on drug
Mr. Grey	Meh they ll either stop TV ad or find a loophole
MMEnder	What doesn ’ t Canada have the whole ad for pharmaceutical thing too

nat lider	really enjoying the extra video thank you great to see big important news story getting coverage that I don t see many other outlet doing
Eric Nolen	Rock ON
Malcolm DuBose	“ Please see a doctor if you die ”
Anne Hijme	I agree in medical industry which includes pharmaceutical there is a problem The problem is getting upfront price for any good or service Try asking cost for any surgery from multiple place Almost all of them will avoid giving you a cost and just ask what insurance you have and that they do or do not accept that insurance If you have insurance they often try to tell you not to worry about the insurance will cover it even if it won t cover all of it I personally think advert are not the problem nor do I think it should be required to place price in advert To me the solution is insurance to go back to what it used to be in case of emergency and not for every day care That every day care should be a different sort of payment whether you want to pay every time you visit or get a deal like around here I see dentist advertise something like this and a FastMed or membership that give you free visit and discount for extra visit you may need for a set fee Now I know many of you think this is crazy but all insurance doe is hide the price and give doctor office and other medical group an excuse not to give you price upfront which make it impossible to shop around I work with an elderly man a my bos who get all sort of medical bill MONTHS after whatever he went in for The bill seldom ha a clear reference of what it is for or even when the event took place so he is always unsure whether it s been paid for already or if he should question it The total are always large with another large number for insurance then finally what the remainder is He also end up getting refund check sent to him for small amount since billing is such a mess that often time they sent the same bill twice so he paid twice Really medical need to be like other form of business get price upfront or clear estimate of what to expect aka range based on possible complication or need Another thing not uncommon in America is two get multiple bill for the same visit because one part usually the anesthetist is billed separately adding more confusion Final note Many doctor get affliation with drug company for deal that make the doctor encourage the use of that drug for benefit Also people in American culture prefer to pop a pill to solve a problem because it is easy and get to be not there problem I think if most pill were sugar pill we still have most people feeling better because they just felt the need for something outside to fix their life
idontcareuknow	I don t think it will do much It s a step in the correct direction but a stated in video list price isn t customer price The problem that really need addressed with healthcare is that insurance company hide the actual price No insurance company pay the list price for a procedure med they pay a totally different price which they agreed on during negotiation Basically insurance company are rich in large part because we don t know the market value of anything If you apply business law to healthcare it s actually totally illegal the standard payment industry compliance training about rubber duck or metal widget Really not sure how it got this way
Neil is Alive	If you experience Death for more than 8 hour please contact your doctor immediately
Maccabee Luke 22:36	This drug ha a 50 fatality rate but you should take it so that way you won t die
Cthulhe	I think being booted from a job for speaking your mind ha come too far Offense is taken not given and I think she honestly thought it wa ok Should I be offended at Halloween when people dress up a goth even though real life goth are still beaten to death to this day for being thus I wa raised and have always lived with goth culture my entire life so why should it be okay for people to dress up like u and mock about our culture whilst no one here probably even know who Sophie Lancaster wa
isolestie	I work in pharmacy and I don t know how effective this is gon na be Somebody s gon na be eating the cost if the company do lower drug price and it s most likely gon na be pharmacy This would lead to more cut on pharmacy personnel resulting in longer wait time and lower quality of service Most people are covered by the insurance so they won t see that much of a change anyway and biggest factor in high price for drug are monopoly so I don t know if people who get the medicine for life threatening condition will be able to afford it regardless We need an overhaul of how big pharma operates a well a the insurance company
Petra_Kalbrain	Easy solution Require listing the full price of the drug and adding “ Cost per individual will vary depending on insurance coverage ” I love this idea Big pharma is already beyond ridiculously shady in almost every aspect of their very existence and practice let alone their secretive pricing tactic Without a listed price before hand they can effectively manipulate the cost based on insurance coverage Someone who ha 50 coverage might be charged 400 and someone with 90 coverage could be charged 2 000 for the same medication Each customer is paying 200 out of pocket but big pharma isn ’ t treating them equally They can do this because nobody ever actually look at their receipt AND nobody ever really compare pricing with each other for this stuff
Mike___B	Great production guy I m not sure yet if I prefer it to the PDS style with the picture in picture approach of the usual show but the execution of what you were going for on this video wa stellar Also great topic to shed a light on Pharma is too huge to not be discussed regularly in all news forum So thanks a always
LezLamb	Am i the only one who noticed the new editing style in this video
jobriq5	coma or death a these may become permanent yeah death is pretty permanent
ChaosFigure	I ’ m from New Zealand and those ad are so few and far between
April P	If there is no financial accountability or penalty the drug company will do nothing Blowing smoke up their as wont work however a fire will move them As we are now our society run on money and feeling will not change it
Youtube Commenter	Real drug can not be advertised on TV Those are called accelerants
pythia delphi	This law would actually benefit insurance company more than consumer It would cause consumer to go for cheaper drug even if insurance might have covered the more expensive one
Tomi Soetan	“ Call your doctor of you experience any side effect such a death ” Might be a bit tricky to do that 😂
Lily	I moved from Canada to the States for work and had paid 20 mo for my prescription in Canada brand name without insurance ie cost price For the exact same medication and brand the cost price of my prescription in the state is 130 The difference is that the pill come in a suede packet instead of a paper packet Why is there such a difference in cost price between two neighbouring country
Caige Fuentes	I feel like this is a good move on the governor side but im worried thay cheaper price may lead to am increase in the already drastic misuse and abuse of pharmasutical drug
MrMorrigan	Americans pay more for insurance and legal drug than any other developed nation the profit margin is huge in the US So good thing someone think about the people for once and not the corporation
Victor Morales	Death is permanent Whaaaaa
Chuck Hartholz	I think the biggest mistake we can make is to allow Big Pharma to advertise directly to consumer Over the counter drug are one thing there is a certain presumption of safety and efficacy when taken a directed To watch these ad for prescription med is creepy scary and inappropriate “ Some side effect include depression or suicidal tendency If this happens stop taking this medicine immediately ” Totally fucked Bigger problem is how much money is being spent on these commercial encouraging the hypochondriac of our nation to boost sale preying on their desperation for that Magic pill Advertising price will encourage price competition so Trump is trying to enable market force to help bring price down It COULD work but the whole thing is still sickening to me
tjt072	I hate trump but the fact that he is actually trying to do something about this issue is awesome Don t know if it will work but it doesn t hurt to try I take inhaler for asthma and one of them cost me over 200 My insurance doesn t pay for medication There is no le expensive one either We have a discount card for it but it s still over 100 which we could use to eat or pay bill I need the inhaler to breath and these drug company take advantage of people like me who need certain med in order to stay alive Once they make their money back they need to make it le expensive and come up with a generic one
Klepto	I doubt this wa Trump s idea and it seems like a way to get people to forget that it wa his idea to gouge the health program Look it s not my fault you can t get those med it s the greedy company Could this still result in something good for consumer Yes I rather hope it doe a I have to spend 100 on med every month and a friend spends close to 400 I m still going to question the intent after everything they ve done
Jessy C	No I don t think so I think it ll cause a lot more bitching and moaning more awareness but at the end of the day people need their drug And Pharma know that
Sigusen	Please notify your doctor if you have any of the following symptom drowsiness irritability coma or death a these may become permanent Death MAY be a permanent side effect
Jennifer Cisneros	I take iron 3 time a day birth control for fibroid and too control my period that last 3 week I also take a migraine prevention medicine a I get them about 5 time a week now only 1 or 2 and I m currently covered by Medicare but in a year in wont be covered and I won t be able afford my medicine so idk what I m going to do
Thomas Clapp	Coma or death a these may become permanent
William Hale	It s not shaming the company that will lower the price They aren t child you aren t going to shame them you put their price out there so everyone know them then company that make drug for the same use are able to say hey our drug do the same but for 5 le then another company could come along and do the same to them
EverydaySkeptic	This come down to two thing the cost of the approval process and patent law Most peiple don t want to touch either for safety and productivity despite neither actually being the product of these regime
Jenni K.	Call your doctor if you have Coma or DEATH a it may become permanent but if you call it may just be temporary death
deadly zebra	in my experience whenever government get involved price dont drop
Ephy	I clicked this horrified that my med would get more expensive What a huge relief this wa instead I hope we re able to do this and decrease the cost of drug People are dying because they can t afford their med That s ridiculous P S I enjoyed this video a lot Very well edited Super cool Also I didn t have to see Phil s dumb face a much xp
Barbara Houk	What of a drug price is the FDA ’ s extortion That might make it clear how expensive that agency is
Brian Green	While something certainly need to be done about drug process shouldn t part of the conversation be about over prescribing
Lesley Tate	Death may become permanent America you re drunk go home
creativeusername_x	coma or death a these may become permnent
Cassie Banks	As in everything else Trump doe this just seems like a ploy he s lying about that will fade into nothing when foot hit the pavement Trump belongs to the rich white club of America of which the pharmaceutical industry is a leader Sure he ll make a bunch of noise about it to make his voter base think he s delivering on his promise but once the industry fight back he ll give up on it and blame it on them I predict nothing come of it
Saskia Smith	It s actually insane that the US let prescription drug being advertised on TV Do you realise how insane that is I mean American healthcare is bizarre any way Who ha to PAY for medical care It s crazy
Josh Keating	Or make it illegal to advertise prescription med to the public I can walk up to many place and buy many thing if I have the money all on my own I can not do the with a prescription drug so why the he ll is it advertise to me I get the concept of I then ask my doctor and if the doctor doesn t give me the script I may try a different doctor But if it isn t an item I have the power to purchase on my own it shouldn t be advertised to me
falloncj	This seems like a good way to try improve the system in America Of course you could replicate the approach in the rest of the world where we don t permit advertising of prescription drug Looking from the outside in America s approach to healthcare and blinkered vision to how other first world country don t face the same issue is astonishing
CheshireCat	My family and I always make fun of those advertisement 😂😂
Dino Spumoni	1 08 Death may become permanent You don t say
Irakproductions	How insulting Clearly the pharma company don t think highly of there user that showing the retail price would confuse people If people didn t handle price well and could not make proper decision with such information the economy would not cease because no one would be able to function
LetsTalk About	This may not actually work but I love the approach Someone need to do something about the industry I shouldnt have to work myself to death to be able to afford medication that I need so I don t want to kill myself Whether that s insurance company or pharma themselves something need to be done This spike isn t a mystery We re all just a penny in a billion dollar industry And right now there s people out there pushing expensive pill so they can get rich off our misery
Baleria Medina	I don ’ t know why they wouldn ’ t just not air the commercial if it didn ’ t follow the rule That sound far more effective then being put on a list
blaegme	If it go through then drug company will just join force with insurance company more closely and advertise a This drug normally cost but if you have insert sponsored isurance here then it will only cost for a full treatment And also there will be a larger incentive to reduce the production cost of their drug so a long a they maintain ethical practice then everyone win
Danelle DeRuse	Loving these extra video
Confused Beaver	I like the intro hello hello it s the morning show
WickedRibbon	Thanks for covering this 👍
GameDog	Death is usually permanent
HyDeph 0	legalize weed
Gigaheart	coma or death may become permanent Uh yah
tacklehisa	And people say trump suck
Puggles	Pharma nor your government doe not want you healthy Especially with cancer treatment They would never want you to buy a one time cure for your cancer when they can treat it for the rest of your life and bill you every step of the way They make BILLIONS just with cancer treatment There are medication that are helpful though But mostly they do nothing except treat symptom and end up screwing you up even worse in the long run causing you to get ANOTHER medication to treat that A K A The western pharma cycle The same thing is done for your pet too
dietmtnfuckyou	i ’ m bipolar and i buy medication constantly saying the price on ad would not do anything because everyone pay different price for their drug some people get great mental health coverage but awful coverage on other thing people go without insulin because their insurance doesn ’ t cover it it ’ s a huge problem that is with insurance and big pharma listing price would just cause mass confusion and people going without medication many GOOD doctor will give you coupon sample and referral for different type of coverage but if you ’ re barely getting by or on medicare disability you have to only go for cheap alternative many people don ’ t even have the option of coupon because the price would be too high but people will avoid all treatment if told right away they will have to pay this amount for this medication medication isn ’ t a luxury it is a necessity to say the price is acting like it ’ s a car for sale when it ’ s actually the difference between life and death so i don ’ t think saying the price will do anything it ’ s an entire system that need changed
Alexandra Seppey	Easy solution to the varied cost due to insurance add a fricking disclaimer xxx xx full retail price Actual cost will vary based on your insurance
Avie Dabber	“ coma or death a these might become permanent ” ok but how tf am I supposed to contact my doctor about my possibly permanent death Like No
CocoaGeisha	coma or death a these may become permanent WHAT I bet the woman reading that voice over wa thinking IDGAF a long a I get my check
charlespk2008	i am surprised that he is making any regulation at all but it is clear this is just a fake no real consequence mean nothing will really happen other then Trump being able to say he kept his promise
Ntin	We get these ad in Canada too
Rashid Al-Suwaidi	I don t have no clue whether or not this would affect drug price But I see no reason drug company shouldn t be more transparent with pricing
Rinoa Super-Genius	Big Pharma should have been required to show their price year ago i agree with this
Weewoo	fuck yes i love this so much
Oggie Doggie	it s about time with my insurance there is like a 3 month period i have to pay 50 of my drug cost and i have s single need that i need to live that cost 6000 our of pocket for a 3 month supply there is no way anyone can afford this this is a coverage Gap built in to the medicate prescription plan that i have so i blame big pharma and our gov for this issue
BillyC500	Was VERY surprised that something like this happened is starting with this administration I do believe price will come down but I doubt in any largely meaningful way at least not across the board or even close to it But I do see it being impactful in specific case Even if this had no effect on price I think this is a HUGE step in the correct direction Medical expense and service are about the only thing an American citizen buy while being clueless to the cost To the misleading claim about not being an accurate depiction of what the end customer pay well I positive they have market research that ha fairly accurate idea of the end cost to consumer narrowed via many factor including coverage level
GAMINEX	Is this video sped up in the beginning
nab 6215	You didn t go nearly far enough Check out organ rejection drug They got a boost a well What are these folk supposed to do What about the EpiPen What about how usual drug changed to be taken from 3 time a day to 1 time a day and they are able to renew their paten and the cycle start all over again
Kyle The Celt	Then there ’ s u over here in Scotland with free prescription Whoooo 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Tasunke	Trump administration is very smart They know their republican SCOTUS will never allow this to pas
Jo 🎃	I m kinda confused Why are there advertisement for drug when it s down to dr s to prescribe them Maybe there s something I m missing here I m not American
Alex Van de Riet	I m no Trump fan but I really like where this is possibly heading
fernando jesus	Look I ’ m a conservative and I think this is very important They should put their fucking price on add and on their website These fucking company rip people off and fucking over price their product
Collin	Imagine going to buy a sandhwich at Subway and them having to tell you that the sandwhich shop down the street is cheaper
Atomix	Do people really see an ad for a drug on TV and then go to their doctor and ask about it Anything I ve been prescribed ha always been a doctor s recommendation I don t think I ve ever asked about a specific drug in my life
tiber1978	This is certainly better than doing NOTHING and letting the company be able to have carte blanche and do wtf they want
ThatLittleKitten	Are these new graphic If so nice I haven t seen this show in a while so idk
Andrew Deck	Thanks for the extra video
Atiba22	coma or death a these may become pErManenT
Trevor Colby	So the solution to outrageous drug price is to advertise them I m pretty sure people already know they are getting screwed At best this will slightly lower the price of a few drug but it will not add any new competition This is a distraction they are merely pretending like they are doing something to help the American people meanwhile they aren t really doing anything They want u spending our time debating this instead of real solution Don t fall for the bullshit
sanguisuge	i have an idea just stop advertising to consumer make the drug company have to go to doctor to get their medicine sold
Allan Zoomfig	Its refreshing to see something good come out of this administration good job guy
Sarkazz Vlogs	I don t think it will cause them to lower price Pharmacies being the biggest drug dealer know that people rely on these medication
ice322	trump keeping MORE campaign promise
Samwise The Grey	They should ban pharma from making TV ad altogether
Jackie Hall	I wa reading at my pain management Dr office that some place are wanting to start taxing opioids I take pain pill every day of my life because I have 5 herniated disc If I don t I can t walk There are day I take le other day I have to take more It is going to suck if this happens I don t think people who have chronic pain should be penalized because they have to take med to function We are already suffering Texas where I live wa not listed but if other state start doing this why wouldn t they eventually start doing this a well
erkdoc5	Drug company who gouge price to make insurance company pay more are getting mad that they might have to show people that they are gouging price Sounds about right
Pudding	YEAH America
Stephanie Burke	Even if I ’ m a day late I love the extra show And I think this is a small step in the right direction for change in big pharma
Amy Howell	“ Coma or death a these may become permanent ” scuse me wot
Bedardo	Don t let Trump fool you He s only going after American Pharma because it s rumoured that I response to tariff law are going to loosen on bringing drug in from Canada at a cheaper cost
David Finch	What is to stopping them from pulling all tv ad if they will not have to disclose the price in print social medium or the internet
Terilkin Flamewood	The amount of people watching television is constantly decreasing meaning the effect of these pharmaceutical change will be decreasing a well If they really want this to have any effect then they should branch out to internet website a well like YouTube
katiejon17	This is fantastic It really is I m an RN and drug price are ridiculous If a patient can see the reality of what a drug cost most are going to ask their provider for a generic or another option THIS is why healthcare is so expensive THIS is how pharmaceutical take horrible advantage of people Even those with insurance that cover expensive med all patient should care about this because it hike up insurance cost too which fall back on u to cover Man I didn t vote for Trump and I feel like a fool
Kay Garcia	Big pharma make big money There s no reason for them to keep charging such steep price for medication if 7 out of 10 people have a prescription they re still going to be making a lot of money I ve heard about people going without their insulin for day because they don t have the money for it If it s a necessity the price should be affordable no exception However prescription medication have such bad side effect that if not completely necessary people should look for healthier alternative So many people have died or almost died due to the high number of drug out there that do more damage than good That being said a lot people could benefit from making healthier choice Eat your veggie and fruit don t depend so heavily on dairy meat or processed food and you ll more likely than not avoid high cholesterol heart problem kidney problem etc My dad had high cholesterol and they prescribed him a statin but his doctor also recommended he adopt a diet based on whole plant food Guess what He took probably 3 pill max and stopped taking them because of how shitty they made him feel He s not a vegan or a vegetarian but by making healthier choice he no longer ha high cholesterol and therefore is le likely to deal with heart attack or atherosclerosis Pills do not fix the issue they simply prevent you from feeling the side effect of what is already going on so if possible always choose to eat healthy or healthier Of course this doesn t apply to people with severe medical issue who really need their medication to be able to function and live at least a decent life free of pain intrusive thought etc
Lokey	Yet no one mention Trump and how his administration is doing such a good job maga trump2020
Hannah Mac	I m on the side of the government on this issue this sound like something that could genuinely benefit people
Geometricsolitude	How bout no commercial it s dirty and a doctor should be the one to recommend new med it s a bullshit system
Cecilia K	Even if this doesn t prompt company to drop their price a much a the government would like more transparency is definitely better I don t agree with many of the move this administration ha made but this is a smart and necessary one
Jessie Green	Coma or death a these may become permanent 🙃
MrsMobs LuvzBooks	I take 7 to 9 prescription drug a day and I normally dont ask for them or care about the price If my doctor think that these med are the best for me then I go with it My insurance will likely deny anything that cost too much
Nicky s	Price MUST BE TRANSPERANT and there should be a limit to the amount of profit a company can make off on drug v the cost to make that drug There need to be expansion to the law that ANY VIDEO AUDIO SLIDESHOW SCROLL BY FLASH PLAYER ADDS all need to include price and that social medium must also advertise price
Oojablah '	I think that if you want drug company to lower price you should publicly publish their drug recipe That would open up opportunity for smaller company and lab to reproduce and even improve upon an expensive drug and offer it at a far lower price point
Highway to Paris, TX	I think at the least it would stir up competition in a way
shiftychaos	The only reason I can afford my life saving medication is because my med are subsidized I absolutely would have died by now if I didn t have them I m already kinda bitter about the pay u or die situation I m in but pharmaceutical company saying pay u MORE or die genuinely piss me off The fact that the Trump admission is taking this on make me respect them at least a little bit which is pretty unusual cause most internet folk would consider me a libtard snowflake But yknow prop where prop are due this is a good move Especially for elderly folk who those ad a typically directed at They often don t have the tech knowledge they need to find cheaper alternative so this transparency will likely make their life a whole lot easier
Kelly LF	I m definitely a fan of the extra video 😊 As far a advertising drug price I think it s a good idea in theory but a mentioned it can get confusing with different insurance coverage I think that they should be made to provide a week s worth of their product because of the side effect Having to pay out up to 60 using that because it s the most i ve paid with my insurance and finding out you can t take it is beyond infuriating I wa given a new medication yesterday that came with a card for a two week trial and I really think that s the way to go At least a week Or provide the dr with enough sample to make it happen
Jeff	an impressive consumer act
Inspire Me	I am definitely hoping for trump administration to win this one Pharma company are mafia
MadMac614	As a pharmacist who ha to deal with drug price and issue with drug company on a daily basis literally I just want want to add that this is an extremely complex topic I don ’ t think we will get anywhere with changing drug price until we deal with how that intersects with insurance policy I definitely agree thing need to change for the benefit of patient but it ’ s certainly not a simple and listing a wholesale acquisition cost on a commercial
Big Chops	i definitely think it s a good idea just so the consumer know the price although i do feel like it s a futuristic dystopia in a sense New Happy Pills only 39 95 you too can be just a happy a this guy swimming for only 3 simple payment or 19 99
Sean Callahan	Pharmaceutical company are inherently evil designed to keep consumer for life It s not in their interest for healthy people
Rukifellth	It s almost a if the medical community us insurance a an excuse to jack up their price to ungodly high amount which in turn ha made insurance an absolute requirement if you want any kind of healthcare like some sort of symbiotic relationship or something
Olivia K	Already paying high premium for insurance but don ’ t get me started on deductible I ’ m young and rarely use my insurance but pay thousand a year for just in case But when I do use it they cover barely any of my med or copays until I pay 3 grand out of pocket Unless I get in a car accident or something crazy I ’ ll never pay my full deductible
Chelsea Carlson	About time
Ricky Zanders	Huh Trump actually did something competent
Dan Cooper	Big Pharma forgot to bribe Big T
Aidan Treder	My thought are that where the pharmacy company get let loose i e lowering price the insurance company will pick up the slack and raise their price or make it more difficult for certain plan people to get prescription medication that they desperately need I think making pharmacy tell you the pricing of their medication is a very good idea that way people know what would go into taking this medication However I think the pharma company will present so much push back that this fails to go through
WolframKKM	I m not sure what it s like in the state but a a pharmacy tech in Canada I have to say the sleezey big wig in the pharmaceutical company aren t wrong that prescription cost are incredibly complicated You have to contend with the fact that every single person ha a different insurance plan which may or may not cover certain drug and will cover different percentage of the price For many it can also depend on deductible if they use up the money before the end of the year on their insurance dose change and a multitude of other random bullshit The majority of people have no idea what the base cost of the drug is by the end of the whole process and could pay very different price for the same prescription at different time of the year But then again health care is also different here so who know what it s like in the US

rainynight02	People need to stop treating drug a though they are the end all be all and switch to actually fixing the cause of the problem instead of just treating the symptom
EmpireSun	This battle is staged The administration already know it ’ s not gon na do anything it ’ s just a puppet show to distract u a they receive a pay underneath from drug lobby
Benjin Van	I ’ m enjoying the graphic Right on Team PhillyD
ljaquos	I mean yes Transparency is a huge thing that I want and for once I m with the Trump administration That felt dirty to type
Boaty McBoatface	Coma or death a these may become permanent Wait wut now Lol
DimensionX Kitty	Just one more reason to love Trump Of course you ll never hear a word of this from the liberal medium
TheIronMoose	How the hell is mandating a public listing of price a first amendment infringement
RavenGlenn	I ve been working in the specialty pharmacy market for the past 3 year I can tell you that a very common question from patient is how much doe this actually cost before insurance And then I d have to tell them that the medication they are getting is around 50 per pill so usually anywhere frome 5 10 thousand a month A good number of those patient would say they do not want the medication then So I think it very well may cause the company to drop price And right now most of them can afford to Most very high priced medication were bought by a pharma company and hiked up for pure profit
cemtexbez	these pharma company c e o are worse than illegal drug dealer like Pablo Escobar more ruthless and money grabbing like that guy who took over a company a few year back making aid med they were like 50 buck till he came in and hiked it up to 500 odds sick heartless sociopath
Justin M	I wonder if the fact that there are more people taking prescription is because oh I don t know the population ha grown since the 80 s Plus you have baby boomer at high age and Gen Xer s are in their high 30 s and 40 s I agree 100 that drug company need to lower price
Potato Penguin	In Ontario my pharmacist ALWAYS push generic medication first Generic medicine helped with my guilt of wasting so much of my parent money tho thankfully now people under 25 i believe can get free prescriptipns barring certain insurance so I don t actaully use any money rn other than 3 00 i can t imagine how diffcult it must be for US citizen being first given name brand that are overpriced
madkatt333	I ’ m glad somebody is trying to make the price more competitive We should be able to shop around like we would at the grocery store for our medicine That will drive down cost
Alyssa Detwiler	Oh oh my god the trump administration is doing something I agree with oh my god oh my god
Holy Aaron	Humira won t be very interesting after they show how much it cost
Joey	Its expensive for u due to price control in other country s We pay for all research and development and country like France can t afford R D due to said control So we pick up where they lack
Angel Henriquez	These bitch just want to keep on their way and trick people If the medicine cost 5 000 then I know my weak as insurance ain t gon na pay for it They should list the pricing and in parenthesis put cost without insurance Then give a link to their website to compare pricing with insurance It s not that fucking hard
craig brower	Side affect may include coma and death which may be permanent 😂😂
Ariella Holstein	I ’ m on med and I think they should be cheaper I get mine free because I ’ m disable but my parent and grandma cost money It should be le than 100 in my opinion
Rachel H	The Ontario government caused the price on generic drug to go down in I believe it wa January this year And now we are experiencing insane shortage it s their way of fighting back I have a feeling that your American drug company will do the exact same thing cause drug shortage
Jeffrey	It s not enough it should be listed in the online and magazine ad a well
Dog Meat	This news is actually a pleasant surprise I ve had to take lithium since i wa a preteen and have been on and off other medication since On multiple occasion complication with insurance meant my family ended up having to pay the absurd full price for the medication that i needed to function and on some occasion to prevent me from dying or becoming seriously ill without being aware of just how much it costed
Amelia B	I wa expecting to hear horrible news upon clicking this video but this something I can really get behind
Stephen Clarke	coma or death a these may become permanent ok thanks for that
Ally	I work in a pharmacy and the price of drug is insane Just yesterday we had a guy pay over 400 for his insulin and that wa with insurance A lot of drug have generic which is great but there are a lot without generic and people have to pay so much money for drug that they need It ’ s crazy
Curtis Dunn	I like the idea of the rule However I don t believe it go far enough For one thing a lot of people consume the advertisement through YouTube Netflix Hulu etc By limiting it to television commercial I believe company will increase the amount of online commercial without price and take advantage of that loophole
Gokiburi	Man America is so weird it s weird that they are even allowed to advertise thing I ll just leave that in the hand of doctor
Faith Sizemore	If it is a drug that you need to live like insulin for diabetic and EpiPens for anaphylactic shock due to an allergic reaction then it shouldn ’ t cost impossible amount to buy
Doom Paul	gasp Trump doing a good
volleyballking95	This is a topic we ’ re discussing in my English class rn
Lisa Richmond	As someone in the UK Scotland this is so weird to me I don t pay anything for my prescription out of pocket I had surgery 2 year ago and have been on medication since then didn t pay anything Even in England the cost of a prescription is £8 80 per item no matter what that item is You can even get prepay certificate if you get more than one prescription which brings the cost down
Cathleen Rivera	I really loved this type of video Please continue to do more You are doing a great service by making this information easily available for people like me who have work and not much time but do care
Daniel Sharps	Imagine if we had a single payer healthcare system where everyone got medication for the same cost
Abrookruss	If medication are different price for different insurance why can t they just make a website where you can put your insurance information in and then give you an estimate Then in their TV ad they will have to promote the website for price check I think most insurance website have a prescription estimator
Evan Helmer	That last commercial at 1 07 lol “ Call your doctor if you experience coma or death a it may be permanent ” No shit Sherlock Love ya Phil
steven schilt	I am on Humera I have only had to pay 32 for my Humera this year however my insurance company ha paid nearly 80 000 for the same drug they advertise Humera like it is this great drug but the side effect are outrageous Humera is the most prescribed drug in the world because it treat so many disease Wood me knowing the true cost of Humera make me le willing to purchase it yeah I had an option Unfortunately I m running out of med that work for what I have And another little side note on this I m on disability insurance That mean taxpayer have paid 80 000 this year alone for my medication We As Americans have got to do something go to bring the cost of medication down if this help at all them by God do it
Dizzy	Coma or Death a this may be permanent Wow we can actually permanently die
Nadsenoj1	On the first story So the billionaire around America are waking up The internet will eventually overtake the main strem medium So putting restriction and clause on the pretentious opus Titans making big advertising budget look closely at alternative Lol
SpentBarn	And why should i care about this I live in a civilized country I am on medication that i need so that my heart doesn t explode and or i kill myself and i pay a max of le than 200 a year and that give me all the medication i need for that year
Filthy Casual	If someone need something they will buy it
James Sengoku	I used to work at a pharmaceutical place and you wouldn t believe the bullshit you will learn about that industry my favourite is the absolutely bullshit job position created by higher ups to simply get more money or for political reason
kevshorty	Here in Canada it s illegal to jack up price of med just because there s only a small percentage that will take it The price are always fixed except only when inflation is factored in each year But it s not much And a an incentive the med are further subsidized to not only make it even cheaper for Canadians to pay for but to provide pharma with a steady cash flow Capitalism is pretty much illegal in government funded job such a school medical and the police However each person is paid comfortably This is all to ensure that even a poor person ha the ability to access these thing and have the opportunity to get out of a rut Because that s where the ultimate problem lie in capitalism Once you re poor it s hard to get out of it America is bad for that
Mana-Ramp-Matoran	Yas This is a huge win for consumer The pharmaceutical and medical industry is running rampant in the US My dad got in a car accident last month he wa knocked unconscious for a few minute But then taken to a county hospital He wa there for three hour and they re trying to charge him 50 000 He also take a prescription medication fo epilepsy He s on a generic now which is affordable but for year he didn t even know one wa available His doctor didn t tell him about it If any other industry tried to pull this shit they d be fined and sued by the fed out of existence I m all for more regulation on these industry and getting these bastard to have to disclose price
Snow	I like how this fraud is still around
J P Taylor	The edit feeeeeeels so different Really like it though x
ithinkimightbelost	i support this because transparency should help consumer become more informed and gov can slap them with major federal fine if they dont comply i think a with car a with financial lending product prescription drug are expensive and pricing is complex for the average person so this may not solve everything but it def wont hurt
Kim Cornell	One other point that they are missing Each pharmacy company have a different price on their med they carry Some or most put a mark up after what they pay for a med Is the pricing that list going to regulate what pharmacy ’ s charge to people with out insurance And what a pharmacy charge an insurance company I think the new regulation have to consider a few others thing and making med equal in all category should be the price that should be set for all
Che Che	So if I die I should call my doctor I think I can manage that
Danyell Hubbs	We Always Love Extra Videos Phil 😊 the more the better
Quinn Van Order	Hey Phil longtime viewer who recently discovered your podcast version of the show I love that feature and would appreciate it if these out of band show were also put in the podcast stream Thanks man
Guillaume Pigeard	What about following social democracy limit the retail pricing of drug on a governmental level forbid direct advertisement Because I don t see how you can come to your doctor and tell him I want the new cool drug I have seen on TV that will probably help with my stomach issue No it won t How do you know I spent 15 year studying medecine Did you Same a I don t go to my car mechanic saying I want to buy a new pair of tyre to fix my dead battery
Em San	the drug thing is super foreign to me I go to my doctor and they choose my medicine because I am not a doctor why would I care what brand it is im from the uk btw
Matt Sierra	The fact we advertise perscription drug is stupid anyways A doctor is the professional that should give the reccommendation a to whether or not I need a perscrition drug and not because I saw an old man walking around with a butterfly on tv and all the sudden I can ask my doctor if I can force him to write me a script to feed big pharma
Aidan Thompson	Love the morning show
ronniegogs	Looks like election are coming closer
dantenotavailable	I think the penalty for not sharing pricing information will be loss of patent exclusivity That ll bring the price down quick smart
Chikiko Saotome	This may be the first to come out of the trump Administration that I fully approve of Though I think all they should always include the price not just on TV ad All ad should have the price and tirtiarily I think If the ad ha audio they should voice it But me important is just listing it in non TV ad especially internet ad on thing like Hulu and YouTube where your still likely to get ad in video but not technically TV These type of medium are Quickly overusing TV so if they are limited to only TV it will be self limiting help
DJ Jones	I feel like this is just another example of people out of touch with where society is making decision Why are we talking about a strictly tv ad I don ’ t know about everyone else but I know I have maybe 1 friend who ha cable Streaming need to be added to the conversation or the whole thing is moot
BLANK MEMES	Speaking of shady dealing in the health industry seems pretty rich coming from you
Xersys	Ban drug ad on television It s your doctor responsibility to prescribe drug
BigFerris L	Trump 2020
Joseph Koch	Hey all Im from New Zealand and while yes we do have ad on TV any time you go to the doctor to get a prescription it s GOVT subsidised so most most drug are set at 5 per item
Hudaef Cares?	Well I dunno in other country but in the Philippines we like to self medicate only going to the hospital the common people don t have doctor if it s really bad Like I can t walk move bad For example I ve never been hospitalised though there had been time where I m pretty sure I broke my foot never got a rabies shot though I ve been bitten by dog twice fever so bad I d puke water etc Huh It just sound like I had a rough childhood
Jim	I thought the problem with prescription drug wa overusage not the high price 😅
Fionn Collender	I like the extra video but the editing make me feel like you think we have ADHD and need to constantly change what s on the screen to keep u interested for me it wa off putting however the content wa interesting even if I m not American
Pretty Ugly	I take an antidepressant so I wonder how this will affect me
XDLadyHydrangea	DId that ad at 1 09 really just say death may become permanent Like well gee bummer I thought you could get rid of that
9lives lie-cat-lie	coma or death or wa coma or deaf
Bryce Forsythe	I see these commercial in Canada and have for year a I haven t watched TV for about 5 year but pretty sure it s American drug on American channel but like Canadians see it and some of the drug are available here Ask your doctor if you need help getting it up and don t mind this mad list of side effect
Kell's Corner	Big pharma we don t want people to know when we are charging 400 23 000 more than the drug actually cost to produce based on region sex nationality ectectect for example 15 dollar Asthma control inhaler costing 45 in France but 600 in America because reason Fuck those company to death
DrummerCayden	There s a great documentary on Netflix called Prescription Thugs I highly recommend you watch it
Jennifer Lucio	There s an app called good rx It tell you the price and find the cheapest place to buy from
MatthewJBD	Is Trump doing a good job
Susan larson	Phil what are your thought on medical marijuana and federal housing Did you know you if you have a medical marijuana card and live in federal housing you ll need to choose between your medicine and your home
Hawkeye117	I have ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis A few month ago I wa prescribed Humira to help treat those thing but due to cost and the side effect I decided not to take them The drug wa well over 100k a year which my family can t afford and while my insurance could ve insured u I m on ObamaCare still due to not being able to work from my condition so I worry I may be dropped at any time Me knowing the price of this drug beforehand would ve been helpful since I could ve told my specialist Hey I can t take this because it cost too much and my insurance may drop me and we could ve found a cheaper Maybe le effective however option
Che Cook	I have never been on medication I avoid going to the hospital I have essentially paid for other s medical expense for 20 year Any effort to reduce cost I am a fan of
Whatever4690	Sounds like a positive move by the Trump administration to tackle corruption in big pharma but who know if it will work
Spencer Graham	Is it just me or wa the editing in this video kind of juvenile Like the visual part I prefer just the plain black bar with text and scrolling photo and company logo no Just me Okay really loved the video though great topic
Stormcrow	coma or death a these may become permanent So your saying there is a chance it may not be permanent YES I M GON NA LIVE FOREVER
Harmless Critter	they have to try and lower them it is stupid how much money the company try to make compared to the cost of development and what people can actually afford This will be super important a more and more biologicals are developed the price can just stay high for no reason or one bold competitor can just say no and make it affordable
The Nate Debate	It used to be illegal for drug company to advertise direct to consumer make it illegal again and problem solved Just like corporate lobbying that used to be illegal a well make it illegal again and we wouldn ’ t have any of these problem
SOULIST89	Makes me wonder if Trump had some beef with a pharma guy way back when or didn t like the money they got and is getting back at them with this considering his normal accommodation for business and the wealthy
Jong Fuu	This seems really weird Doesn t your doctor already know the price It should already be part of the conversation with your doctor
Taraster33	I don t post or respond often But this requirement to list drug price is one of the few thing God help me thatI agree with trump Now I don t know if the drug company have already figured out a workaround to bypass these law but forcing a price number even if they then explain away that most insurance will cover it will stick into most people s mind a a sort of omfg if I lose insurance this is how much I will pay sort of situation
Emily Christine	No newspaper magazine webpage or social medium page required That s how most people are consuming medium today So is it really encouraging being transparent anyway TV is only one kind of ad Consumers see these ad all over the place Shoot I got an ad for diabetes medication on Toy Blast the other day
Guts The Berserker	Big Pharma is quaking in it boot over having to be transparent
SketchbookLP	I am supposed to be on insulin but it cost 675 ever 2 week or 1350 a month and I don t even make that much with the ability to cover electric gas and food or have the qualification to get a job that doe
Tim Clark	Azar At first before seeing his name on Faux News I thought you were talking about a drug Czar and it being surprising at what he wa doing because of that lmao
Ciel	I feel like the most effective way would be to partner with certain company to make the generic offbrand at a fraction of the price If the big company don t want to do it fine But when everyone start buying the generic brand because it s way cheaper and is back by the government I feel like they will change their mind
Janet Dillingham	I have to meet a deductible before my insurance kick in so yes I would love to know how much a drug cost ahead of time and also why the price of drug change from one month to the next
Jerry VanNuys	So ha the trump administration accidentally stumbled into doing something that would actually benefit most Americans Well even a broken clock is right twice a day so I guess anything is possible
Key Wise	Will this adress the long time issue of business upcharging Medical material and service for the sake of making more money through insurance of course itll be hurtfull to have a outrage price in youre add it a good law that might brings pressure to subdue some of the problem we have with price
Feluriel	Your all right trump is probably the worst president ever how dare he force large farma company to be transperent what a horrible president shame shame shame
F35Lighting2JSF	I had a relative who had a child with a very rare genetic disease he wa on a whole slew of medication one of thesis cost 126 000 a month They would get a new bottle of the stuff every month all I can say is thank God they have good insurance
WeLikeSportz	Advertising is against the law in Australia but the major problem is the pharma company are in bed with the doctor who only prescribe brand name drug which could be purchased alternatively for half the price if you were allowed Seems like a step in the right direction for America but I m skeptical of the motivation Wherever there s a lot of money there will be corruption
SportTalkForDummies	I ’ m in Canada and we pay a small fraction of the actual cost also if you ’ re disabled or low income they ’ re free Takes a massive weight off of a disabled person who is limited in work or can ’ t work at all but can still get the med they desperately need Low income parent don ’ t have to worry about whether they can afford their sick child ’ s prescription or grocery Canada ’ s pretty dope
SvedigeMeatBox	seriously how can you call you a news organization and do not even make the most simple background check of betterhelp it pathetic even pewdiepie and the killstream discovered it wa a huge scam i have watched your video for many year but your credibility is reminiscent of cnn to be honest
Matt Sumney	I don ’ t like trump but I ’ m well ok with this drug thing being pushed by his administration
FireIvory	
Hoigwai	Clarity and honesty thing we have not seen from the pharmaceutical industry ever in it existence
RandomGeekNamedBrent	or death a these may become permanent you think
The reality you fear	Wait Trump is for this WTF I hate this now We need to allow bigPharma to not disclose info and sell at high price
Kayli Dunk	I am quite shocked trump is doing anything that would effect his country s profit this greatly this make me think there is something else going on that we don t know about that he is gaining from this maybe I hope this make the drug industry lower their price but a so many people need these drug to live anyways the big guy kind of have the upper hand
PandaMan	Doctors push unnecessary drug
MrJnoble85	I love your face I don t even watch the news no more Just philip He tell me the thing I want to hear
Luis Guillermo Contreras Flores	Thanks trump
E&J Family	Coma or death a this may become permanent No shit
Vincent Molina	I feel like some very important support system for just regular people are very broken in the US Obviously it s never all sunshine and rainbow anywhere but Healthcare shouldn t bankrupt people
KINADOE doe	Can t see comment
VanillaCupk	This is some cyberpunk shit
Some People	This didn ’ t appear in my recommended feed 😢
bob ert	1 08 well fuck who knew death wa permanent
Sparky	Coma or death a these may be permanent No really I wa only aware of the temporary form of death
ZenakuShinobi	wow trump admin doing the people a solid
v2lab	70 of american take a prescription drug but people actively fight against healthcare for all lol okay
Kyle Latebeer	Super interesting story Phil thanks for sharing
Aidan S	I think this is an incredible move for consumer Did not expect something like this to come from the Trump administration or such a PhRMA favorable Azar but sometimes it fun to be surprised
Brandi Munguia	I currently have 13 prescription medication I take daily and 4 I take a needed The one I ’ m worried about the most are my pain med because of the change in pain prescription staring in January only allowing me two week of med at first and then it ha to be shown that I need to continue them on a regular basis
nonya bizness	I m very surprised this is coming from the Trump admin but fuck it I m entirely on board Evem if these company keep up their ridiculous price at least people will know what they re getting themselves into It s always better to have more informed consumer
Simon Sozzi	Coma or death a these can become permanent
Emily Kohl	Why just limit it to TV commercial and no other form of advertising I can count the people I know that still pay for cable television on one hand
HelloSerg	This will never work lol
Zaoying	It s a company not a person so why doe s the first amendment come in to affect
leafben26	I have Tricare through the military which mean I don ’ t pay for my prescription however I agree with this I think everyone should know the price of the drug they are asking for Once you get in the doctor office it ’ s hard to think of all the question to ask about your health let alone worry about making the decision about an expensive medicine
Flam Flam	I live in NZ and it s quite rare to see pharmaceutical commercial That s just my experience anyway
beth 9891	The pharmaceutical industry need major overhaul Incredibly corrupt and inflated cost While it s horrible in any industry when this happens it s particularly disgusting when the product is something people often need to survive
HauntedShadowsLegacy	I m on guanfacine for ADHD I d certainly be curious to know the price of it For the whole it s hard to tell the real price in an ad because of insurance argument from PHRMA just list more than one price Without insurance would be the initial price and with compatible insurance would be the estimated final price with a side note that you can check to see your insurance s compatibility on their website Seems like a good compromise to me I wan na know what this medicine that I take to function at least semi normally cost I dunno about you but I feel like I should know that Side note while we re in the process of forcing medical establishment to tell people what they pay can we get hospital to display their chargemasters Pretty please
InsolubleToaster	So the price that BigChainPharmacyW pay for Lyrica is say 400 for 90 capsule Across the street at BigChainPharmacyC however they pay 350 for 90 capsule It s not the drug company that make that price different it s that the two pharmacy use different supplier for their drug So would the price in the commercial be an MSRP like car Will they work around it like they do with the coupon they offer and say a low a xx xx with some insurance instead of actually giving a concrete number WITHOUT insurance Doesn t have to be read aloud because blind people don t need medication right
Andy Ford	What a softball tv only in the cable cutting age Bull Not enough Not nearly enough Of course big pharma is squawking about it but should this even pas will do little If anything big pharma will raise price
Kathryn Nims	Yes please have the company show their price Especially for those mood stabilizer Man those thing are stupid expensive Couple grand a month without insurance
Aaron Frawley	In nz it relegated to late night infomercial
Sergio Halaby	I cant wait to hear how the Left will be against this and make sure to bring in racism and gender inequality into this
Thomas Barton	First dont make insurance mandatory Second make insurance company pay full price for a product
Jessica Squier	It take ten year for a drug to go generic That s how long their patent last which mean little to no competition and for many of them there is no generic available Working in retail pharmacy I can tell you most pharmacy will default to filling with generic unless your prescribed wrote otherwise We will also order what we can in that is often dependant on our wholesaler so if you want a specific brand you can better afford you may need to go to another pharmacy I support this legislation but I foresee issue regarding what insurance will and will not cover If you do shop around and that pharmacy isn t covered in your rx billing then you re going to pay out of pocket anyway and it might just be cheaper to stay with what you have This issue is on insurance company too
Wolveskrieg Feuersturm	I am not a fan of Trump however this is a move that is one I am in full agreement with Hopefully this will eventually reach beyond simply the T V onto other marketing platform I am fortunate to have a top tier prescription plan however I am quite well aware of the massive cost behind anything relating to mental or medical help health
MoonFairy929	Watched this twice Seems that the proposal is a false flag to follow a campaign promise but is toothless and pointless Just for show Pricing doe vary depending on insurance so unless we had a single payer system the posted info is meaningless Telling people pricing doesn ’ t make anything more accessible for those in need Shaming company for pricing doesn ’ t work in a culture that insists on “ free market ” deregulation Ugh Just more noise
Josh	It s Earlyfranco
ViolentOrchid	Only old people and square watch TV
Adamurquhart	The only result I care about is insulin bloody dropping in cost I use the three trash Walmart type to guarantee I only have one hospitalization a year and 4 5 DKA event in that time but time is running out Also drug that have no generic version most certainly do NOT have to reduce pricing Hell manufacturer of generic type could just raise their price to flip off the government due to transparency law Plus all pharmaceutical manufacturer and supply could just price drug outside the range of coverage so insurance company would just strike them off covered list due to too drastic an increase in premium in competitive market US Citizens for the most part do not comprehend the stranglehold the entire scope of the medical field ha on our politician and especially on our life Constantly pointing to random cost increase in AIDS medication or the epi pen debacle isn t even 1 of the shenanigan these asshats pull Good luck government May some invisible sky man have mercy on your blackened soul
kevfoda	I think you didn t do your research properly I have seen those kind of ad everywhere I have lived in England New Zealand Brazil and currently been living in Australia and they always show up on the TV It clearly isn t only in New Zealand and the US
Juil	It s hilarious that big pharma s excuse is that people have different insurance policy All the more reason for everyone to know the cost upfront
Plague Influence	I d love to see more video like this even if it s not particularly tied to current news Getting hit with some knowledge on a topic that isn t spoken about very often is really refreshing
Swingading16	Interesting I think these proposal are a great idea but it is also true that different insurance plan make it hard to convey how much a drug will cost each individual
Qc.Wtf	In Canada you can still see Cialis and not anymore see patent Viagra ad on TV Those two are prescription drug here in Canada
mad honeybee	side effect may include Coma death which may become permanent Do ya think we are so Fubared
Micheal Bomberger	Death may become permanent lol
Steve Black	How will leftist swing this to make it look like Trump is Hitler
kevin Rudd	Glad I live in Australia
Melinda	I hate and I do mean hate the medical field and the rx battle Now day every medication need a prior auth for the medication Oh you need to try these 10 medication before you can try this one that your provider is recommending even though my Dr know more about my personal health than my insurance So ridiculous
MsChauser	In Finland the pharmasists are legally required to also offer you the cheapest drug that ha the same effect a the one your doctor prescribed Obviously this mean every drug ha to be thoroughly tested and put in a database a no human being could possibly remember every type of medicine there is I find however that this is a good system that push the price down Only work really well with the more common drug I pay roughly 12€ per year for my depression drug whilst my SO pay 80€ per month to treat his ulcerous colitis
NaTeesha85	I m just so done with American capitalism and Big Pharma It s literally an industry Some suggest that there s a cancer industry because of the ton of treatment and medication that the thousand of cancer patient need Not saying that I argue this a true but I dont find it far fetched in present American capitalist society
Evan Alexander	Wow this is a first ok here go Yay Trump I agree with your administration
Ahmadgazzy	niggatoid
Glenn Paton	I like that after the selling point in the ad they spend a heap of time telling you all the possible side effect then end with in some case may result in death
Matthew Corbett	This video did not show up in my notification at all but the normal show did Just a FYI Anywho a a Diabetic who buy insulin hell yeah make them be transparent
Chelsea	Require them to disclose the profit margin instead
pinkfuzzyflipflops	Hell yeah morning vid
A Random Guy	These singled out subject are great More focus on one important thing le chance of having lost and confounded with other one
Cameron Peterson	I m just glad something is being done
Tchristina J	Don ’ t think it ’ s going to make a difference with drug company lowering their price but kudos to Trump for trying
HannahKateBell	As a type one diabetic whose life depends on insulin the fact that enough insulin to last me a month could cost 2 500 next year is terrifying I could die Insulin is my life support It never leaf my mind that I could die at the age of 20 Fun fact one vial of insulin cost 5 to make
GonzoBlue	Just remembered death may be permanent
3rdHalf	This is such a non issue that pretend to solve “ the problem ” Just ban prescription drug ad
Twitter: @_Nathan_Gibson_	Funny My debate topic is about price control on pharmaceutical
THE 301 CHAMP	Philly D Great a always I think people need to look at this a a plus Liberals NEED to acknowledge this is something that will improve their life Society is becoming more and more and more polarized politically every day People need to start to feel like the world isn t going to end Trump did something good We should all be thankful and embrace a bit of positivity for a change
MrPingn	All they have to do is list the primary price based on their manufacturing packaging and what not Then say price may vary based on insurance and other variable It s a no brainer They are just trying to cover their butt Drug company are a third of the problem with the opioid crisis The other two third are of course crappy doctor and personal misuse
TheBluEye Prince	MAOR
Snorlaxation	Yes Phil I m very surprised that the trump administration is attempting to provide u with a surprisingly decent or even good bit of legislation something that might help the general public for good logical reason Took almost halfway through his presidency but better late than never
Nick	100 for transparency
Bri	in new zealand our ad arent nearly a frequent or bad a the American one I ve seen but dear god they re so ominous
Kacy's Kastle	Doesn t it get exhausting hearing phrma company lobbyist argue why price transparency is a bad thing Can one person tell me the cost of a drug service they ve recently received Of course not And that s so the phrma company can keep price offensively high and justify it by saying insurance usually pay so who care No where else in the world doe a company sell something to you and then list the price later Then argue it s bad to have to tell you the price in advance
Darlene Lesmana	Comma or death these may become permanent Boy
Silver Fox	where s the link to the government comment page for this you mention it but don t provide it TV is dead they need to implement this requirement on social medium ad a well
D J	This is just going to help normalize the outrageous over pricing of the drug it remove the sticker shock
John Kendall	Bring required to display cost of a product is against free speech I m no federal judge but I would hope that amendment doesn t protect withholding relevant information from consumer Also I just generally tend not to trust any drug that s advertised in a commercial
WakeforFakeCake	I m all for it but a better law would be for any medical company to keep their price fair based on the price instead of raising the price for insurance company Those who can t afford insurance can t afford treatment but it s still necessary
Devon Lee	Really enjoyed the layout and overlay of clip relevant to the discussion overtop Phil s comment Great video format and content 👍
ela goon	Omg Trumpipoo is trying to do something good what is happeningggg
Kate Phillips	Love the single topic morning format Phil Also glad Solutions to the high price of drug are being discussed
Arsalan	I don t like the stockimages video in the background of the clip and the animation It take away from the straight to the fact aspect I like about the PDS \
davidixonlive	Finally a great idea from the administration
Iron Druid	I m in disbelief over 70 of Americans being on prescription drug Phill mentioned those long list of side effect in commercial but tbh that s all I ve ever paid attention to when they come on TV
Shayna Myhill	This by far is the most positive thing this administration ha done In what world am I supposed to feel bad for drug company that essentially want u to be a sick a possible for monitory gain In general prescription drug shouldn t be advertised to the public because uh we re not doctor and it s a doctor job to diagnose me The entire concept of advertising medicine is corrupt and drug company SHOULD feel a need to have competitive price because health should be a right and not a privilege and most importantly available to all This isn t a perfect solution but thank god the injustice surrounding the FDA is being addressed The American health care system is a disgrace to developed country

bensemus x	I don ’ t see how it could make them more expensive Transparency is always a good thing
untitled 01	Just kill the Prescription ad Do what litterally everyone else ha done
Business Outside The Lines - w/Chuck Peavey	I m betting this is the first step of many to create transparency in the medical industry The problem is people in general got used to insurance company paying for something Since we didn t know what they actually cost we didn t worry Then under Obamacare it became mandatory The hospital and drug company raised their price the insurance company came after the government to subsidize the insurance more Ultimately the price for everything went up people just didn t know In 1997 I paid cash for hernia surgery All inclusive it wa around 2K In 2010 same surgery other side same doctor cash price 11K With insurance negotiated a price 4K How doe an insurance company get a 7 000 brake on the price Well the hospital setting the cash price that high ensures I need insurance and can t afford to pay cash The Insurance company paying that much more than the previous surgery mean the hospital make money The only people hurt Consumers and taxpayer
Traplover7	Transparency is always good and this is a surprisingly good bipartisan plan
J M	Ironic that the company and middle men are complaining about insurance company won t cover the cost of drug It s almost a if a private for profit insurance system doesn t work like it s suppose it
Lynkah	My Theory on Trump and this actually potentially Humanist decision is it s just trump doing what he always doe going with the number to try and get an advantage He could not care le about the positive impact it will have simply that it will impact people voting the way he want If he wa sure he would make out like a bandit without this being announced he d never in a million year consider it He s a selfish man only after strengthening the entitled rich white side of the chess board
AllegorX FPV	That EVIL Trump administration is AT IT AGAIN oh wait weird
Crown Clown	Me and my dad LOVE laughing at drug commercial when the side effect come on
joomyjoo	Im a medical doctor in korea Pricing of drug is a difficult matter because it nothing like other consumer product This is because the buyer and the consumer are different Whereas you could buy a car and also use it the doctor buy prescibes the drug for the patient who then consumes it That said the economics are different in different country In the state I believe the pharma can pay insurance company which in turn join hand with hospital and the benificiaries of the lobbying becomes the whole medical industry In Korea we have univeral coverage by the government and because the primary buyer of drug are the insurance provider the government they have dominant control over the pricing of drug Gov can say thats too expensive bring the price down or we re not going to cover it or even worse not allow it in the market This doe happen and sometimes lead to drug or medical product not being available That said I think the trump admin s move to clarify cost in pharma ad is 100 the right move The propsed uncertainty of differing insurance coverage can be clarifies by adding Consult your insurance agent for the coverage and out of pocket expense in getting name of drug at your clinic
Rachel Sherman	Hey guy I work in a pharmacy a a tech and I have personally seen what high price can do to a person or family I ’ ve come across something really great that can help with your cost if you need it if you ’ re without insurance or if they don ’ t cover enough GoodRx is an app that I have on my phone that i use to help patient who don ’ t have insurance All you do is search for the drug strength and quantity and it search for be lowest priced pharmacy in your area So many of my regular patient have benefited from this and relief they feel when they see that don ’ t have to pay hundred for something they need it ’ s amazing Consider it if you need help ❤️
runforitrun	You need a prescription for these drug why are they advertised on TV We are one of two country where this is legal How doe any of this make sense
Gamezob	Why is this on the morning show Does this stuff get you demonetised
Melissa	We need this in all form of healthcare It s fucking ridiculous when you go in for medical treatment nobody can tell you how much it going to cost Believe me I have asked and I never get a real answer Then they expect you to magically be able to come up with whatever amount they decided to charge within 90 day It s ludicrous
salisranna	Regarding the ad in New Zealand I live here At first I wa confused because they are nothing nothing like the Ads in the USA We do have some not many and only for a few medication most are for like Viagra and Cialis lol but the rest are I m guessing if this is the same promoted ad about over the counter medication They don t go into all the side effect I don t watch tv but when I have that s all I see vastly different to when I ve been in the USA and it every medication possible And the ad could be a full minute long
Parmesana	I refuse to be nothing but a walking pill bottle like most are by the time they reach MY age 61 I take 2 pill and think that I basically only need the one Big Pharm ha a death grip on the healthcare system of this country Reimbursements all over the place IF Trump doe some sort of deal with other country for lower costing med what is the quality control in those other country and then that is outsourcing again thus more Americans without job or not don t know
The Judge	Ok I don ’ t see how this isn ’ t a complete waste of time and tax dollar to pursue this Alerting people to the cost of a drug accomplishes NOTHING Visibly seeing the price doesn ’ t make it any more or le than what it cost yesterday It doesn ’ t change how or if your insurance cover it It doesn ’ t change whether it ’ s the right med for you from before Doesn ’ t change the science of how it will work Doesn ’ t change whether your doctor will agree to prescribe it though it will change whether you mention it to him You might see the price and falsely think you can ’ t afford it when after insurance you can You might think it ’ s cheaper only to find out insurance doesn ’ t cover it at all Those financially struggling might avoid a medication because they falsely think it ’ s too expensive Being told the price doe not change the price anymore than being told it ’ s raining change if it is But having the government negotiate prescription price doe open the door to ONE BIG THING The opportunity for bribe and gift to effect that negotiation Politicians are just looking for a new opportunity for their endorsement to be desired and bought

godwings101	So instead of actually doing something to help the Trump Admin is going to pretend they did something and the ignorant people who don t look into anything but just go by the headline will eat right into this

TheGentleBeast	As an American living abroad more PhillyD news show mean more news I get caught up on that I would likely otherwise miss I feel like there s a huge BUT to this story I m not a fan of the current administration at all and an altruistic move that doe nothing but benefit the average American seems suspect
Tea Burn	Wait wait wait those drug ad are advertising permanent coma or death with a smile and happy music 😃🎶😃🎶😃🎶 but a potential side effect I thought those side effect were the primary selling point because those certainly appealed to me
Dallas Mann	If something cost more out of pocket than the insurance company pay there s kind of a problem and if the insurance company demand more than the out of pocket again big fuckin red flag
WolfvineGaming	Overall it sound pretty good
CyFr's Corner	Really shouldn t be advertising any drug to consumer cocaine heroin marijuana Viagra opoids anything But then I m Canadian and I can go to whichever doctor is available the one at any hospital emergency the medical clinic my family doctor My visit are all paid for by the government through tax My doctor went to school to learn about or at least the basic medical prescription I didn t take anything outside high school for chemical science

Sacred Thyme	thanx
Tyler Kruit	This is a very relevant and interesting topic for me because many in my family take prescription drug medicine and I have pondered for year a to the risk v benefit of this I personally have developed an anti Pharma viewpoint in the last few year prior I am not an open supporter of Trump but under his admin I do agree with this current proposal of change and regulation through pharmaceutical company and hope to see good change because of it I wa not aware the US wa one of few state to allow open advertising for pharmaceutical that wa an interesting fact to learn so thanks Mr Philly D
Tincker	This is a good start
Kurt Flint	I love the extra show I hope this continues past this week I will definitely be watching everyday show
Hypnotist 24	wait death is permanent
R134eS2o	Tell me Phil Even though I don ’ t have health insurance
CelebratingPi	As someone who take a Rx daily I actually love this idea I have had different insurance over the year in different state and through various employer I always knew generic wa more cost effective to name brand but wa never really clear on the exact price until I had no health insurance at all Prices vary store to store not even just insured to uninsured I would love to be more informed and also hash out with my doctor on why they re recommending x and y rather than just asking if the generic version is a effective
josski32	one time i read a post online from a non american saying how weird it wa that we allow drug company to advertise drug she said “ your doctor tell YOU what to take you don ’ t tell your doctor ” and that ’ s basically my thought on this
Jimmy P	I believe there people pettling snake oil and that why people dout vaccine But the same pro vaccine doctor also peddle snake oil in the sense they get paid to push drug that they may not like or know real and better alternative Examples diet and exercise can cure alot not all medical condition I personally don t trust doctor because you don t know if they have your best interest at heart It hard to find a good one Thankfully my dad doe His doctor even apologized for proscribing him sleep med to help him sleep After he realized how bad they were his doctor got fired from the office he work at because he would not push there med on his pateints My doctor proscribed me medication for bell palsy that could have given me diabetes And the kicker bell palsy go away on it own most of the time And after a year or so it wa gone But after 2 month i had trained myself to the point you could not tell one side of my face nerve did not work properly
Paul Bartel	I ’ m actually feeling a little proud that I ’ m not part of that 7 out of 10 number
liquidSpin	Pharma could give the retail cost before insurance cost Simple Said drug is 100 then the potential buyer call health insurance and find out it s covered and ha a copay of
KnowThyself	What they need to do is let ALL medication to be covered through ALL insurance Not nip pick Oml
Veronika Reynolds	“ Coma or death which may become permanent ” Well no shit death is permanent🤦‍♀️
Crazelord91	Obviously the drug company don t want it displayed on TV but are voluntarily adding it to their website their main demographic senior citizen still watch TV and doesn t use the internet much
Donald Cole	No the price will not come down If you need medication to live then there is no chance even if you know what it cost that you will not buy it The reason drug price are so crazy isn t because of ad It is because big pharma raise drug price on drug that people have to have to live In those case of course the person will pay anything to stay alive thus big pharma can charge what ever they want If you really want to affect how much drug cost you have to start talking about price fixing the drug market or a similar system I do not know what it should be specifically but the US is the the only 1st world country that pay this much for drug Every other country set the price for the drug it might be that they can do this because they have some form of national healthcare Which would make it easier for the government to regulate drug price
hgam	By allowing to show price of competitor large company might kill small firm by lowering price which is good if they want to set up a standard I remember one case For interstate bus market there were a group of people killing their competitor by a lower price After they controlled the market they then rise the price a well a gave worse service which caused problem I think there should be more government oversight on this
Vannyvann	If it ’ s something someone want they will pay whatever it take to get doesn ’ t matter if it go higher or lower
Kaitlyn Peterson	After almost 2 year of hating the Trump administration I don t know how to feel about this It seems like a good thing but I m waiting for the punchline
capnthepeafarmer	More knowledge doesn t hurt If anything the price may not get lower but it would allow people to not patronize high cost drug and lower the revenue of company who sell drug at high price
Lan Friesen	Death may become permanent 😆
Josh Sheets	I love your morning show I need to start checking YouTube before work because for some reason I ’ m not getting notification for every video you post like I ’ d like
Abigail Leigh	I ve worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 13 year and a a pharmacist I feel we should get rid of direct to consumer advertising It doe nothing but cause confusion hysteria patient trying to play doctor and increase in drug price I also think it lead to many people thinking they have a disease disorder etc that they don t have Another thing that many people don t realize is that you can shop around for your medication Pharmacies do not all charge the same price especially for generic medication You shop around before buying a car or a TV and should do the same for your prescription medication especially those that don t have insurance have high deductible or catastrophic plan or those with Medicare part D where you have to worry about going into the donut hole Most of the common pharmcies CVS Walgreens Rite Aid mark up their medication the most I will say that the part that people don t realize is how expensive it is to get a drug to the market Out of every 5 000 drug developed only 5 make it to human trial and out of those 5 only 1 make it to the market It take lot money to develop and get a drug approved and pharmaceutical company have to recoup that money just like any business Yes there are lot of shady thing that go on and even a a pharmacist I encourage people to do other thing like lifestyle change instead of having to be put on medication but sadly most Americans don t want to have to do that and are looking for a magic pill Until that change I ll always have job security
Errol Randolph	Probably will impact pricing I remember the epipen price hike that became a PR nightmare Also pricing will influence insurance company to insure only cheaper brand only Hopefully lowering the cost for both the consumer in their insurance plan and out of pocket and the insurer But trickle down doe not always work and insurance plan pricing may remain the same
Ghostus Coyote	Drugs are bad
lucidwind	Thanks for this Good topic
Derrick Gibson	I am not American so I have to ask in all honesty not trolling how are corporation protected by the First Amendment I thought those were right for citizen ie people Again not American so I have never sat in your civics class to understand this

Fiarlia	I don t care how it happens I want prescription drug to be cheaper I m disabled and I m fucking broke because of it A decent amount of friend and family don t understand that I need those med to feel average With all the ad for med everywhere they re smart enough to know that a lot of it is bullshit But then they apply that bullshit to me And I can t walk without a cane and desperately wish I had a wheelchair on some day of the week I d feel more comfortable asking for an Oculus Rift HTC Vive than I would be asking for help on pain med from my family And for the record I refuse to take pain med that are hallucinogenic hallucinatory or anything that get you high I know some people need that level but I don t just basic level pain killer is good for me The fact that I d feel more comfortable asking for a VR device than med is a clear indication that something is wrong whether it s the price the attitude of prescription med or even tangentially related to the stigma of needing script to just function a a person I m not okay but more importantly prescription aren t okay
jassLmhn	wow the Trump administration doing something actually good that s refreshing
noebody878	I ve worked in the speciality pharmacy industry for many year and this is the most stupidest approach they could have come up with for drug price Most of my patient already have the drug process broken down to them by their md office but that is only the manufacturer rate for the medication not what the patient pay out of pocket 90 of our drug are covered through their insurance with a patient only paying 5 out of pocket Also a lot of the drug manufacturer have co pay card and fdp a well for their medication so the manufacturer will pay for the patient out of pocket cost This is just dumb
Ryan	Why is the audio so bad
Trevor Grover	MEDICARE FOR ALL
Zeebedee101	Enjoy your bi yearly Trump doing something productive I mean productive
Wendy Sherbert	They are only doing this because the government want to reduce Medicare and Medicaid benefit put back in the exclusion of preexisting condition in medical treatment So they try and pressure the pharmacy people to lower there price so they look clean but are not Healthcare is a human right AND big pharma need to lower price and stop advertising
Celina K	Have they grown heart Shame Mirror neuron Late PR The world ending
Ghuli	Oof I take 6 different prescription and my sister take 14 so this help
Your Mom	Hello hello welcome to the morning show
MrSubejio	There s a simple solution to this fight that the pharma company aren t going to take Try RandomNameitol costing PRICE or le or even free with insurance or medicaid It would be a necessary step to force company to advertise the price of their medication and it s always been a frustration that it hasn t happened I m glad the Trump administration is pushing for this and I hope it get through I look forward to pharma whining about the same restriction being put on them a have been put on almost every other industry
Trish Cassel	I m Canadian and I m always recommended the generic version of drug cause it s cheaper Never had an issue and never had to pay to much out of pocket Though I believe there shouldn t be brand named drug
Ridgerunner21	Will it lower their price Probably not But knowing the raw price pre coverage I think will let people make a better decision on whether or not they want the treatment offered
J Coll	If the govt really want to lower drug price reduce the time that pharma company can hold the patent on drug Once generic come out the pharma cut the cost of drug to stay in the market
Jamie	What ’ s messed up is my vyvanse is almost 300 without insurance and my insulin is 200 400 a vial without insurance I know many type 1 diabetic who can not afford to obtain insulin due to them not having insurance We literally need insulin to survive so the fact that people can not afford insulin is terrible It ’ s ironic too because the person who discovered artificial insulin wanted it to be cheap if not free because it is literally needed for people to live The Pharmaceutical company are greedy and do not care how the price of drug impact someone ’ s life They need to start being regulated about their pricing
stripe1000	Meh Too little too late All product should be required to clearly present the retail list price without considering outside payee or discount on all advertising Of course all food product should have to list all the ingredient in a clearly understandable fashion a well but they don t I can not count the time we have purchased something that just listed spice in the ingredient to find out that one of those is sage which my mother is allergic to Never fun As for pricing who care how much your insurance will cover that is between you and your insurance company not the pharmaceutical manufacturer They just need to list the standard retail price it is up to the consumer to understand his or her insurance contract or at the very least consult with their insurance company to find out what their out of pocket will be That doe not need to be on the ad just the retail price If your local Ford dealership want to run a sale the manufacturer doesn t have to change all his ad to show the sale pricing in your area what a silly argument
John Baldwin	I am mister “ America is can be best ” but in this area I would actually point out that Europe handle this well They just flat out disallow tobacco and medication advertisement We have a problem with food and medication in this country
Icenineiv	They shouldn t even be advertised period we re the only western country that even allows that practice But if they get to advertise than I m more than happy to see them have to disclose their ridiculous price when they do
Zei33	Prescription use is going up Well yeah that s no surprise It s mainly because we re more aware of problem nowadays and know how to treat it
Nerfenstein aka GirlyGamer	Whenever I visit the US I m always captivated horrified by the sheer amount of drug advert on TV WTF
Nightengale64	I have a couple of chronic illness MCAD and POTS A couple of my med I have to get from Canada because they have not been approved by the FDA Another one of my med is so rare that if I am going to the ER I make sure to have a several day supply because the hospital just doesn t have it I would love for the government to stand up to drug company and have a single payer plan for most drug That would bring down the price significantly We also need better label on what is also in drug I have allergic reaction to different brand and lot number because they all use some different plant starch a a binder Often this isn t even on the medication I am allergic to the coating of some pill to the point that they pas through whole Most of the drug company are making drug that college came up with yet they say the price is high because they need to pay for research when they often didn t pay for it in the first place I am a strong believer that some thing should not be for profit Hospitals healthcare health insurance prison and school should not be for profit entity It creates market for thing that are inhumane Should the public pay for cosmetic only procedure No but there can be a separate market for that
Mike429	i love more content
aemidaniels	The designated area of an advertisement to list all the potential side effect is already so long that they have about 5 second to say the name of the drug and what it for before bombarding you with the side effect If they also add in the price and how that price could change with your insurance something that already take up whole page online they won t have time for anything else In the end you ll end up with a black screen with a white number on it need to be high contrast very visible and taking up a sizeable percentage of the ad and a person auctioneer style rapid firing off the name the price the insurance information the side effect all in under 30 second leaving everyone wondering wtf just happened
Lacey Long	And I clicked on this video thinking it would actually affect me Drug price Canadian we have fair law no advertisement for drug and most insurance company pushing for GENERIC Brands Maybe le a lot le USA Specific video
Lady D	A few week ago my pharmacy thought my wife said we were gon na use insurance which is actually just a set aside account from work comp settlement to pay for one of my med and consequently attempted to increase the cost literally more than 10x It cost just under 130 00 out of pocket and over 1 300 00 when they thought it wa gon na go through my insurance WTF Shit like that is one of the reason our healthcare is so outrageously expensive
shiverme timbers	Don t do drug kid
PewPewLazehs	I would much rather we follow suit of the majority of other country and not even allow them to advertise on tv
gramps2matt	It s all BS when you consider that Trump is on board with bill Ryan and McConnel want to enact that would end Social Security Medicare and Medicaid What good doe knowing the cost of a med do you when you can t afford to see a doctor in the first place
Kenya Leverett	Hello hello Where s my intro Phil I don t like change
kittygurl212	If insurance company are afraid of confusion all they need to do is disclose that the price is what someone would pay without insurance covering it Then someone can go and check to see if their insurance cover that drug and how much I never thought this government would do something I actually approved of but I kind of approve of this I d rather find out the cost sans insurance earlier than the pharmacy counter when I pick it up
Spoonclankencuppen999	Stop ruining the narrative Orange man bad
Kev	lol they might not be aware of a drug they need maybe just maybe that s what doctor are for how about that
HRC106	If someone is in a much control of their destiny a is big pharma then they should be transparent and more helpful with the general public in whatever way they can
Luis OBGYN	Mucho bueno Señior Presidente
Ozzy Thrash	this wasn t researched very well
Phil Collins	While I like the idea I don t think there will be a major shift in drug price mostly because if people want to live and they do and they need a particular medication that likely isn t advertised anyway because it s very nice chance are good they ll buy it regardless of how much it cost We do like living after all
hydralisk102	Tf Selling something Put a price on it clear a day Simple
markysharky03	which is why I don t use drug drug are bad
missmaddie	There ’ s a really easy way to create competition for Big Pharma legalizing marijuana Just sayin
Jordan Brooks	It would be amazing if consumer knew the actual cost of medication and or medical procedure People have gotten so warped in their thinking about medical cost Pharma surely doesn t want consumer to begin considering the actual price
Kay Duff	I support this
Vegashane	All the drug company are are part of one organization and mostly owned all by the same people company so the boosting competition is bullshit and they ’ ll likely act like they lowered price on the ad but really they ’ ll have the government pay more money to drug company to make it seem like it ’ s lowering out of pocket cost Also when ever the government get involved either it ’ s bad or good for a short time then worst then bad all of a sudden without preparation so this blueprint is bogus this is interesting this isn ’ t accountability btw this is some manipulation 101 they are trying to convince the public to support trump by making rule like this that look like they ’ re good but when you take a dive into the truth they aren ’ t at all🤔
Zelous	Wait something good under Trump happening
Some Astrophysicist	I like the new animation
BrutesMcGee	What in the fuck did this have to do with me going to the pharmacy today and not being able to get the brand of prescription medication that work for me Insurance just decided what work for me Im fuckin pissed Phil didn t mention that at all but that s exactly what happened to me today and I ve been prescribed that medication for over 2 year I have to educate myself on this new bullshit I ll be calling the my health insurance tomorrow that s for sure Squeaky wheel get the grease
Diana Shepherd	I see this a being a possibly effective way to make insurance cost go down It ’ s at least a first step Anything we can do to make the insurance company have to compete for our business in any way will bring cost down
Daniel Wolf	Hospitals and the like should also disclose the price of medical procedure up front Trying to get a nurse or doctor to tell you what something they are suggesting will cost is ridiculously difficult sometimes Obviously just like with drug the actual price will vary depending on insurance but you should at least be able to get that list price easily
Games & More!	Placing anyone be it a company or a person on a naughty list is incrediblenly stupid Oh no if we show consumer the base price of a drug we ll get a lump of coal for Christmas and we can t have that
BiggieYT	In my opinion this wont help anything No one watch TV anymore anyways so the advertiser will just come to Youtube and Twitch to circumvent the law
FigJam	Huh I ve never seen an ad on TV for prescription drug and I m a Kiwi Admittedly I haven t watched actual TV in many year now but I watched a LOT most of my life and I don t remember seeing any Could just be my memory though
br0wnb0y	udemy ad before this excellent bonus video Keep it up Philip DeFranco
Josh May	Good this is a start but I think they should go further Any medical professional should be required to give you a price estimate before they ever touch you unless it is a life or death situation I had some serious strep throat last year and since I had never had it I had no idea what it wa My ear were aching a lot a well a the obvious throat pain So when I told the doctor about my ear they had a nurse come in and spray my ear out with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water They then charged me 90 for that 90 are you freaking kidding me For some hydrogen peroxide and water If I known how much it would cost for them to remove some harmless ear wax I wouldn t have ever let them do that
Kevin Brown	I am and would be surprised if this administration actually follows through with the talk That said while I don t consider this anywhere near a SOLUTION to the drug price problem it is an IMPROVEMENT of significance if there is indeed follow through and a long a there isn t a confidence scam element that proposes it AS a solution instead of an improvement I think credit should be given for that upon said follow through if and when it happens
Michael Esparza	This is not a solution but it is a step in the right direction
darcsystems	Though I fully support the transparency especially if they expect people to walk into their doctor office and tell THEM what drug they should be taking I feel that given this administration track record this is just a ploy to protect insurance company from having to pay for expensive drug I m in no way in support of saving insurance company money They re vulture
William Lennie	This story is too US centric How dare ye
Terrence Taylor	You should totally call this series Quick Phil
B-RONE	It s drug it addiction the shrink just want your money It start with depression isn t it weird how all of the symptom of depression are symptom of other mental illness Ask your doctor what mental illness he think you will have two visit later Think I m lying thats cool find out the hard way Its never just 1 pill
Asian Man	I like the idea But they could do a little better
margie schlieter	Call your doctor if you experience coma or death
Gla Brakr	Personally I think that it s the consumer responsibility to talk to their doctor and inform themselves on alternative treatment Who out there didn t take a look at the cost of their drug before buying them If it the only option and they are expensive you would pay up regardless I feel this is some attack on pharma because there is this perception that they take advantage of their consumer Maybe so but this allows them to fund more research and discover new treatment By shaming drug company for their price we could end up hindering the drug discovery process
Tyler Durden	Hey Phil just wanted to let you know that unsurprisingly neither this video or the video from later on today popped up in my feed so Youtube is still fucky about subscription Also the whole If you have the side effect of death call your doctor is fucking hilarious
Brandonlm2010	It s probably still going to be really hard to see and something people won t be able to pay attention to I don t know they always have trick
TheBaconBuizel	Credit to the Trump admin As much a I dislike most of what they do but this seems good Perhaps too good but let ’ s see where it go
edstirling	I think they should allow any product publicly advertised to be purchased without a prescription This is a free country ain t it I mean freedom is why they let big pharma run ad
Timtomjg	Brought to you by BetterHelp
Daniel Crisostomo	Thx for this
MegaChazv2	Yes
W3ST	Health company just won t advertise on tv and advertise more on social medium and radio and reading material
Sam Brink	I am very surprised the Trump administration is doing this and I do think it will help out consumer and create more obvious competition with other prescription drug causing price to drop
Kyle Higgins	It doesn t hurt but can only help so why not
William Summy	Let s see if the Left even mention this Cuz this is liberal
Audrianna Bornamann	Yes Love this video
Mary Light	I m actually surprised by this it coming from Trump all tho I am suspicious but it s still so far a good thing I think
CouragePope	Trump is the best What now NPC Orange man bad
Evangeliman	It s inefectual pandering for vote
Becca Flinn	I like the idea behind this but I m confused a to how this is going to change anything When I talk to my doctor about the prescription I get we always talk about the competition s medicine and how it is better worse a well a what the price are and what insurance usually cover Even if you see the price on an ad wouldn t you still talk to your doctor about it I might not be getting the whole picture though a I have never been in the position of hearing about a prescription on TV then asking my doctor about it
crazywriterchic	Or you could ban the commercial
Darn	Let s go Trump
Jacoby Rassilon	I don t see how these ad are responsible for the uptick in prescription drug use they are some of the most boring and sleep inducing commercial that I ve ever seen If they want to sell it right put hot chick in bikini in their viagra commercial
Crystal Elkins	Here ’ s another HUGE factor that people fail to understand Even if your insurance cover a medication eventually someone ha to pay for it At the end of every year insurance company evaluate how much they paid out in claim and predict how much they will have to pay out over the next year This is how your insurance rate are calculated So when everyone want to be on the latest and greatest med or see specialist or have expensive procedure etc that all ultimately raise the price of your insurance But from an immediate standpoint an individual just see it a “ great My insurance cover it and my copay is only xxx Not considering what the original price wa and how eventually everyone on that insurance plan end up having to pay for it This is how small company insurance rate go through the roof when someone is diagnosed with an expensive disease like cancer or an autoimmune disease which ha some of the highest priced drug out there Sure insurance company may have negotiated lower price but on a say 1000 medication how much do you think they can really negotiate that down to And that ’ s once a month for 12 month That REALLY add up when more and more people go to ask their doc for the latest and greatest med There ’ s a reason why you see ad for what you see those are the money maker Drugs that have huge price Go look up the cost of Humara and Lyrica which I ’ m constantly seeing add for A lot of these could be solved if we had a single payer system and the government utilized it bargaining power It would also be better if drug company weren ’ t allowed to advertise Great book on this subject is “ Overdosed America ”
Nightmare2018	This is an issue that s near and dear to my heart I m happy that Trump admin tackled it even though I had no idea they were going to This is a very powerful change and I hope that he doe everything is powered to do what he is set out to do
ITickle Chickens	This could also work the opposite way Company s that make the generic version of a drug could see the price and decide that they aren t charging enough for theirs
Christopher Craig	What I ’ m saying is we can empower the pharmaceutical and make more money Kanye West to not my president Donald Trump and medium
Sammy Miller	Drug company shouldn t be advertising prescription drug in the first place
Steve Watts	Nothing is more effective than PDF Not to be taken with alcohol
clolton	wait what s the catch
PhobosDynami	Wait Trump is doing something against big company I want to see how people react to this
muddi900	Most people do not pay out of pocket for prescription drug Your doctor should be able to tell how much your drug will cost you They can t They can t tell you how much they will charge you untill you drive down to their office give them insurance info pay them the co pay and then get another fucking bill in the mail Literally 50 of healthcare cost problem can be solved by price transparency I can compare the price of a fucking bag of chip but not an XRay
TheHomebounded	Coma or death a these may become permanent Death isn t permanent you don t say
SuperBellyflop	I will admit I am intrigued by this As someone who ha a medication that is almost 400 a month for one of my med I would definitely like to see where this go
Ceci Lopez-Cotarelo	In the UK prescription cost like £7 and the elderly and those on lower income don t have to pay Healthcare in the USA never cease to baffle me
Tyler Joseph Schommer	Maybe just ban the ad
Kevin Whitter	I can get behind this trump move
David Fields	Restricting the rule to just TV is very short sighted Print and online advertising should be included I have not watched real TV in over 5 year
Kevin Booth	Re Pharma Ads This administration ha done so little that is in the interest of the people that I have to ask what horrendous this they did are doing or intend to do which they are using this change to distract the people from
Harry slothsak	I wa so happy to see a morning show notification while I wa at work this morning I love yo face too Phil
Calvin Lippert	it not the job of the government to regulate the marketing of drug Absolute authoritarianism
Ninja Man	I better call my doctor before my coma or death becomes permanent
maskyschannel	let s talk about your prescription yes dad
Jamie Griffin	I recently got sick with a respiratory infection I wa prescribed three thing two cough medication and an inhaler The total wa 120 The inhaler alone wa 85 and I couldn ’ t even use it because it had lactose in it And you can ’ t return prescription drug EVEN IF they ’ re unopened Ridiculous
Mir Residence	Love the video but Phil why you sitting off centre
Chris Lamrock	You guy are being suckered So Trump kick million off of their healthcare and then now is like look what I am doing to help How doe this even work You go to your doctor he say you need a type of medication and then what Do you say Just a minute while I download some ad Any doctor worth their salt will tell you about the generic drug At least that s how it work here in Canada
Eric Hough	Now I know how much it s going to cost me to go tell the doctor I have restless leg
Matthew Mueller	Medicare for all

Lincoln Hawk	Big Pharma 🖕
darthzero50	call your doctor if you have coma or death errr wot
St0rm Ranger	The drug tsar wa going to be pro pharma they must have lowballed his bribe this year
Dustin Rodriguez	I learned that Social Anxiety Disorder wa a thing from a TV commercial for Paxil It changed my life immensely for the better Prior to it I had no idea such a disorder even existed and thought the problem it caused me were impossible to change So while I understand that people don t see pharma commercial a something that s a good idea I always shrink from proposal that they should be banned like they are in many country I know in my case my life would be much worse without them WRT price transparency this is VERY dangerous Consider this scenario You have health insurance which pay your family medical expense Your child break their arm There are 2 doctor in your town One doctor will put the child arm in a cast for 50 The other doctor will put the child arm in a cast for 500 You pay nothing regardless of which doctor you go to Which doctor are you going to take your child to The cheap one No This creates what I call reverse capitalism The more you charge the more reputable your medical service appears to be and the more business you will get The existence of medical insurance creates this So when people see they could take a 5 pill solution for their back pain or take the 150 pill solution and their insurance is footing the bill in either case they ARE going to go for the more expensive one People do not want to bargain hunt for their own well being And certainly not on behalf of the faceless insurance company that they re going to have to fight tooth and nail with for month in either case
QuestForTheOpenRoad	I agree with price disclosure We also need this in medical care dental and eye care facility I found that my insurance make up number each day on how much they are willing to pay toward a given procedure My son got a strep test the same day his cousin without insurance did we paid over 120 out of pocket Their cash price wa 42 What is my insurance doing for me Helping me pay for thoes without insurance
quotejoss	They don t even say the side effect in new Zealand and the ad are also disguised a friendly health talk show
oneenigma4u	All for the law if a drug company is going to Market directly to the people they should tell the people the price Just maybe it might stop the BS of different marketing pricing You know like artificially bumping up the price in a richer Market
HistoricaHungarica	This proposal is smoke and mirror If they want to smack down on the pharma industry then the government would FUND A WORKING HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN This is just letting a couple of company thrive on the fall of the others
MIBuckeye60	Angry bird pillow please
mastoner20	Coma or death a these may become permanent Oh shit Since when
Tenshi Chan	coma or death a these may become permanent Yes that is generally how death work it s pretty freaking permanent
RocketFamily KML	Love that or death a they may become permanent
Sarah Norrie	Shame culture is huge right now Consumers are more informed when they buy something and this will absolutely effect the company that fail to comply
Phantomx79	The medical charge in this country are insane The government need to get it under control and stop letting them charge outrageous price for shit
Yusra	lot of graphic huh phil
KHJohan	coma and death a they may become permanent
Agent Ham	This law is an empty gesture a long a they don t require pricing to be shown online More and more people get their news medium from the internet and le from TV
Bob Pickleson	Literally all they need to do is say “ Consumer price may vary based on insurance ” under the price tag What a stupid counterargument Big Pharma
Josh Hufstedler	Is this crap and useless how many people actually us their television to watch TV anymore they use these mostly use it for internet
Lauren P	Coming from someone who work at a pharmacy I do see both side My thing is that a lot of drug have a “ cash ” price that could be hundred of dollar per month though the insurance plan will cover the majority of the cost leading to a low monthly copay In my opinion drug company are not completely to blame for high pricing we also should look to how much people are paying to their insurance each month insurance formulary which could be potential conflict of interest I don ’ t think showing price in advertising is a cure all solution to the high cost drug issue
nargacuga05	Just the tv ad could be better but this probably is a step in the right direction
kurt lindner	This is such a scam designed to look good it seemingly doe very little for the consumer
Cory Johnson	Love the morning video
Gergo Fusti-Molnar	1 08 wow I never would have thought death could become permanent
rettwoods	We are truly in A Brave New World Aldous Huxley Read it Soma indeed
Marissa Wood	Why do I never get a notification for these
toorimakun	Honestly this probably wont do anything on it own but a step in the right direction So much focus on insurance and not enough on these drug company when a privet company can sell a drug for 30 00 and then when it get bought out by a corporation it sell the same drug for 9000 00 that is clear bullshit I have tried to explain this to people but most people have complete blind faith in drug company and hospital doctor This could get people to not have such blind faith and be critical of the corporate health care system and THAT is what is going to lower price
3headedpuppy	Did that AD just say that taking that med could lead to death which could be perminent Perminent death
wardrich	Idiots Just preface the price with Without insurance this drug will cost X Price may vary with insurance coverage
Kyle Schaff	As a person who ’ s on medication that I need to live I think that it is essential that we pressure big pharma to lower their price I may have good insurance that cover the cost but I know that there are plenty of those who are in my medical situation who can not receive treatment due to affordability
Cindy Kramer	THE HIGH SCHOOL DEBATE TOPIC
Czar Warudo	Regardless of whether or not price drop more information for consumer is always good This shouldn t be confined to just TV ad On the other hand ORANGE MAN BAD
artekonto19	I think the advertising area is a huge issue Not many people who need the medication use the TV a their main viewing platform this also might push ad to play on video platform such a Netflix This publicity about the medication will also not include the cost of generic formula because most doctor and pharmacy help with thing like that It might also increase the price of medication in the long run causing thing like the epipen price jack that we had because of the owner of the brand increasing the price by 400 500 making it almost impossible for those in poverty to afford a life saving medication It could also be like insulin where the price to buy it around the world is around 5 to 10 per vial while in the U S it is over 300 this increase mean that people who need it to survive will not have the medication and will die from it This mean that if the price go public both the on brand price and the generic price will increase this price increase will cause thousand if not million of people to die from not being able to afford their medication This feel liek it could be the Government saying they could care le if people die a long a we profit from it This is not a new thing this ha been going on for a while
hero4sure	As a pharmacist who work for a pharmaceutical company not commercial side you couldn t be more wrong Phil
ChefAllez	I feel like this whole price thing is way out of proportion It seems incredibly easy for them to say Pill X cost 500 but the average insured user pay 33 for their prescription Unless this proposal specifically block them from being able to put an average price Most people are going to listen over reading anyways they could place the price on screen then speak the average price instead
Matt Dylla	I m I m not used to feeling of hope regarding the pharmaceutical industry Anything any law to help customer and to control that consumer gouging beast is a welcome change a far a I m concerned
Carl Popkes	The only way to decrease the price of prescription drug and healthcare in general is to open the health insurance market to allow policy to be sold across state line much like car insurance Let the consumer shop around for the coverage they want at a price they can afford Watch the premium fall
steve johnson	Trump winner
ELEXCEER	Don t use prescription drug it cause mental illness use betterhelp com 🍃
Vegetarians Taste Better	As a liberal health care provider hell fucking yes trump administration
Emma Nichols	Half the issue with big pharma is drug rep I ve worked in two medical office and they re like vulture the way that they operate They come into office offer sample that get patient hooked on the drug when they could easily be give the much cheaper generic and they essentially bribe the doctor with informational conference at fancy restaurant Yes it is good that doctor get information about all the option on the market but when the bribery begin is when it need to stop
David Stymiest	Believe it or not before Bill Clinton wa president this is what it wa like Then Bill gave big pharma carte blanche and capability to advertise on tv Clintons you got to love em
momboom1	Whether or not it lower drug price it s a good change
Jk channel	vote red people
rondalea mcleod	a someone from canada ware we have free medical care it often boggles our mind how much medicine cost in the USA and that people will often refuse treatment or a simple doctor visit simply because they can t afford it
Kangaroo	LOL these guy It s not fair to list the actual price because your insurance pay most of it sometimes NICE FUCKING TRY YES they do but that s also why they are so fucking expensive they know that if you have insurance it mean they will get a guaranteed 80 idk the number of the drug paid for regardless of price FUCK outta here acting like just because insurance pay most of it like the burden doesn t still fall on consumer anyway We can t say for certain if it will cause them to lower price but there s a good chance Even if it doesn t this is a step in the right direction of transparency The US health system is extremely anti consumer anti competition anti capitalism anti american Regardless of if you believe in free health care it is a fact that if heathcare wa a competitive marketplace price would be significantly lower While healthcare can never be truly competitive we need to STOP shielding healthcare from competition
Guywholikes goodmusic	So basically one of Big Pharma s argument against the proposal is that it will limit their First Amendment Right to mislead consumer Fuck them I m glad this Alex Azar isn t shilling out in the industry he used to work for like Ajit Pai is doing for Big ISPs It s no secret that Big Pharma is one of the scummiest industry on the planet a they capitalize on human illness
StarSeeker	Not gon na lie I haven t agreed with a lot of what the Trump administration ha done but I can definitely get behind this
Michael Feeney	Not a trump supporter but really like this sort of legislation
Rhetorical Zombie	labeling off side effect or death As these may become permanent Well you re not wrong
JRBDBC	we should join the country that ban farma add totally on all platform
Dalton Riser	I wa expecting a joke and an odd graphic to go with it adter all the side effect clip from watching john oliver every week
KingKyleSI	Great for the consumer and American ppl I hope this is Bi Partisan
Lizzie Moss	If it doe work what industry do you think will be next
Dracomon	Meh
Logically-Pastel	Just have them list the price then add a disclaimer that state that it may vary or be reduced based on your insurence there problem solved
Laura Evans	Hey Can this Pharmacy Technician get a pin on this comment to help the people of the nation Nation If you absolutely need that expensive medication and can ’ t afford it look into patient support program They may be able to help you get your medication at a lower cost or they can work with the manufacturer to get you compassionate supply Please look into this option if it will help
00 00	how about we just dont pay for thing we need to survive
HighMagnitudeGT	Trump really is making America great again Damn I didn ’ t think he could do it
Uchiha	Listen I am the first to applaud Trump when he actually doe something good because I m not a partisan hack For instance I think it great that he opened up line of communication with North Korea and is making an effort to deescalate the situation With that being said this whole thing come off like a ploy so the administration can SAY that they brought positive change to this issue without really changing all that much What REALLY should be happening is the passing of S 771 Improving Access To Affordable Prescription Drugs Act which wa consider dead on arrival in the Senate This bill would allow negotiating the price of these drug so we could pay closer to the rate the rest of the world pay http www congress gov bill 115th congress senate bill 771 What they are trying to do right now is a half measure at best There is a reason that the people appointed to run these department worked for these corporation and it not because of their experience working in that field
Kevyn King	Coma or death a these may become permanent fuck sake 😂
mxchic05	If Trump is able to do this this could definitely secure his 2nd term
WhatAHero	This bill help no one Do you think there s a choice here Do you think I want to pay for prescription drug every month That I look for the cheapest option when considering something a important a my health No this is about people buying a thing they don t want to take but NEED to to survive I like being able to breath with my inhaler I like being able to see with my contact glass I like a healthy life This is a dirty business but it s one that give a needed product a product that is sold by such a small amount of company that it is a monopoly Does this suck yeah but showing the price of a product that isn t a want but a need isn t helpful to anyone who doesn t have the luxury to stop buying them
Watching Quietly	They re putting chemical in the water to make frog gay froglivesmatter 😂🤣😆
Leah McPherson	I strongly suspect this event wa started with the previous administration Trump doesn t surround himself with compassionate or intelligent people but Obama doe This administration is surfing the wave generated from the hard work of others just a the next administration will be drowning in this idiot s cesspool
brian almanza	Why don t they just put a disclaimer next to the price stating that the actual price you pay may be lower based on your insurance That way hopefully it won t scare people off from the priceing
Maxwell Warlick	Putting your graphic department to work on this vid Well done
Lavenderstar The Dragon	Unedited footage of a bear
Aaron	Look up “ war on consciousness ” if your not brainwashed yet
Cheyenne Collier	How do you think this is going to effect the opioid epidemic though
YingofDarkness	I think they should expand it to at last cover any ad that show up on social medium site That is a big part of their market and hopefully this doe something A step in the right direction is still a step even if it isn t a big one
Dirk Strider	Could you post ALL your source in the description of your video
Octodog	Haven t been a big fan of Trump overall but this I can get behind
Matthew Holman	Why didn t you include the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patients Right to Know Drug Prices Act in this coverage They are 2 law Trump recently signed that go along with this topic
Daniel George	Almost no one actually need Anti Depressants ADHD Pills or sleeping aid they do more harm than good people who need them are in EXTREME risk I feel sad i will take anti depressant not how it should work more like i will kill myself i should take anti depressant to stop myself Reducing the cost of normal med will make Healthcare cheaper and more affordable Insurance price will go down quality will go up because competition will exist almost no negative impact on the consumer
davante barbain	So death can be a permanent side affect huh who knew 😱😕😂😂
Kyobi	Well the proposed pharma law look relatively toothless I doubt they would follow the law if the penalty would be public shaming on something that they re already doing
Larry Duran	I actually think this is a good move on President Trump s part by being able to compare pricing or rather having a high price range to start from allows me to negotiate a lower price and in doing so save my Insurance company and in turn should lower insurance premium and drug pricing due to competition for my business When did the Competition for my business become this is what you need according to big pharma
thebigJohnnyD	As an Aussie it wa so jarring when YouTube channel like Roosterteeth started advertising online prescription medication that let you ‘ avoid awkward doctor visit ’ by having doctor who work for the website who can prescribe it for you online It wa also weird when I went to America and saw the ad on tv It ’ s crazy to me that America allows it at all whether or not they show the price
Forcemaster2000	Death may become permanent ROFL
Shawn Moses	In the American medical market it seems the only aspect of healthcare that is subject to competition is insurance company causing the insurance compnanies to try and out compete their competitor with lower price Pharmaceutical company don t feel this pressure and can charge whatever they want Competition is always a good thing so I hope these change go through
Henry Bones	This seems to be a midterm move to get more vote but if it pass it should be a good thing
Silence Dogood	Having worked in healthcare for over 20 year it is my experience that the true problem is health insurance The concern about price confusion is very real One insurance company can have thousand of plan This is why doctor s office and hospital always ask for your card and run a check The insurance company can change plan so what you had six month ago may not still be covered now Providing an average or even a list is not going to work unless this list is updated by the insurance company in real time I do think there need to be a change to the pharma industry but it is more complex than simply looking at the cost to make a drug The cost of research on successful drug can be staggering and that doe not count the larger portion of failed research cost I am still happy to see the government taking a harder stance with pharmaceutical Now take on the insurance oligopoly
Amy Tanabe	im from New Zealand and i havnt noticed any ad like that anyone else from New Zealand care to enlighten me
MyKingofdiamonds	Seems like a good first step but I ’ d like to know what the price of prescription med would be without advertising
Herois1900	And yet again another example of how much the Trump administration care LOL
CJ Kluszynski	damn trump doing sumn gud
SHELLBACKS CLUB 🐢	Canada also allows the ad
Ryuhouji	I absolutely WANT this to happen I think it would increase approval rate too and he want to be re elected So LESDOIT
Cris D	I m totally for lower drug price crazy how one or two pill that can save life can cost up to thousand it isn t fair at all
Space Rose	I think it a good idea
john smith	Damn phil I guess you ’ re stepping up that editing game
milknskittles	Lovin the new style Philly
Jeff Daniels	death may become permanent generally yeah that s generally what happens
aznfratboy1	I m not familiar with the pharma industry so please chime in if I m incorrect but isn t medication almost identical to any other product The price is set by effectively a retailer your local pharmacist The pharmaceutical company would set a RRP but doesn t the pharmacist reserve the right to effectively undercut the final price for competitive advantage
Dastiel4ever	As someone who is chronically ill and look at the price of the drug I take without insurance I don t see a downside in continuing to have this discussion It seems there are a lot of people who are on the fence about it which is understandable but I think this discussion need to continue There is a possibility that this could work the government just need to say how and why it will change thing It will take time but I think it is worth it by having this conversation it is bringing up a serious issue in this country Prescription drug are so expensive especially for people who don t have good insurance I think that this need to change a I have said many time in the past if you don t have your health you don t have much else Less likely to hold down a job unable to support yourself etc
Steph Wilson	Okay I never say this But fuck yeah Trump administration
B French	What a big argument over an insignificant change This doesn t give incentive to lower price in any way if somebody need a prescription it doesn t matter whether or not the company selling the drug put the price in their advert this will not factor into their decision to buy it
Scarf3086	a someone who work in the healthcare industry a a data scientist I can see this not working to effectively lower the price of drug honestly consumer transparency doesn t really affect the cost of healthcare due to other confounding factor additionally these company will find a way to message this assuming they lose their legal battle in a way that take the burden off the consumer this could mean having the actual price after insurance estimate the only thing that will really work is if cm actually enforces regulation on price through medicare medicaid AND congress pass some sort of measure forcing price to match those in the general market using something like a cap ex cm pay 80 for drug x and all other party can only pay 25 more than that max for the same drug good luck getting THAT through congress
Baffled BumbleBee	This move doesn t really seem like it s going to have a meaningful effect Very little is actually being required of the drug company To me it really only appears that they are doing this so that the can say that they have done something about the pharma industry to check it off of the administration s list a a win I don t see how this will impact pricing or prescribing practice in the long term or short term for that matter If anything we ll just see more online social medium print and billboard ad
Sticklarry	Coma or death a these may be permanent Well count me in I want death to be only possibly permanent
jesse garza	Comma or death these maybe permanent
Trevor Owens	It ’ s a good start Treating symptom over problem isn ’ t the solution Can ’ t make money on healthy people
William North	I think this is still not addressing the main issue insurance company I ve worked a a pharmacy technician since 2013 and the main thing I ve noticed is whenever the pricing is high the insurance is the main cause Here s an example Let s say you have a prescription that s 200 cash price The insurance covered the full script so no cost to you at the pharmacy When I go for reimbursement from the insurance they tell me that my reimbursement of 100 will be in the next check they send u This mean insurance company choose how much they will pay It set the entire attitude of the market thus falsely inflating pricing I want to buy cheap and sell higher to afford to stock the medication and make a profit Manufacturers sell for higher because they need to turn a profit too sometimes too greedy like EpiPen In the end since the insurance chooses how much to pay if at all chargebacks are something where they change their mind after covering it initially the market is forced to jack price up to make their own profit It s a despicable system that I wish wa addressed since the only thing it doe is screw people over that don t have insurance or have the best insurance tier Sadly it doesn t just stop there the same thing is going on in hospital with the Charge Master but I m gon na stop here
Reed Noss	I wa on Latuda for a year and it made me a zombie that ’ s the drug with the coma and death commercial

Nidhoggr	Let your doctor know if symptom like coma or death occur
Lilly Azura	Oh my god i so fucking hope they do that THAT WOULD BE AMAZING if pharmaceutical listed all that in ad
Tokagaro0	That The Big Question text wa very jarring more so than the just generally different edit style
Dood1494	In term of enforcement we can set up a national Advertiser Blacklist that list any corporation whose advertisement violates the regulation that are put in place This would be available to television station and network so that they can compare their advertiser to the list If an advertisement from a blacklisted corporation is aired the station network that aired the advertisement will be fined accordingly A corporation may be removed from the list after a certain waiting period a long a they have a suitable replacement advertisement prepared This replacement can be reviewed by some third party to ensure it complies with the regulation Punishments could become more severe based on repeated violation

Nathan Long	We should see the price on all good if you think you can ’ t afford it then you just can ’ t afford it Stop wishing to hide something that would ruin the American public if they purchased a drug and then they have to sell it illegally or do something crazy to want more of it Be transparent and not disobedient

ZacPB189	Transparency is always the right answer Except maybe if the question is What color should my clothes be today
Duds	sound like big pharma don t want u to know the margin on the pill they sell
TheRodrigo1555	Great PR stunt for the Trump administration but they and everybody else know there are a thousand way Big Pharma can torpedo this on Capitol Hill
ottoismy1dog	I honestly don t understand the commercial these are prescription drug prescription drug that you need a prescription from a doctor to obtain do people actually see a commercial and then go to the doctor s office and say I saw this cool ad for fill in the blank why don t you write me script for a 3 month supply so that I can see how I like it and then the doctor doe it
Decaf 21	Step in the right direction sort of I think personally it intentionally miss the mark and is actually simply posturing for the upcoming election Even if this doe become a policy I doubt it will significantly affect drug price These are still need for most people Not want So they will still he able to rape your wallet
Joshua Durben	I can ’ t wait for liberal to try and argue against this only because this is being done under the Trump Administration
Fernando Lavalle	Add price to TV add What on Earth is a TV
Sgt Worm	How about you list how much it cost you to produce each individual pill cc or per dosage anywhere your product is listed in any way then
MetalMattila	While I think it is a great idea to advertise the cost of the drug it seems this is a rather moot point It is no secret that brand name prescription drug are extremely expensive the high cost is due to the lack of competition inability for the public to know what pharmacy benefit manager have negotiated the price at and many of these drug are me too drug where a cheaper alternative already exists In short ask your pharmacist They are an excellent resource for drug pricing and therapy selection Not to mention they are underutilized for cost saving
one penny	Bullshit statistic It s like the cigarette stats If you died while being a smoker then your name is added onto death by cigarette Even if you died in a car accident 7 10 Americans probably do have a prescription but it could be for Sudafed because they have allergy Not every prescription drug is going to be like oxy Xanax or perc Though I do believe that prescription drug are an American epidemic Lies are only going to make thing worse for those who need help What doe the government do to stop it s population from taking these thing They either become illegal and the person is thrown into prison and or the tax on the item go up The government isn t caring about people they re caring about damage control a if they were the fire department tackling a house fire You need to know what caused the fire before putting it out otherwise it consumes whole neighborhood or even engulfs a city The answer can t always be throw water on it

xxNATHANUKxx	Drug company shouldn ’ t be able to advertise full stop Doctors should be the only one to prescribe drug a they know more than anyone wa a patient need
herp derp	Isn t it funny how Republicans are all for the free market except when they aren t to be clear I agree with this move but that doesn t mean I can t find it hypocritical

Paul Smith	prescription drug shouldn t be advertised if you have a problem go see the doc that way you get what you need not what TV tell you
Cartoon Central	pretty liberal move from the trump turd there
lovethedancingflames	Very cool Thank you for filling u in on all this As a future pharmacist this is very interesting to me
Cashew Minnow	The punishment for not complying need to be an actual loss for the drug company otherwise they ll just oops didn t mean to forget their 3000 price tag that would definitely make people look for alternative and improve competitive price
philmanable	Not gon na lie saw Shayne Dawson on the other thumbnail and noped right away from it
Visioneer68	Drug company advertising and it s driving up the cost How surprising is that How about the cable company sending me multiple mega advertisement every month to expand my cable service Or every other regular company that sends out ton of advertising material Sure they all want to make a buck but I have to believe that a lot of these company spend more on the cost of advertising than the return they get Also I have never gone to my doctor and suggested a medication to prescribe to me because I saw an advertisement for it Advertising on TV is just time to go get a drink or use the restroom If I m not doing that I am doing something else and completely zone out from listing to ad
thepap 000	Trump doing something good
thekamotodragon	this seems like a a positive change for the people by this administration i always saw those commercial a vile and i think everyone know the drug company in the u are well evil or at least have selfish intention so hopefully they don t twist this into being a negative for the consumer through some legality meandering with the insurance company

David Thomas	While we re at it can we make insulin considered a life saving drug
Brendan Smith	1 12 death is permenant I had no idea
JKL	I think I would like better clarification on the second point of the government being allowed to negotiate price I just imagine the future to be convoluted with government control of which drug should be lower and do they get a kickback if the drug company lower the price I personally think that they should lower the limitation of generic drug rule The drug company make their money on the name brand version of the drug Generics are not able to be created when a drug launch
Matt T	coma or death a these may become permanent I actually lol ed at that I m actually very very shocked that the Trump appointee is doing something that big pharma is against Their stated goal of bringing down out of pocket cost a lofty and noble a it is is also vague a shit What action are going to lead u to that end or is this just another federal power grab I think most republican don t want the government to have expanded power in any capacity Remember if you re ok with your guy doing it consider how you ll feel in 2 to 6 year if the other guy is in charge will you still be ok with it then I say no personally

Emily Anderson	yo you just helped my debate so much D thx sm
Bullie Mthembu	As someone outside of America I find this situation baffling at best and deeply disturbing at the worst A lot of the drug being marketed directly to consumer are opiate classically addictive substance I f wa a dealer I wouldn t let new buyer know how much their addiction is likely to cost them a year down the road it seems to me that they re trying to get people hooked by obfuscating the price because that expense loses importance a the addiction progress Lowering price and demanding clear label on pharma advert miss the entire point consumer are not the best decision maker when it come to medication doctor are It s irrelevant what measure Trump take to increase transparency because your decision is never going to be a well informed a a doctor It s a having your cake and eating it too situation what with the drug war going on in the background I wish you guy the best because this 300 billion industry certainly isn t Edit Thanks for correcting my misinformation I got it from Adam Ruins Everything when he wa talking about your opioid epidemic I d be curious to know what drug they do advertise and how much enforcement the government ha on company that might violate this law As a former addict I feel strongly about this issue no matter where it occurs so that s why I threw my two penny in Have a nice day everyone
Sherry Baker	I wrote an entire paper on this in university Please keep in mind that retail setting also doe not include those in long term care facility
David	Still nothing about the 20 Muslim men sentenced to 221 year in jail for raping sexually exploiting White girl in the UK for over a decade And that the UK Government had stopped the medium reporting on it for a YEAR that political correctness is getting young girl raped time again Come on Phil
BonJoviSXS	First I am not American so my thought here might be invalid from that From what I can see the cost of the prescription is more or le found out once they finish going through their insurance company right now So after they get the prescription from the doctor meaning at that they would likely need to go get a new prescription if they find it too expensive at that point True they might be able to get the price earlier if they are resourceful but advertisement would be the main way to find out price for any product So you could consider it a trap once you find out the price you are already fairly invested in getting it meaning competition can not do it work The argument of saying insurance would make the price meaningless is likely a completely bogus standpoint a well since most insurance company I know of use percentage of cost for prescription so if it 50 then they can look at the price ha halved with their insurance If the cost benefit ratio of the drug is far behind the completion then insurance company would likely refuse to or cover le of it therefore le people would get it and they would feel the need to drop their price so the insurance company cover it in a similar fashion to similar drug
Michael Ford	I honestly do think this will cause them to lower their price The profit margin are so high in the pharma industry that they will not want a bad light on them when they can sell them for le and sell more of them But it s just my theory maybe I m wrong
mister smoky	on an economical level transparency of price will lower the market but on the other hand what will happen to the opioid epidemic would lowering leagal drug with opioids make a greater pay gap from when they have to stop using here an example if a doctor prescribes a bottle of opioid pill at 10cc per pill at 200 and on the street you get heroin for 300 and is super strong so low the price to 70 and lower the dosage creating a larger gap that a pacient would have to pay when turning to the street
Name Less	wow consult your doctor is your sideeffect is death dont think that will happen
Marina McKinley	I believe it depends on the type of drug and if it is still protected by patent a to whether or not drug company will lower the price if forced to disclose For example will it change the game on Epipen Probably not Will it change the price on cancer treatment Also probably not But it may change the pricing model for some drug like antidepressant of which there are dozen of variety on the same basic model SSRIs and SNRIs There are even drug within these class with basically the same mechanism of action I wa on one antidepressant for several year before my doctor suggested I change to another which wa basically that company s attempt at making a new patent The new drug had a slightly delayed metabolism time and thus a longer halflife But that wa the only difference I didn t know better so I wa willing to pay more for this newer drug simply because my doctor told me to Hopefully a law like this may prevent this from happening and may prevent pharma from attempting to make new patent on essentially the same drug
27duuude	Wicked early mornin bub got ta let the east coast early bird know whats up before we go out the door Good call m8

Margaret Mcnab	Am from the UK so find this al strange I am in Scotland so we don t pay for prescription at all and only made add we see are for miner pain killer and rub like ibuprofen so I really listened 2 the short snipe of the add u showed and did u note that at the end in the side affect wa death and then call ur doctor a this may become pregnant no u don t say lol 😄
Coe Hart	It s not really surprising They are scared to death of universal healthcare and they know they have to do something Too many people are fed up with medical cost
JPEGonyourface	i am from australia the answer is simple don t show the ad s ever done
Jillian W	since many american are struggling to pay for medication from predatory captalism then the only logical solution would be to enact single payer healthcare
Sharyn Barney	The best way to lower drug cost is to make all pharmaceutical company non profit
zuldo	Drug commercial in the US is insane You have a headache stomach ache or feel tired sometimes Ask your doctor about this pill Combine that with how easy it is to doctor shop in the US and it no wonder you have a problem with excess prescription treatment
Inspector Steve	Wow Phil actually saying something good about trump Has hell frozen over I wish Phil would give u the actual fact on the rest of his story I feel he s just like the liberal medium because all of his story support the left Also people are paying for defranco elite so Phil can make more content Yet we have been getting le and le
Andrew Hall	Love the idea of morning video on singular topic but I miss seeing Phil talk with his hand for the entire video 😉
danny Last	big pharm ha been gouging the public for along time and the elderly are the worst hit knowing these folk have to have their medication big pharm is not a friend to the public
FatKidWithFudge	I never understood the appeal of those commercial I mean sure the visuals are nice They give off a this is perfect to help vibe But then they get into that list of possible side effect I mean there are more possible side effect then what is being treated I take something for headache and my as might fall off Na i ll take my chance without Instead of making me want to try them out them thing just made me laugh Especially the one with the more serious effect while the sweet vid is still playing in the background
Josh Bull	We spend insanely more on medical R D the number 2 guy isn t even close We have the most and largest drug manufacturer in the world so we are making these thing and the cost that go along with that is on u We force insurance company to compete with government regulated program which ensure low cost which in turn force higher cost for everyone else As Ben Shapiro point out our medical care system is not based on socialism OR capitalism and this is where the problem lay we are stuck with the worst of both world This whole transparency will do absolutely nothing because it is not the underlying problem
Wynne DM	I had shingle earlier this year and I remember telling my doctor when I found out that if there were option for the treatment I could take and they did the EXACT SAME THING I wanted the le expensive option Insurance or no having an idea of the price of medication I need may need in the future can be extremely beneficial and in most case the reason someone I know look up their medication cost is because there are a ton of med available that do the same thing or the same thing at a slightly higher or lower dosage for a different price
Sleepy Panda	As a person living in Scotland I continue to find US healthcare wild
*Bobbi *	oh god im having a panic attack
M. Gilley	Waste of time They don t even require to show the price in print ad or online And doe it even matter Doctors will usually prescribe the cheaper option If there IS another option at all we re still the ONLY developed country without some kinda universal coverage It would save two trillion over 10 year the US pay the most for health service of any country in the world and we re in the bottom half when it come to quality People shit themselves over a minor tax increase but for SOME reason don t mind paying even more directly to the insurance company who will actively look for reason not to pay out Yeah Okay We re the richest country in the world there s literally no excuse for this besides the greed of the medical industry Cuba ha a longer life expectancy than we do A really poor supposedly failed nation ha better healthcare Seriously look up life expectancy comparison chart it pretty interesting to see how low the US rank
s g	I don t think it would be effective in the least At the end of the day your still going to face the high cost of a prescription that your insurance allows coverage for If you need it to live you will just buy it to live or make a hard choice You could have allergy to other cheaper alternative America 🇺🇸 anything for that profit margin
Lexie Lou	Drug advertising should be banned period end of story Hope the disgusting people who profit hand over fist off of illness rot in hell
Not Misery	let hear your thought in the comment really mean i know the more comment i get the more my video get pushed
Cory Malik	Love the morning show bring it back fully can never get enough phil
im wrong and youre right because	let talk about you scamming people with mental illness
skullcandy wonderland	honestly think it might make price go higher not just for med but for going to hospital a well i mean think of all the med that get used when just going for broken arm to surgery that then you have to pay for then adding the proscription after yes i wish med would go down and are reliants on them not be a much but the way the system is honestly anything done just make thing worse
Hippo Pilot	Death may become permanent guy

Aidan Sullivan	I ’ m a Bernie bro and I ’ ll beat that baggage but if trump approves this law requiring price and to list competitor that would be sweet
SammaLoo	My comment only regard the quote about how if people see how expensive it is they won t even try to get it I m not necessarily agreeing with the pharmaceutical company but this is absolutely true in my experience I work a a teacher at a Title 1 school with a majority of immigrant student They re constantly telling me Oh I can t afford college because they just look at the tuition and walk away Luckily I have the joy of working with these student and helping them realize that college is an option I help them with financial aide scholarship finding a job and sometimes even the moving process and I m happy to report that many of them are now in college are thinking of a future where college is in it But all of them the student and their family just automatically assume that they won t be able to afford it and thus don t even attempt to make it work or question it It s a sad reality especially since my student came to America for a better life and yet they are continuously pigeonholing themselves
Talanani Yiyaya	Why I should care I You mean why you might care surely Or is this peice biased but not actually biased I m fence sitter defranco but it is really biased shhh
10cody7	damn death is bad enough without permanent death
Hector Tario	More morning video
Rebecca McCreedy	Advertising of prescription drug always seems really foreign to me you should be prescribed them by your doctor for your particular issue not choosing them based on a TV commercial those ad also make the off brand equivalent of drug much le appealing to many consumer when in reality those are the more affordable option Leave the drug choice to the people with the education the make that decision and who can explain the actual scientific probability of the various side effect rather than the fast talking person at the end of a commercial
Nickelplated357 Channel	If trump got the ridiculous prescription price down that could start healing our economy At least make life easier for u poor people If that is the only good thing to come out of his presidency I ’ d call him a good president It would make my life easier

TᕼᕮᗰᕮSSIᕼᗩ	This COULD work in a modest way to lower drug price Specifically the part regarding the ability to display a competitor s price on the same ad If one drug company want to capture the market from a competitor they could price their drug lower and advertise that so people attention would be diverted from the price to the cost saving when compared to their competition s drug That may spark a pricing war that could trend price downwards
djvapid	So drug company will have to list price but only on tv commercial and not through the medium that the vast majority of people more heavily consume such a the internet Sounds like legislation with no real bite
Susan Dryden	I disagree with advertising pharmaceutical on TV and in magazine etc With that said though I think stating the price will only confuse the issue Consumers rarely pay the list price of a drug because of insurance coverage I foresee more confusing legal speak just like the recitation of side effect I do not expect this will lower the price of medicine
andrew laurie	The doctor should be telling the patient what drug to take not the other way around
Exemp Haven	Oh Trump is just doing this because it s a good move ahead of midterm Liberals just trying to take his accomplishment and spin them He campaigned and unlike the president you voted to have for 8 year Obama ours is actually keeping a good majority of his promise I most certainly will be voting for him again Obama did nothing for my people African Americans President Trump actually is by bringing job and tax cut I like a man of action not word And you know what maybe he is JUST doing it for the vote But hey a long a he keep doing move like this and get them done he s got my vote Examples Moving the embassy to Jerusalem making progress with NK getting u out of shitty deal like TPP and into new one negotiated by the government not shitty corporation trying to make a quick buck and much more He ha an ego and I love it A President with an ego will at least try to keep his promise A President like Obama will just keep making promise and failing to keep them Oh and guess what Unlike past president we ve even got President Trump looking at prison reform EVEN OBAMA FAILED TO DO THAT
mulletbaby01	Here is where Phil fails yet again The simple solution is making more drug over the counter for common and long term medical need Thanks to Obama million in the US who suffer from asthma and bronchitis were no longer able to get inhaler over the counter that ran about 12 15 What wa the idea behind one of the dumbest medical decision ever made by a US President Left wing eco nut from the shit hole of CA were upset the propellant wa a cause of global warming with no proof or evidence of the claim So million of people had to go buy higher priced product That is one glaring example More med should be made available You can build safe guard into the system to curb abuse and what not like they have with cough syrup Now add the election where left wing cucks demand medicare cade for all then who will pay for the med used under these plan If we got government out of the health care system price would go down because every day people could find the best deal for RX without being told where they can buy from
Raul Limon Bravo	Coma a death a they may become permanent Permanent death You don t say

spankymcflych	Corporations aren t people they don t have right I don t give a shit about the legal personhood garbage they ve forced on u all corporation don t have a right to free speech Corporations have privilege the PEOPLE grant them
Aaron Hutchinson	My initial thought on this is not positive Because of the stipulation that website would be exempt from this doe that mean that ad on place like YouTube or similar website would also be exempt If they are then I don ’ t see much of a change As for most people that I know they don ’ t watch television anymore and if they do it ’ s recorded stuff that they just skip ad or mute them That said the intent is in the right place I just don ’ t think this would be effective
Cory Gunther	All comment aside Phil where s your FACE I understand the idea behind this new style but I feel like the majority of your viewer wan na see your face at least a little bit in these type of video You goofy little shit you
CynicallyHopeful	As others have brought up part of our high drug cost is our lack of an ability to negotiate price a a whole country I d rather see them tackle that bullet point first It s down to each insurance company to negotiate and there are thousand of plan out there It s crazy convoluted However there s also the PBMs Pharmacy Benefit Managers They re the middle men who are supposed to help health insurance company manage their drug policy a well a negotiate what kind of profit pharmacy will make off each drug So big pharmacy like Walgreens Walmart and CVS can negotiate more profit while small home town pharmacy can t I actually had to stop filling two of my script at my independent pharmacy because my insurance wasn t even going to pay them the cost of the drug let alone a profit Walmart No problem filling them If you need to pay full price for a drug Walgreens is one of the most expensive place to fill PBM contract have a lot to do with that Those cost get passed up the chain too to the drug manufacturer There s also some shady kick back program to the PBMs And that doesn t even include the kickback their rep get for selling a practice on a certain drug It s a ridiculously tangled process and it s difficult to follow the paper trail Putting up the drug price may help people understand just what these med cost and look at what their insurance company is paying It s a step a small step which may help get more accountability and transparency from PBMs since the pharmaceutical company will want to point finger elsewhere I m cynical about it though It sound helpful at least a step But a a previous pharmaceutical CEO the HHS secretary know that this is the smallest step they can take that will still look like they re doing something without doing much in the long run I did see an article last year in the NY Times about how Trump want to tackle drug cost and PBMs So maybe
Maria Luke	1 The should definitely extend this to internet ad suchs a ad on internet video and the like 2 If insurance plan change price add in a note that Your insurance plan may change the price talk to your insurance provider if their plan cover these price 3 Releasing the price might actually throw people into a rage about how ridiculous some of them are which is good Public backlash and if it s bad enough rioting usually make company think twice about their pricing habit provided the backlash is big enough The fact that company are fighting to prevent this tell me that they fear the potential backlash which is a good sign We can actually change this with our voice
Silphet	PLEASE CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU EXPERIENCE DEATH
Sam Korb	I think it would work well so long a there s no way to give a misleading price like a comment mentioned Require that it is the monthly price of the pill and not an individual daily etc price As for the pharma lobbying argument if you re afraid people will be swayed away by the priced of your pill include Price varies based on insurance in your ad It s that simple The argument definitely seems like the company are afraid of having to reduce the price of their drug I d also be in favor of requiring this on social medium and radio at least a a large portion of the population use these and many people are moving away from cable satellite TV and going to streaming
Abby Barbre	I enjoy the new animation stuff
Are we Still doing Phrasing	Do I call after I experience my coma or death
Matthew Eden	It will be interesting to see what kind of difference this make but I wouldn t be too hopeful Many drug manufacturer have program to get their drug for an affordable price with valid insurance and for a limited time Earlier this year a prescription I d been taking for over a year leapt in price from 15 to 14 000 for a 3 month supply Even the generic wa over 150 a month Prices like these are absurd and we need an institution to have leverage and control these price People s health shouldn t be abused for profit nor should it even be legal to do so
Eipa	I don ’ t think it will do anything at all but at least it ’ s something
Angry Corn	I think this is a good thing It won ’ t end phrma corruption altogether but it ’ s a good step to start
ninthundertow	My Lyrica is over 660 a month Now it is covered under my insurance but that said it s covered Most people don t pay cash price So why put people off a medication even if it s better and will be covered I totally agree that this will confuse consumer The drug that saved my life is 77 000 a dose but if I hadn t taken it I would have died However that drug wa covered under a trial that the drug company paid for They aren t horrible people like they are almost always made out to be

BaldeBalde SaPagkaPogi	Not gon na work apple blatantly ha their price up front and there s no direct evidence or any evidence at all that this made them to even consider lowering their price What make you think it would be any different for pres drug when pres drug are more in demand than an iphone If anything this might just lead to le development of really useful medicine because pharma would just focus on drug that they can post with low enough price to attract customer the end result would just worsen the development of drug with fewer side effect
Templaric Legion	It s a step in the right direction but unfortunately we re only at the first step of a 6 story building
Foxy brown	For the first time in a long while I m on the government side for this one Pharmaceutical company need to drop their price They push so many drug down our country s throat and they NEED to be more transparent

Luke Lambert	Hi all I m from New Zealand we have no commercial or advertising prescription drug Whilst we only pay between 5 dollar to 2 50 per prescription depending on whereyou a we have a government subsidy
That0Homeless0Guy	In the republic of Ireland med can still be fairly pricey but the state ha a strong position due to it s socilaised medical system While they cap the the price of medicine they also hold alot of negotiation power over the price they pay for medicine they distribute through th healtcare system a any person with a medical card pay €1 or €2 for almost any prescription for all basic medication This also mean the private medical industry ha to compete somewhat with public medical supply Not saying it s perfect a it ha some serious issue that even the leading psychologist of the mental health board just gave up and quit out of frustration at how poor the system is but I pretty much never concerned about cost of medicine
Marky Mark	You should comment on the youtube outage that happened on October 16th
MATthew Bartell	cover that story about taylor swift giving that family money it s rad
Selina Fox	for those of you that need a little help you can go to goodrx website type in the name of your drug and the quantity and then it will list all the store in your area and how much your medicine will cost just print out the coupon and that s all you ll pay you can t use the coupon AND your insurance however so if you have a high deductible then the cost will not go against your deductible if you use the coupon
Jeff Taylor	Seeing this title i got the sinking feeling of of God what are they taking away now I do think this would be good to create some competition but the pricing is an issue Our insurance system creates this industry with almost no set standard price I remember the video of the guy with no insurance calling the hospital to find it the cost of having a baby and no one could give him even an estimate My wife is a surgical nurse and based on how they do thing the same surgery could cost very different amount based on the patient and even doctor preference They count and charge thing a they go there is no set standard for what or how much will be used
Dueling Duelist Drew	I like the new editing good job
somethingelseishere	The FDA truly is an evil organization They get people hooked on poisonous food while they re young and uninformed and they become addicted pumping sugar into the food supply it s in everything and it IS addictive and then once they start developing illness disease BECAUSE of the food they ve eaten all their life the medication required for said illness are usually priced out of reach What a sick evil thing to do
Amy Wallis	Well what might help lower price the most would be showing the international cost of some prescription medicine to the American price For example I suffer from asthma and take several medication morning and night every day and have since I wa a child One of these is my Ventolin inhaler which with a prescription in Italy cost about 2€ and without one cost about 4€ In America it cost anywhere between 50 and 100 Is that normal No It isn t In Ireland where medication is considered one of the most expensive in Europe it cost about 6 10€ Remember that this is daily medication which is necessary for asthmatic for the entirety of their life unless a miracle cure for asthma come about

808jayhawk	I think this is a great first step in the right direction
Gumble Gob	It is not the government s job to regulate the economy The government can t just go around telling people what to price their product at that s communist bullshit A price ceiling on prescription drug will only increase demand and decrease supply creating an artificial shortage Companies won t sell a much of their product if they can t make a profit LET THE MARKET REGULATE ITSELF
daaper	The fact that the pharma lobby ha a problem with this because the price can vary so wildly based on insurance coverage doesn t make this a bad initiative Instead it highlight the major issue with our current healthcare system
ggggidid	I m not a trump fan and I make no secret of this in my day to day life but I really like this move and am super behind the administration this time

Rocker Peter	We need more morning video Ya beautiful bastard
SG Gamers	Just ask a Pharmacist about cheaper drug alternative It is LITERALLY their job to know Because your Doctor ha zero clue seriously It s why Pharmacists go to University and work in that specific field while Doctors a more broader field only offhand know a handful of brand when prescribing medication But it is the Pharmacists who know the brand and their alternative competitor I asked my pharmacist when I wa diagnosed a diabetic and she switched me to generic brand of what my doctor prescribed and the price dropped from nearly 100 a month down to only 30 Always just think of medication a Doctors diagnose the problem Pharmacists find the proper treatment
ADDISON396	Hey Memology 1O1 wave
Austin Harsh	I ve always thought it s bizarre that drug company advertise on TV I mean what are you going to do See an ad for Lipitor and run to your doctor demanding he writes you a script for it even though you don t have any health issue related to the drug
Anahata	If the government is forcing company to give the consumer more information about their product yea I ’ m all for that
Skywardocarina1	I don t see this making drug company lower price BUT I think this is something that ha needed to be done for a long time so people are completely informed Instead of having to go and actually pick up the prescription to find out if you can afford it or not you will be able to know ahead of time and at least attempt to find an alternative with your doctor on the first visit instead of having to go back after finding out you can t afford it
TentaclePentacle	When will trump stop winning I m so sick of winning already
Charlescham3	Why cant we just tell people to take drug or eat healthy exercise and stay away from negatively 326 billion spent by the USA How much would universal healthcare cost if the pharmaceutical company could no longer advertise on TV Would that be the only way to get universal healthcare

Teth47	But why allow drug company to advertise directly to consumer Consumers aren t medically trained they don t know how to factor side effect into their treatment nor even what those side effect actually mean in many case Not to mention the fact that advertising medication to a nation of borderline hypochondriac is a great way to amplify those feeling leading to more drug spending than is often necessary a well a the social pressure that many drug advertisement put on people to get medicated for thing that really don t matter Rogaine anyone The first amendment doe not extend to harmful practice If I mislead you about something which is what these advertisement are literally designed to do a much a legally allowed I get in trouble The first amendment doe not cover lie neither of substance nor omission

ding dong	United States No United Scam The sound like a good news story but the US always ha hidden motif
Zayneakajordan	I have never thought of getting a drug because of a drug advertisement I have only gotten an rx because my doctor said I would because of my chief complaint of why I am visiting her But I am all for forcing the drug company to show their price There ’ s no harm and wouldn ’ t cost them any extra money I also think imposing fine for company that don ’ t comply are fine It ’ s not a free speech issue either I mean look at how fast food company were forced to put calorie on the menu when your order It ’ s not a free speech violation because corporation are not people That ’ s a piss poor defense
C.J	GO TRUMP
Corey Slade	I m curious about how this would work exactly there is Sort of A MSRP type price point for expensive prescription drug but in my experience working for a Patient Assistance Program doing insurance investigation that price ha almost no relation to what the out of pocket cost is for the patient Each insurance company and pharmacy negotiated their own price for the drug essentially in bulk and then in some case they use that price a the out of pocket price sometimes they figure it out some other way e g Not all place pas along the discount like Costco doe Having worked with medication that went for anywhere from 600 to 28 000 month the MSRP value could be either almost exactly right or off by thousand in either direction
Samantha Kauffman	It s an interesting concept considering that I wa diagnosed a bi polar and one of my medication that wa prescribed to me wa Latuda you showed that commercial in your video and WITH heath insurance it cost me 300 and without would be a little over 1000 So I don t know if and how the government should step in or if this should be a conversation between the patient and doctor TLDR Don t wan na pay 300 a month for drug I need
Dan	4 54 Rachel who
Andrew D	Honestly I don ’ t think prescription drug should be advertised on or social medium
Jack McAllan	If you need a drug your doctor will prescribe it That argument by drug company is ridiculous and demonstrates what s wrong with the whole system Your doctor should be the one that determines treatment and explains the process and option to you Not drug ad and not drug company paying off that doctor to prescribe expensive and potentially le effective product when better or cheaper option exist Advertising drug make drug more expensive because ad are extremely expensive So bite the bullet and ban advertisement If Americans truly want cheaper prescription the first step is outright banning ad The next step is socialised healthcare The reason medical treatment is cheap in the UK is because there s a board that decides which medical treatment equipment drug get the monopoly That mean medical company have to substantially reduce cost to be in the running If they lose their bid hardly any of their product will ever be used in that whole of the UK It still ha a chance a an alternative for people who have allergy or reaction to the chosen product but that s still an overall loss And it s not that the cheapest option always win If another product is more efficient even if it cost more it ll win the bid but again they have to have substantially reduced cost to even be considered That s an intense competition That s serious capitalism at work for all the socialized healthcare hater It s an all or nothing competition and it work in people s favour That s why the exact same treatment in the UK cost significantly le There s no difference in the treatment there s just no money wasted by company having to pay off hospital and doctor to be the product of choice or spend billion on advertising Of course the product they then sell to people are going to cost a lot more they have a lot of money to cover just getting that product into the game and they re a business they still have to make a profit
Dem	How do I feel Extremely surprised Pleasantly so Regardless of the rest of his choice Trump is best known for his capitalism so something like this seems surprising with his name on it Trump hasn t been a bad a the campaign chaos forecast but I hope this most is big enough that the left and right can finally agree on something and start to have more meaningful conversation As an aside I kept thinking to write I hope they make the same change here but keep remembering phil said only two place show those ad on TV I honestly didn t know that wa a thing As a Canadian so much of our medium is American that I don t even know what s what anymore I see one of those drug ad every time I watch a bit of TV
Margaret	I ’ ve talked about this for year and people have dismissed me thank you for addressing this I hope this can move change forward👍⭐️
cjpitch	It s funny they say consumer might avoid a certain drug because or the price on TV how about you stop pushing consumer to ask about a certain drug Let the doctor do their job If the ad continue which I m sure they will they SHOULD include pricing I m saying this a someone who used to work in big pharma I think they should put the price per pill in the commercial 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 When high deductible health plan were initially created the insurance company who came up with them used the phrase consumer driven healthcare The idea being consumer would be more active in seeking lower cost option ie incentivizing going to the doctor office or urgent care rather than the er Or choosing a generic rather than the brand when allergy aren t an issue Big pharma wa involved in that They can t come back and argue that consumer shouldn t be informed about their own healthcare cost
LadyZubat	I can save the drug company a lot of pain depending on your Heath insurance your cost could be a low a a month No headache
Uhohhotdog Gaming	How about banning drug commercial instead Money spent on commercial is increasing the price of the drug I ’ m not giving trump or anyone else any positive credit for this
Calvin’ LaVictoire	I love the video and the topic Totally think this is a great step in the right direction
Carson Voss	I think the Trump administration is trying to use this a a cover or a distraction For myself and probably the vast majority of Americans who take a daily prescription it s easy to say that it s a move in the right direction but I think it s a much more calculated move than it would appear at a glance If prescription drug cost go down that will likely have an impact on the overall annual out of pocket cost of healthcare but I m certain that it s intended to reduce the outrage that ensues when the administration try to further gut and dismantle the Affordable Care Act The only impressive thing that this administration ha done is to build several house of card simultaneously Things will come toppling down a these band aid fix and cover ups start to fall apart and thing like prescription drug price are going to rebound hard when they do
nicodabastard	The government s around the world should start there own drug company and medical research company ffs make job and lower price of drug and probably cure disease instead of just profiting from them
Jack Hughes	I hate Trump but I m glad he s doing this
Phoenix Fire	Transparency is good Not enough
Tanker J	The shame aspect isn t going to work for this plan Remember the pen that keep people alive when they re severely allergic to thing going to 1 000 per dose People were outraged but the company didn t lower the price for over a year I think it took the ceo of the company to go to jail and a new ceo to take over before they lowered the price I think a generic also came out about the same time but it s still very expensive for the name brand So I don t think shaming will work on these greedy company
Noh Body	What I am hearing is that drug company will still price these life saving medicine out reach for the VAST majority of people but the people will know just how much out of reach Because it s not like we aren t angry enough
Bath House Becky	Look I appreciate the effort being made here hope it all work out for the sake of the people but they ’ re only going to display price on cable tv Doesn ’ t that seem a little shady Like a “ here take this peasant now stop bitching ” type of deal I say this because the majority of US citizen don ’ t have cable instead opt for online streaming So who ’ s going to see these ad The 5 senior citizen left who still pay for cable
GhostlyHoots	Those ad are in canada too
Omnom Bacon	The out of pocket cost should be listed That s the actual price of the drug You can have a discussion with your insurance provider to see how much of that they ll pick up and what you ll actually have to pay but cheaper generic equivalent should be promoted more than a stupid brand name Between hospital and drug company scamming insurance we pay more than any other first world nation for healthcare and don t even get the best healthcare Why Because they can get away with it Personally I d love to see more regulation around pricing Free market is bullshit when you re selling something that people may need to live

Puma Cheyenne	Section 255 5 of the FTC guideline for paid endorsement very clearly state When there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product that might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement i e the connection is not reasonably expected by the audience such connection must be fully disclosed
FuckNuggectMegee	I hate Trump with a passion and what he s doing to trans people right now and this may not even get price to lower but this is a start
ibtrollinya69	Wow never thought I ’ d see something like this come from this administration
Savage Dawgs Highlights	I ’ d be okay with the price being in the ad I work at a pharmacy and every time I see a drug advertised on tv I look it up in the order system the next day never ha there been one le than 800 just for the pharmacy to get but it ’ s okay The doctor will give a coupon that will take the cost down to 25 “ if used with insurance first ” and most insurance won ’ t pay for it so then it only discount this 800 about 30 and the pharmacy worker get yelled at lol I say get rid of drug rep offering doctor incentive for prescribing their drug a well A lot of stuff is getting prescribed because the doctor will get a benefit in some way completely ignoring the customer will never be able to afford the medication It ’ s a sad business but that ’ s why I ’ m getting out a soon a I can lol
Jeremy Moore	Love the morning PDS Great vid
ELEVATOR OF HELL	Fuck phrama fuck phrama
Bring me Peter pan	Wait America is one of only two country that can advertise directly to the consumer What about Canada I see I ad for drug all the time like heart medication and psychiatric drug
Thatdrumdude	I don t know if it s going to reduce price however I do fully support this move by the president and largely consider this to be a good move and win in his book This the requirement of streaming service to pay the artist properly and the USMCA are all really good thing It can not be said that his presidency wa a complete failure Now the only thing I really want to see him do is to make a huge move to improve infrastructure in this country by creating more job specifically tailored to improve our nation s infrastructure Something we desperately need If Trumps can accomplish this particular task I ll vote for him in the next election It s my biggest issue concern It s a topic every candidate talk about but not a single one since I ve been alive ha actually attempted to take action on
JP/AOC Productions	9
Antonio Lopez	I think ad for informational resions to educate about illness can be okay Especially if get people to go get checked out if they think they got something not that I want hypochondriac just enough where oh if I or a love one is showing sings of something better safe then sorry go get checked Then written on screen or said quickly a posable medicine your doctor msy give you The way it on here in the USA mskes all the flow and problem you bought up Phil Hope the change can help a intended I get genric version if available and my doctor give me coupon for only brand name available medicine they give me
George Morgan	Death may become permanent interesting I wa not aware this wa optional
Manni Crump	Whoa really Phill the like button let u know I liked it 😮 who would have thought Jk phill ♡
Lux is Dead \ killerkweer	All the confusion the drug company are worried about can be avoided by adding price may vary depending on insurance
shineq	As an European I ’ m still baffled that advertising prescription drug is a thing in the US
lawszepie	not a trump fan but got ta say this is absolutely amazing Even if it doesnt lower the price increasing the transparency is always good for the consumer
DefyLov3	LETS TALK ABOUT BETTER HELP
Richard Peck	If the company are complaining then it might work At least they are doing something about it Maybe banning add and making doctor kick back illegal would help
Nathanator 19	I think specific price would be the best thing but price listing is a step in the right direction As a personal rule I feel that if a company say they will police themselves they won t This is why I don t fully trust that organisation that said pharma company have agreed to say they will list pricing
Jessica SmokeyMcPot	I am 100 against Trump and everything he stand for but good on his administration for doing this Big pharma charge insane price far more than what they need to for them to make a nice profit then they use that money to influence our government The le money big pharma can extort from u the better I m very surprised the Trump administration is taking this stance but it s a nice surprise
Sin	It should be illegal for drug company to advertise in the first place With that said making people more aware of the price is meaningless People don t buy drug because they re convenient People buy the drug their doctor prescribes because they are sick and want to be healthy
Amy Duong	Why doe he say 50 dollar drug like it s cheap wtf is up with American health care
Goodnight	The reason Epi pen fell and competitor rose wa BECAUSE of the shaming for the ridiculous pricing I dislike the trump administration but this proposal is very good for consumer
moplum	This will not affect drug company because they have no ethic no shame They brag that they charge their high price because they can My concern ha been why doesn t our government enforce our current price gouging law It is price gouging American citizen with extreme drug charge when the rest of the planet pay ten time le for the same exact prescription I think this new so called law to advertise price is a political smoke screen All it will do is removed some TV drug advertisement yet still charge unadvertised astronomical price to Americans
Prince Harris	Funny how some say they will vote for Trump because of this one thing yet ignore all the other shady and bad thing he ha done and said a well a thing he ha outright lied about IfYouDon tStandForSomethingYoullFallForAnything
Elena Rossa Garai	I spend around 120 00 monthly on prescription I think this is an overall good move I m hopeful it will work to some benefit I m really not a Trump supporter but negotiating and sometimes bullying into deal is something he s more experienced at than the average person The fact Pharma is already squirming is a good sign in my opinion At the very least I don t see Pharma raising any price soon if they re already worried about it
Kyle BlamedCanada	Got ta know the price before you look to buy something
emulare11	“ coma or death a these may become permanent “ 😅 yeah death tends to be pretty permanent usually 😂
Joe Castor	Prepare for some random death big pharma is gon na put some hit out lol
visiblespectra	9 year of pharmacy experience here None of you know how illiterate the government is to insurance and the health industry Fix or remove PBMs and cut administration seat That s all that need to be done However this is definitely a good move not to mention Trump also signed allowing pharmacist to tell patient cheaper alternative without having legal ramification
Mario D	Hey Philip Im a fan of your show and i wanted to bring to your attention something that happened in Greece A few day ago document where released in the Greek parliament that proved that the greek government wa bribing neighboring country medium company so that they would only report and have debate show that painted the Greek government and Greece a a whole in a positive light regardless of the fact This come at a time when Greece is having important diplomatic talk with 2 of it neighbor Albania and Macedonia regarding the sea border with Albania in witch the wish to have an extra 12 mile of sea in the direction of the Albanian sea border with Macedonia the wish that Macedonia would change it name form Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the republic of Northern Macedonia I thought this would be interesting considering the party in the country aforementioned are under accusation of corruption and in some case treason
Charsept	7 10 Americans have a prescription If that s true that s really shocking to me
Caleb Crow	Anything to disrupt the Pharmaceutical Insurance company racket The reason they are able to keep price so high is that the consumer doesn t see the whole cost Thus this system develops in which you have to have health insurance to afford medical bill because the price are so inflated
shutupjonnie	I ’ m not a big fan of the president but I like this move No matter what the motive behind this could be an educated consumer is a responsible consumer This could be a great move to increase demand for lower cost drug alternative which could lead to lower cost prescription overall Hopefully this help people afford life saving medication and reduce price gouging
The Steadfast Duelist	0 59 These are so fun to binge watch Drug side effect are such a joke
MsAliceVamp	This is a really interesting topic for me because I am studying to be a pharmacy technician I just started my course a couple week ago but I know that this couple really shake thing up What I do know in the pharmacy when a person come in with a prescription unless it is expressly written my the doctor to be a brand name or you refuse to have the therapeutic equivalent generic you will get the generic which is cheaper for you Although not all drug have a generic So if the drug company have to place their price on their ad they could sly and put the price for one pill not one month supply The likely won t include the name of a generic possible because another drug company make it And of course they don t know how much each person s insurance will cover from their price There could also be discount at your pharmacy or online program like GoodRX which can be helpful if you are paying out of pocket Overall I think it could help lower price and start people taking with their doctor about why this medication is this really the right one Are there alternative But in the case of company that don t yet have generic or are the only one making that particular drug i e the incident with the price hike on HIV med and epi pen the company were the one of few if not the only one making these drug therefore people had to buy it in order to keep themselves from dying we might not see much of a change Great video Phil I am going to bring this up to my teacher to get her opinion too Thanks
Ricardo Elejalde	I ’ m a liberal and I know most that share that title have trouble admitting this but I think this is a good thing from the trump administration and ha some potential to help the people out I just don ’ t think out of the list of option they had it wa the option with the most power to change price of prescription It seems like a step in the right direction though
duo1666	It will likely lead to lower price if you increase the actual competition and remove these stupid fucking patent holder for drug Give the people who create the product some benefit of doing so but dont allow them to fucking monopolize an entire treatment
Tyler Saunders	If only America had a system where if the larger business paid a certain amount didn ’ t get large tax cut average people didn ’ t have to pay so much for proscription and cutout certain program that ACTUALLY waste money Where everyone ha the basic healthcare and you could pay for extra insurance from insurance company so you could keep them around But it ’ s America most politician don ’ t actually care about you and it ’ s easy to trick the common person
Michael Vanhaverbeke	Not the best solution it s more than any other administration ha done in at least 30 year
BigHeadClan	Doubt there will be any change to drug price but if it work then sweet you guy down South pay waaay to much for your prescription
Jaizensama Sosek’e	Why not just make health care a right
Nito 🔥	This is a good move but there those who will say why are prescription drug so expensive in the first place I think people especially Americans take for granted just how difficult expensive it is to design manufacture drug for consumer use Some people would say it should be free or low cost but in reality you can ’ t have your cake eat it too Albeit some pharmaceutical company really jack up price in order to maximize profit for themselves Mylan the Epipen come to mind but a solid majority need to recoup fund in order to move on to developing the next form of treatment Again I think this is good move that give a bit more transparency to consumer but I also think that consumer are shortsighted in their scope of how pharmaceutical work
truMalma	Finally someone trying to tackle this massive problem This is more idea for solution that I have heard in a lifetime when it come to big pharma
scohspot	Drug company have no legit medical reason to advertise prescription drug to consumer in the first place They are trying to get customer to request the drug knowing that patient are scared and a doctor is likely to cave to their request Financially speaking there is no reason for drug company to lower price even if requiring advertise the price All they ’ d need to do is add a line saying “ some insurance policy cover up to XX of the price of this drug check with your insurance to see what your price will be ” And most customer would write off the price to insurance If we banned advertising to customer that will immediately cut out unnecessary spending by drug company Next we should look into how generic drug are treated by patent holder Third switch to single payer healthcare so there is a customer who can actually negotiate against the drug company and win
Ethan Pegouske	The editing in this video wa pretty good however I think you might want to simplify it a bit This just sound like any disembodied voice speaking over some fancy editing Maybe try to show your face a little bit more like the regular video
Thromnabular	Why is Trump literally the best President ever
Stu H	Yes yes and yes I say a big yes to the cost on all ad not just TV Big Pharma can swallow their own pill
Furrnox	I m suprised yet not surprised I m surprised the Trump administration is doing anything at all but yet not suprised since Trump have to garner some popularity point with everyone except Republicans so it s a good move for him it s also kind of a non action approach because it won t force the pharma company to do much yet Trump can say he battled the pharma company in speech etc
Matt Katch	I don t think this will be super effective in getting company to lower price but at the same time I like the idea a a first measure to making American medicine more transparent and affordable
Vincent Ianniello	This feel like a trojan horse and by that I mean that it look good but isn t at all On paper I can see how this read well to Republicans a it not really directly infringing on company bottom line but it is increasing competition I actually agree with the Pharma company that adding the price to the commercial is pretty much useless As it is Insurance company barter for better price so that affect how much you the watcher of the commercial would end up paying for it and that fact render the listed price essentially useless unless you don t have any insurance and pay for drug entirely on your own A far better idea to increase competition and decrease price would be to disallow advertising on medium for pharma company 10 minute of watching those commercial will tell you why they are predatory and removing them would mean that it on your doctor to inform you about different medication or on the consumer to do their own research and talk to their doctor about option The bad side of that would be that if the government did nothing else after disallowing ad then Pharma company would likely pump all that ad money into salesperson and bombard doctor to prescribe their drug instead of others so that would need to be addressed in some way but even with that potential I still think it much better to just stop Pharma from being able to advertise on medium just like we did with Smoking company decade ago Ultimately this just seems like the Trump administration trying to have their cake keeping the promise to deal with pharma to their base while eating it to maintaining the profit margin of Pharma company
Zuny Caballero	Loved this video thank you sir
Raquel Rusu	IF this actually passed Trump would actually be like truly a epic president I can t believe he actually want to follow up on supporting average american I m scared that i m getting my hope up again after Obama
Beemer	I think when it come to these ad you are seeing on TV the reason they are making so much money is because consumer are telling their doctor they want the drug rather than asking whether or not it s the right choice for them While most doctor would tell you that it s not the right medication I can imagine there are a ton of people telling their doctor that they experience the symptom and the medication look the best for them so in order to stop arguing with the patient the doctor simply prescribes the drug for them It s one of my biggest pet peeve when someone go into the doctor s office to tell them what prescription they need Instead the assumption should be that the doctor who went to school for 8 year to help you with the exact reason why you re visiting them a a job probably know better than you do about what medication you should take With this law it would change the discussion from I know what I need and it s this medication I saw on TV to I know I want this medication on TV but it s really expensive That would allow the doctor to more easily suggest a different medication that could cost le The unfortunate reality of the situation is that people care more about their money than their own well being If they go to the doctor without considering the cost of the medication they want will be then they re more likely to fight the doctor for it because who doesn t want to live the lavish lifestyle presented on TV If they are looking for knowledge when they enter because they can t really afford the medication they saw on TV the doctor can then a lot easier persuade you into buying the kind of medicine that would not only better fit your symptom but would also be cheaper This could help a ton when it come to the medication reducing their price because they wouldn t be making a much from the commercial and in an effort to keep advertising their medicine but making it affordable to the average person they d lower it to something actually reasonable I am largely in favor of this law because at the bare minimum it force prescription medicine commercial to be even more informative I think it s dumb we have them in the first place because I don t think any doctor outside of the United States and New Zealand get people who come in to tell them what medicine they want and instead they actually listen to their doctor TL DR Medicines on TV are cool and people will TELL their doctor to prescribe it to them If the price show then they ll inquire a to what is cheaper rather than simply telling the doctor what they think they need I am in favor of the law because people are stupid and commercial for prescription med are dangerous
TheAlaskinKumquat224	Wo0oP Philip
Gikua Ook	I took half of a prescribed ibuprofen and half of an anxiety pill Hydroxyzine this morning and I threw up Remember to eat enough with your pill
Thorski	Pharmaceutical company should not be able to have commercial to begin with If something is potentially deadly to consume say fx Seroquel Not so long ago there wa a company who made Seroquel the company had not tested their product resulting in a lot of people getting worse even leading to suicide If you are worried now you should probably check online what people say about that drug you re described Wouldn t hurt
reallunacy	I find the argent used by the pharmaceutical company that the price may not reflect what you actually pay is a bit silly The more insurance company pay for drug across the market requires them to increase the rate of all of their plan so they continue to make a profit You a a consumer should be very concerned what the full price of a drug is regardless of whether that cost is coming out of your pocket or someone else s
Awesomesauce	This is a good video info wise but I think the editing is kinda bad The transition text animation etc just seem kinda bad I prefer something a little cleaner imo

Joe Jackson	The point is YOU SHOULD NOT NEED INSURANCE TO AFFORD YOUR MEDICATIONS Damn drug company are ripping people off in the USA like you can not believe This shit isnt a huge of an issue overseas
Fatal Foxtrot	something something broken clock
Jordan Young	So for hundred of thousand of year human have survived with out chemical being shoved in our body What worry me the most is how quick we are to take pill than solve our problem I know every case is different and some people should be on prescription drug But if 70 of the population relies on drug and their body become reliant on these drug then 70 of your citizen have a drug problem I don t think putting a price on the tv is a step in the right direction It just tell you how much you ll have to pay for your next fix
Spencer Haynes	I think this is the first time i m happy trump did something
GruesomeToucan	I never thought I d say this but I m with Trump on this one lol
Charles Fish	While showing the price is good and all the price of prescription in the US compared to other country is insane This is hardly that great of a move It s piecemeal at best and a show of good intention that have no teeth Also another reason to have universal healthcare like other modern country
Place holder name is place holder	1 08 coma or death these may become permanent
James Cogswell	I despise Trump on most issue but this is a very good policy plan Credit where credit ’ s due
BtkSabora	the price that is listed need to be the direct cost of manufacture not the inflated price for profit they need to be required to give u access to the audit a well so we can see what the money is they are receiving over cost especially if there is no generic alternative
EXcentricSAM	what doe this change they are only using these rule for TV ad but if they are on social medium they are not required to i wonder where most Americans get their information from hmmmm it seems that the president and his cabinet are proposing a lot of bill that they seem to think are popular and some that are at least trying to do good right before mid term what happens if they don t win there is a good possibility this is gon na be a weapon for the potus to use during midterm
Alitza Vazquez	Easy solution Put the price of the drug assuming that the person watching the commercial ha no health insurance and put in a notation that the price can very dependent upon your insurance I remember at one point when I wa really sick and my medication ended up costing me over 1000 a month but because of my health insurance I only paid 5 buck
The Boy Icarus	I think that this is a great move Increases in transparency for an industry that involves 70 of the American population Not a Trumpie and I am very critical of him and his administration a good bit of the time but I like this move and agree with it wholeheartedly
Morgan Daniels	Love the vid Phil Keep them coming As for the subject we should ban all pharmaceutical advertising ad And I am in advertising It is inappropriate Medical recommendation should always come from your doctor Let them market to the doctor
Curtis Andersen	Keep up the good work Loving the morning show
Gamer McGameface	Commercials for drug exactly like this are also on Canadian airwave
Ken Baik	They need to do this with hospital cost for operation Not everyone work for a big company or government There are still people who pay for private insurance and have to pay almost everything out of pocket
Someone	coma low blood pressure death and ligma
Melo	This seems like a step in the right direction but to be honest I don t think it doe all that much What would really make a difference is price comparing or seeing the cost of different drug If I see an ad for a drug and think maybe I should take that and then see it s expensive I m just going to change my mind and probably wont even consider that there are generic option Also if they are so worried about the fact that the price varies by insurance then the ad can just say that Next to the price it can say something like This price may change based on your insurance See our website for further detail They can direct to a website and still list the price
Dana Vixen	Why disclose this stuff on only TV ad The rate of people watching TV are on the decline to be more in favor of online entertainment outlet and they appear to be left out according to this video
JussmiiofW.B.	Canada also ha those ad
Jessica V	I feel this need to be extended to medical facility too I think they should have a menu telling patient how much thing are going to cost them not just do thing and surprise them on the bill later
micah feldman	There is so much i hate about the trump administration mainly about him but if this lead to price decrease in med it would drastically change my opinion especially if it help lower the price of drug people need to live especially insulin a it is basically held hostage at exorbadent price which cause the death of massive number of type 1 and type 2 diabetic and i seriously hope this help change this for my sister type 1 and all of the others who deal with insane price hike by pharmaceutical company
Geoff Roach	If this happens then great something Trump did that wa right for once and if it becomes an actual policy then great I ll give credit to Trump
ziah Reid	This is all about trying to make the republican party look good for the midterm election I doubt trump and his crony are going to follow through with much of what they are proposing Hillary wouldn t have either The pharmaceutical industry is so wealthy and powerful they re stuffing money in the pocket of every major politician out there If they actually succeed in substantially lowering the cost of medication and making prescription drug price more transparent then I ll buy a maga hat
Gardner De Aguiar	To equate purchasing prescription drug to that of buying a car is comparing apple to orange As well this move simply is not enough I d say it s merely tossing a bone at the problem This is a healthcare issue something Trump intentionally ignores
mrvvinston	imo private business have absolutely zero room to be in the pharmaceutical industry it truly is immoral and unethical to charge people money for life saving medication the healthcare system in the u is disgusting and need to be changed asap
Viatemar	Let s be real here They re already in on it lobby folk and trump the only one s who dont know whack are the citizen or people who re not in on it They just care bout money and with time changing and the interwebz becoming more popular it s just a move from the pharmacy to get from television into the internet so they still don t have to tell how much their drug cost while they still reach enough people to benefit from also more space in television for the company to display other stuff for those of em who still care about tv they just raised their voice cause you expect them to say at least something about it a if they really give a damn
1caboose1	I think if tobacco company can t advertise to naive child than farma company can t advertise to naive adult

Lord Leto	Death might be permanent Since when
Jose Landa	Awww 👎 such a let down to start with out bein called a beautiful bastard lol where will i get my daily boost in self esteem
kpowers74	TV ad Who the fuk watch TV Lose
mypastlife	Because we allow drug company to act a a for profit business it is much more likely that they will just increase the cost of lower priced medication and tout the idea that all drug cost high price and issuance is the reason you pay lower so to just normalize high pricing This will just lead to a closer relationship with drug company and issuance company to price hike everything so both can suddenly find them self in record breaking number You want to lower price you call it what it is a public health concern and the same with health cost and health insurance and cap what they can charge Or you outright just put them in government control where the US say the health and safety of our citizen come first If you pay tax you are covered
Anipix	buy prescription drug lol what
rayuu	i see a lot of people discussing how drug shouldnt be advertised on tv but i wan na be honest even if youre not directly interested in that drug i think it s a good thing that they show these symptom of issue to people nation wide and truly open people eye to an issue they might have and can get professional help for i wouldve never known the reason why my boyfriend wa always so tired despite a good night rest and everything else he had wa due to sleep apnea if i hadn t heard about it in my psychology class and brought it up to him when we hear about these thing sometimes it just truly cause that click in your mind and motivates you to fix that issue also on the topic of this act i think it s really good a long a it stay transparent and isnt abused or ha area open to misleading but pharmacuetical company probably will try and find a way and likely succeed in making the price tempting even if in the end theyre wasting more than expected

anthony harvey	most regulation is stupid this is smart legislation big win for trump requiring infomation to be presented in an add is a great way for competition to say we are cheeper
Deven McKee	I think at the very least this could go a long way to highlight the ridiculous collusion between insurance and pharmaceutical company If this go through we ll begin to see all of their price magically fall while out of pocket expense for patient remain the same Insurance company dont pay ticket price for these medication The ticket price is often an inflated nonsense number that s designed to make the insurance company feel like they are getting a discount I imagine that pharmaceutical company will simply start listing something closer to the actual price that they charge to insurance company but consumer will end up footing the same old bill The upside is that consumer without insurance or with really terrible coverage will probably pay a bit le

The Scouting Mama	The mar mg st ha changed so much this year This make it so much harder to just get the med my husband need for his pain He ha 5 bulging disc and he is working then last month he fell down the stair at work and broke 2 rib All of the change over the last year have made Dr s even pain management Dr s afraid to help people with pain At the beginning of the year the pain Dr had to drop everyone s pain med down a level and keep it there weather the med are working or not Maybe you should talk about that type of change
Gena G	Lobbyists say they can t post the price because the type of insurance the consumer ha may cause those price to differ when they can just say that in the ad The cost of this prescription without insurance is x individual price may vary depending on your insurance They can add it in with the ridiculous amount of side effect I think they re just making excuse to keep charging boatload
Emilio Reyes	A Republican Conservative who asking for transparency from a boj private company WHAT WORLD AM I LIVING IN

Christopher Wingo	You are surprised that Trump said he wanted something done then he did it Unlike the last several president this president say AND keep his promise and declaration You should look into this and do a show about it I bet it would be eye opening how little past leader did to keep their word Contrast that with the amount that our president ha kept
Bullet1520	WHOA trump actually doing something notably helpful to the country O o what s the catch

Bec SocSci	Trump you are a legend still I love you
JackWolfGaming	Shame doesn t fight greed It never ha Money is the most powerful motivator for the corrupt Anybody that fight this attempt to lower price is greedy It ha nothing to do with freedom of speech It ha everything to do with freedom of economy

funfreakingtastic	im extremely anti trump but this would be a great move i hope with these change it incentive big pharma to lower price on their drug
sluttyMapleSyrup	RE Pharma lobbyist claim of confusion It s an insult to their consumer It s not hard to look at the price of a drug then ask your insurance company how much of that price they ll cover Claiming that showing the listing price of the drug in it ad will cause confusion about the price is basically saying Our consumer are too stupid to do even simple math or call the guy they re paying that can do the math for them RE Trump s involvement This is good I can t stand Trump a a person and have not seen him do anything worthy of praise but he s actually on the right side of this issue at the moment and that s great
Mason Brown	Love these morning Videos Thank you Phil and team
Jedidiah oyeyemi	It doe nothing if you still have no say in the price and can either pay or die

Darren Middleton	thanks for the extra spot today please keep them keep them coming
Eric	Why not ban pharmaceutical ad aimed at patient
fyrye	Trump should know the proposed rule will have little to no actual impact on the manufacturer aside from increasing their legal and advertising cost to display the pricing Corporations already know or can obtain their competitor pricing on alternative to their product So a for making pricing more competitive at the manufacturer level it s just smoke and mirror For the consumer knowing the price of the prescription drug from the manufacturer we should all know about MSRP and when we purchase a product from the retailer it is generally le than or equal to the advertised MSRP dependant on the retailer So again not much of a change from the existing system As for obtaining a prescription for one drug or an alternative such a generic we are already given the option either from our doctor or pharmacist so again not much change If anything the new rule will mainly harm retailer Forcing them to match or lower their pricing from the MSRP Causing earned profit by the retailer to be le and leaving the drug manufacturer pricing a they already are If anything doctor should be the one that are required to disclose pricing of the drug they prescribe and their viable alternative
Julian Cavaleri	Not a fan of Trump but it sound pretty good
KurtBob	Leading people to your website for the pricing total BS
Wright Family	I m very surprised that the Trump administration is taking move against a huge industry like Big Pharma He s always been very pro business so I find this move legitimately interesting I myself have four prescription and no health insurance but I only buy generic and I have a discount card at my pharmacy I haven t looked into how difficult it may be for others to buy generic drug or how the price of the name brand drug affect the price of the generic alternative I ve also never seen a drug on TV and said Oh I should look into that mostly because I trust my doctor and I m already on a stable suite of medication I guess my main thing is I never understood TV advertising of specific drug because the only thought I d have while watching those commercial is Oh Treatment for my condition exists I should ask my doctor about a drug that solves my issue but I don t think I d ever request a drug by name based on a commercial All of my prescription are very trial and error because they work differently for different people birth control anti depressive etc I would never immediately assume that the one on TV is the one that would work best
MyRedmamba	Kind of hard to call your doctor if you re in a coma I d love to see the look on doctor face when they get a call from someone dead
yippykiay13	Way I see it either it will lead them to lower price or it won ’ t As a person who suffers from epilepsy who NEEDS medication but can ’ t afford insurance I have no sympathy for the company that want to charge me 120 for the medication I need to not have a seizure If it wasn ’ t for coupon I ’ d be screwed

DesolatorMagic	Before ANYONE get almost any kind of prescription try getting 8 hour of sleep exercise regularly and don t eat garbage and see if the symptom go away Pills are not a magic solution for your crappy life choice
alienmediapro	PhRMA s reason for pushing back are what s misleading Just list the MSRP for the 30 day supply with the follow up statement Check with your insurance provider to determine actual out of pocket cost or similar What is misleading about that truth is they don t want to be transparent
Erick Ignacio	Bro more video will always be appreciated Keep being awesome
Jack Chase	First Trump move I ve liked since the summit
Nathan Wurtz	I like the presentation and visuals
Danielle Mathews	Over all this sound like a good move Honestly it feel like prescription drug shouldn t even be advertised or on the market if not well vetted Normal drug like Tylenol Advil or the like that are well known fine to advertise if still needing to remind people to much is bad however a lot of these new drug for illness I would think one should already be talking with a doctor if they have in the first place don t even seem advertise ready I mean talk with your doctor for this drug can cause coma or death and these can CAN become permanent Wow Why is that even being advertised on TV I m tried of feeling like people are paying to be test subject So I see this a a step Not only in price but maybe in getting more conversation a foot hold for more I hope positive change
Scarlett Tears	In theory it seems like a good idea im all for making healthcare more available and all that jazz but there is a reason for drug company price Im guessing mendicant aren t extremely easy or cheap to produce so by forcing company to lower their price you risk getting what youre paying for so to speak because if the price are lower it more costly for the company to produce so you might end up with medication with more side effect or unknown ingredient
thebluebirdsings8	Thanks for posting this It s really interesting that this administration is putting forth this type of legislation regulation forward
Sputterbugz	D R U G S
cjfelldownagain	It s so weird that America advertises drug Shouldn t your doctor know what to give you Why should the patient have to diagnose themselves and tell doctor what they need Why even have doctor in the case

vballguitar	I prefer these way more than the regular show
SashJ	Not a fan of Trump but this is a brilliant move on his part
Ty Jorgensen	The argument that the consumer isn t paying for it but rather the the insurance company that s bogus bull poop Insurance is crazy high because of this type of thinking We ARE paying for it Lower pharmaceutical cost will lead to lower insurance premium and even if they don t it will contribute to informed decision and consumer transparency
DePhantasia	i feel the base price without insurance is what they should focus on in an advertisement adding in a price may vary depending on what insurance you have remark somewhere a well
ik0uw00t	Lower price and make them transparent
Rick Glasser	I ’ m a little confused how doe revealing the information the bill proposes pharmaceutical company to reveal go against the First Amendment
Some Guy	ORANGE MAN BAD
Walter Bunn	This will have zero impact on cost Here s Why It run counter to how medicine in the USA work A doctor who change the drug that is prescribed based purely on cost is guilty of malpractice There ha to be some other factor involved in order for a doctor to alter what they prescribe because if the something happens even if it s not a liability issue that make them liable for financial damage there s actually a legal requirement for them to be able to defend why they re prescribing a particular medicine If a doctor can t defend why they prescribed one drug over another that s ground for removing their prescriptive ability if not their actual medical license on a state by state basis Drug patent right and collective bargaining are what specifically need to be adjusted in the USA Not advertising law
Casey Crowley	what happened to the defranco now show
Cera Man	This is actually a very smart and considerate move on Trump ’ s part Proves that he see Americans a a little bit more than dollar sign at the least Good move by the administration
Natalie Westwood	Solving capitalism with capitalism What a time to be alive
Christi Marie	I take med for my arthritis that are listed at over 1000 month but I have a copay card and I get them for free I think listing a high price like that could totally dissuade patient from getting drug they need even though copay card are pretty easy to get for people who truly need the medicine I ’ d like to see decommercialization of medicine a a whole but it would be a long and arduous process to get there
Grace van der Veen	I think the drug company will eventually crack to the rule and have to publicly show their price and a more and more company show their price depending on what they are priced at they might go down but not likely
Jay S	No notification not surprised
Lindsey Caldow	THIS IS BATSHIT CRAZY TO ME I live in Scotland and prescription are free paid for via tax through the NHS I know it s different in England when you pick up a prescription you pay a flat fee whether you have one item or fifteen item you pay the same amount If thats still how it work I m sure someone can correct me if it s not but I couldn t imagine going to my doctor and having to discus the price of a medicine before it s prescribed to me I work in pharmacy too so I understand how much some medicine can cost
Patrick Sweetman	Phil what tartan is that on your shirt
Bill	Not gon na lie phil This video seems so out of place When there are policy that gut the healthcare or banking or financial or police system and hurt consumer I don t see you focus in like this Don t get me wrong I WANT this level of focus but u never do this for anything else on the main channel I hope I am misunderstanding this move and this will be the first of many and a new normal where you dive into many other specific policy that are both helpful AND harmful to the consumer worker citizen

Shane R	Phil and Crew I always watch but rarely comment But this subject I can relate to My 17 yr old son is a Type 1 Diabetic Because of the HUGE cost of his insulin we are on State Insurance When he turn 18 I fear for him the cost of his Novalog and his Lantus per month can be more then 1200 00 a month out of pocket and that scare the hell out of me
Zain Zinedine	Trump 2020
vastowen456	coma or death because these may become permanent are you saying death ISNT permanent
cheery oats	I can t believe you re not taking about what the Trump administration is trying to do to trans people This is major and the government is trying to wipe u out of history we need help and we need people to talk about it
David Card	This is an empty move that wont actually do anything about price Its just a PR move that look good at first glance and most people wont pay attention after the fact to see if it did anything or not
Riryoku	Why people are freaking out about my association with BetterHelp and how I continue to milk money from the depressed I think this is a fitting title for your next video phillyboy
Kaitie Kawaii Grundner	I wa under the impression they didn t list price because they vary due to insurance or lack there of I understand their fear here because even if there wa a disclaimer like this cost is minus any assistance your insurance might provide seeing a largr number undoubtedly will dissuade people from even asking about it
Wesley Pierre Jr	I love this extra video Keep em coming

Ciorram1	lmao 01 07 Coma or death a these may become permanent
Jess	Already loving the morning video I ve got a few concern with this topic of the video 1 I m worried that if when drug company ARE forced to advertise the cost of their drug on TV commercial wont they try to minimize the actual cost a much a they can Similar to how the soda industry minimizes the amount of sugar per serving by suggesting that the serving size is 2 per bottle or hiding the sugar with other additive 2 Since alternative drug dont advertise on TV why do we let the name brand have commercial And even if we DO continue to let them advertise on TV and the price is listed on tv why shouldnt it be required on the website Websites tend to offer more information than a TV spot anyway 3 Drug company are manipulative little shit I m not sure that if any of this is indeed implemented if there will be any change whatsoever People are STILL going to have to shell out hundred of thousand of dollar to pay for the life saving drug that they NEED That s why the drug industry have gotten away with this shit for so long after all You cant put a price on your life
Omari_X 65	This is actually a hard topic because I see point on both side I do think the website idea is actually a more balanced solution Maybe they should make THAT the requirement since it currently just a voluntary proposal
Melanie Anne	Phil said television ad specifically several time and at one point even said the new rule wouldn t apply to the Internet Streaming service even those own by medium giant like CBS are by definition not television So in essence this rule is a day late and a dollar short In 5 to 10 year the majority of the population in the u s won t be watching television on the TV they will be watching it over the Internet which mean you will not have to comply to the new rule So sure they ll put up a fuss but not for long because any smart add exact is going to know that it s not really going to apply to them for very long
Clay More	Two word opioid crisis How much do they make
Bwaas	Wait is he a racist jerk or a good president Tell me how to think
sergeantassassin3	1 Good on the Trump Administration for this one This is coming from someone who hate Trump a a person so you know it s genuine Pharmaceutical regulation in the country is lax a a whole and need stricter control 2 Taking it one step further there should be a maximum price cap put in place regarding drug that have life saving property and or are required for certain people to live properly Charging hundred of dollar for a single dose of certain medication that prevent people from outright dying is completely predatory and should be unlawful regardless of your view on free market capitalism There are just some thing you DON T DO and making it cost hundred of dollar for an epipen for example should be criminal
SnorlaxRae	I think this could be good Shaming into compliance won t work but competition absolutely will If we can get that going we ll see some pretty effective result I can only hope that health insurance is allowed to compete across state line to begin lowering price We saw this when car insurance wa opened up and now we have some very low price
S. C.	So even when Trump doe an amazing move for the population Phil remains biased Mate I think you ve been consulting with those qualified therapist from Better Help for way too long and it might be actually making you mental instead of more stable
Stephen Tarver	Did one of those ad say that death wa a side effect And that it may be permanent
Meghan McDonnell	I don t care about the ad a much a letting the gov nogotiate price That is what is going to drive down price and we ve needed it for a long time
Dawn	I think transparent drug price would be a good thing It ’ s crazy to me when I go to the doctor if I ask for the price of anything the Drs nurse etc give me the deer in headlight look Like they ’ re shocked that a patient would consider the price before agreeing to certain scan test vaccine medicine and so on I even asked for the cost of a routine check up and they couldn ’ t give me a straight answer It ’ s ridiculous But to the point about prescription perhaps Drs could give u better medical advice if they knew how much their recommended treatment would cost their patient Maybe they ’ d offer holistic approach to actually cure underlying issue rather than prescribing pill that ’ ll cost an arm and a leg per month indefinitely to bandage symptom
Howlkipsure	So remember when we shamed the epipen people for boosting their price to like 300 they are still charging that much shaming doesnt work All this will do is the same thing car price do not give an accurate representation of what the drug cost due to factor that influence the price and because of this drug company could just put any ol price on the ad and say ya this is the cost pre adjustment This wont really do much
original Elkid	Philip please do a report on this please
Humanoid25	That moment when the Trump administration want to make everyone but themselves transparent and accountable for their action
wlaba272	I wouldn t lower the price of my drug I d make them even higher and advertise them a prestige product It s pure marketing
Something Fishie	Since one of the biggest problem with the health care industry a a whole is that nobody really know what their health care cost I am a huge fan of this drive to make consumer more aware of drug price Now let s do procedure and operation and treatment We know right up front what plastic surgery or lasik eye surgery cost so how about we do that for everything This is a good start
Seth Rosson	This really just seems like a good thing to me IF anything it doesn t go far enough Those commercial are emotionally manipulative and should probably not be allowed at all But hey it s at least a step forward I m personally more interested in the more competition bit because more competition is good for everyone except those without competitor Lower price and better product Competition is what drive innovation and progress Now I don t know how the government would go about achieving more competition without simply stifling large company but if it can be done it would be great for everyone
Sean Toney	Death may become permanent
Adam Wood	Love it
bobby288	This will do absolutely nothing to drug price

Rump Buffalo	So basically Trump is expanding Obamacare ACA
Hayley Tvede	I wa a little concerned when I saw the title and thought it would be bad news but I wa happy to be wrong I think more transparency is needed regarding the cost of medication However I do think any good doctor is aware of the cost of a particular drug for the most part and will bring that up in conversation Another good resource for discussion regarding medication cost and insurance is your pharmacist They are more aware of the latest release and alternative that could be used They also have an idea of what certain insurance will and will not cover because they have to process insurance with the medication so much
M. de k.	Lol you have prescription drug a ad That is ridiculous
Kelly Kernaghan	Ha your country suck
Andrew Spence	I will say I am shocked this administration is doing anything about drug pricing however this seems largely symbolic to me Republicans are getting killed on healthcare right now and this seems like a bandaid midterm solution with no real impact The drug industry make a god awful amount of money and anything that might influence them to lower price is great This just seems like a baby step into what could be done
Stashdragon	Even a broken clock is right twice a day
warwerewolf777	I m shocked the orange idiot is doing something decent for people I wonder what the catch is
FrizzBear	Let s be completely clear People already don t purchase life saving necessary drug they need because of the cost Listing the cost of the drug in the commercial is not going to change that Us not knowing at the time doesn t change the fact that we just don t have money We either wont see a doctor about it or won t pick up the drug at the pharmacy once we hear the cost
Terry Dolphin	Never thought I would say this thanks trump lol Such a pro consumer move Smart going into the mid term
Ratchat2000 Rocket League Content	I hate the current healthcare system Legitimately feel like educated professional we re supposed are selling u snake oil That being sad I m not an Antivacer and if something s wrong I d go to the doctor but I wouldn t agree to take anything they suggest without research especially not painkiller or anti depression anxiety Meds
Fernando Herrera	I love it when you Phil me in in the morning Daddy
Hector Quintero	The Pharmaceutical industry along with education are Americas two biggest issue Im with trump and what he doing on this one
Vokoder	I think in addition to this pharmacy should be required to print how much your insurance company is paying on your recipient There have been a few time where I wa under the impression my insurance wa covering a huge proportion of my prescription and wa shocked to find out it wa on 10 15 A more informed consumer is always a better thing

Bubba Falcon	Laughed so hard on the coma or death a these may become permanent part of the commercial
Dakota Moore	For every Adderol there s about 20 different generic brand that cost le than 10 of the name brand pill That s the issue for me My insurance cover it but my parent My parent can t afford their various old people pill because of the absurd price They need to advertise a generic drug along side their namebrand one because there s rarely much of a difference

Gabriela Ramírez Zanon Ghovatto	this is the dumbest thing ever at the internet age people are more than capable of researching price and adjusting the best possible medication to their budget we dont need the government to act like an overprotective annoying mother a if we are a bunch of dumbass
quincy briley	I think this is literally the first thing the trump administration ha done that I approve of
Night Star	I have a few point 1 why is it against free speech to require drug company to at least put text on the screen stating their price but fine to talk about how you should talk to your doctor if you die There is very little difference in my opinion I don t know what the reaction wa to that law but I bet it wa similar to this 2 I think that drug company should be allowed to advertise their product but they shouldn t bombard u with them a if they are promoting lobster fest Like tone it down to at least one every hour maybe 3 this won t solve much Maybe one company is going to lower their price so it sound good but for the most part they re just going to bitch about free speech then just have the price in the background a x before Insurance As another commentor said this is barely a bandaid This is covering the wound with a teeshirt and hoping nobody notice
Just trying to understand	I don t think it will have any affect on drug price Most drug are not advertised on TV What is stopping them from lowering the price of drug that are advertised and raise the price of other drug that are not advertised
Kat Jenkins	I m a New Zealander and I find it bizarre we have law to allow pharmaceutical ad because we don t really have many I ve watched TV in America and the difference between whatever regulation we have and that of the US is very different on TV screen It s nowhere near a much and the content is often almost an infomercial That said we have socialised healthcare and we can access most thing for 5 prescription a it s subsidised So all over it really feel like America is alone in the style and volume of these ad New Zealand might allow them but it is not an apple to apple comparison

Tanner B. Seymour	Ok first off I didn ’ t vote for Trump or Hillary but I ’ m glad Trump won I mean business is flourishing my work ha doubled staff in my department due to some tax break growth and I ’ m seeing so much more freedom from my generation when it come to choice and economic growth I won ’ t say I ’ m a big fan of Trump conduct but I ’ m grateful his administration is directly giving more freedom and benefit to the middle and even lower class This is one of the greatest and safest time to be alive I ’ m just grateful for it and hopefully we can stop with the violence and riot and political bloodshed and people return to being grateful that this nation is improving tremendously God Bless America and her people no matter what side you ’ re on this sound like a win
Susan Stone	Abilify the medicine for when your other medicine aren t working is 4 000 a month if you don t have insurance If we display price in ad either consumer reconciles with the idea of buying pill Oh maybe it s not a problem that can be fixed with medicine one step closer to understanding that mental illness is only caused by living in an environment that can not provide you with your basic need which is one step closer to understanding that we live in a country that thrives off of creating environment that will not provide basic need and then selling them a shoddy excuse of an answer a very expensive drug God fucking forbid we understand our potential a individual But a long a there s a way to make money off of u instead the consumer will get a more affordable price for these glorified bandaids and we re gon na act like this is a good thing when we start seeing thing change Which will look like more access to pill which will ultimately lead to more unhappy people investing in a flimsy answer for their trouble Which a a reminder this lead to more already impoverished people buying pill that promise happiness and relief but have a huge risk of killing you or causing serious harm Even something a simple a changing your pill routine can cause Antipsychotic drug induced dysphoria like Chester Bennignton or even myself which lead Chester to kill himself and which led me to my suicide attempt Plenty of people walk away from a failed regimen with tardive dyskinesia a condition where you can t control your facial movement anymore which can ultimately cause more shame embarrassment and depressive behavior than you had before you tried to fix it with a pill There are so many potential risk with these pill that you just have to stop and think Is it worth it The answer is NO Ask yourself why you think you need the pill The answer is your need are not being met in your current environment Which will cause symptom that doctor will claim is something wrong with your body your brain Don t let a salesman with a stethoscope fool you Anyone can shop for doctor nowadays and get several different diagnosis until they find the one that suit them ultimately letting a label define them This frustrates me to no end My parent shopped around for a doctor starting at age 6 I ve been diagnosed with everything from Bipolar to Borderline Personality Disorder to Mood Disorder not specified to ODD ADD Vitamin Deficiency PTSD each doctor saying the doctor before them wa wrong and that they have it right When parent are looking for an answer to why their kid is so fucked up they re never going to place blame onto themselves Especially if the child doesn t disclose any sexual abuse going on So I got pill after pill diagnosis after diagnosis 10 day hospitalization with every missed dose or regimen change These pill and my belief in them took 12 year of my life Needless to say I don t take them anymore I still have bad day yeah I still become depressed and feel extremely deeply I can be moody and downright intolerable to many people but I wouldn t have it any other way I m not living for them I m living for me I just can t wait till the day where selling pill to child isn t normal I can t wait until that 70 of Americans realize that they don t need pill Take your power back
Herbert De Leon	wow what do you know the trump administration is actually doing something productive and actually doing his job to protect american from corporate greed i didn t think id see the day of his doing something actually good
Charles Klempner	It is exactly what Trump supporter expected Trump ran on this and like all of his promise he is moving toward that Capitalism and democracy work but not if the official on both side are paid off Trump is the first real president in my Lifetime Obama should hand with the rest of the FBI and Hillary Soy boy and Manwoman should die off in the future a they do not reproduce anyways
JC Fennec	Coma or death a these may become permanent meaning there s a chance I could arise from death Like a a vampire Fuck yeah I want vampire power I could fight crime with that shit Seriously if I wa given any sort of mystical power I would become a real life superhero That shit would be lit
Julian Ka	So would this potentially impact epi pen a well and their ridiculous price tag
Damian Spence	A wild idea Why don t you just take what the doctor prescribes
ErebosGR	1 07 coma or death a these may become permanent lmao
Ethan Russell	Don t like advertising because of the high price Lower the price or a competitor to your company will find a way to make and sell the drug cheaper welcome to capitalism baby
Cybernetik Soul	I don t know how to feel about this On one hand people can get the medication they need On the other hand would that mean the would be an increase in prescription given out Im not saying all are like this but it would be foolish to not address the fact that some who write prescription are a little too happy to do so I wa a home care provider and eventually I had to help a client get a better doctor because of this issue My client is doing ton better now despite being afflicted with a so far incurable disease I m a little torn Cautiously optimistic As far a pharma retort of price confusion there a simple answer to that Tell people what the price is if you dont have insurance
Justin Scheepers	1 08 Warning Death may be permanent

dabruiser79	i love two video day
Dante	A good thing From these guy What sorcery is this
The Milhouse Experience	Ordinary footage of a bear by adult swim
Mellow Dee	I think it ’ s more important to make doctor disclose if they are being paid by pharmaceutical company to push certain drug on their patient one can simply call their pharmacy to ask how much a certain drug cost Putting it in ad is pointless
kami243n	Law to keep any and all drug company and pharmacy from raising any drug more than a 100 increase will do much more No company need more than double a cost of anything Some of these drug are more then 6000 marked up to keep the poor from having them And to make them richer Personally that should be considered treason to hold someone life ransom for money That prof lack of basic humanity Doctors are guilty of this in this age too NO self respecting doctor 100 year ago would let anyone go untreated money or no money doctor of today are shameful shill who need to wear jacket that look like race car so we can see their sponsor
Divine Silence	I like it Also I think the government should get into making genaric version of medacins so there can be a lower cost version and if some one want to buy a name brand they can but atleast there is an alternative
Lexi Hall	Personally I think this is a smart move in the right direction american drug price and pharma industry are well known to be higher than average listing price and helping to drive competition are GOOD thing and I would love to see where this go in the future
Wednesday Antilles	You should do an interview with Dr Zubin Damania aka ZDoggMD He ’ s an emergency care physician who ha spent most of his career advocating for change from the ground up in the healthcare industry He ’ s done a couple of TedMed talk on the subject and ha a YouTube channel where he talk about stuff like this in detail He ’ s pretty fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable
Feyangel23	I have to say I m not a pro Trump person but this move by him to change the drug industry is a positive change for Americans Honestly extremely astonished that he d do something like this a with what he s said and done in the past you wouldn t expect a move like this to come from him 2018 still seems like a bizarre year so far
Dre B	Guess what else happened in the 80 The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 where vaccine manufacturer were given complete legal immunity so when your child are harmed by vaccine you can ’ t sue Then they ramped up the schedule Now we are seeing skyrocketing number in child of autoimmune disease neurological delay seizure disorder and the unhealthiest generation in decade
Frankie West	Love these video keep it up
Joshua C	This is probably the only thing the Trump administration ha planned to do that I support with no reservation This can only be a good thing for the average person
David Fitzsimmons	I laugh at them trying to claim the pricing is too complicated to be advertised Sorry but a this video pointed out the government requires pricing listed on car advertisement and those also are pretty complicated in term of what you may end up actually paying And the cry of breaking the first ammendment Sorry but that same argument could be applied to the side affect you are required to state in the advertisement so they already have a precedent in being allowed to enforce what pharmaceutical are required to state in their advertisement
raynebc	Drug company and health provider should be shamed by being forced to display their real pre insurance price
TheDiMono	Coma or death a these may become permanent YA DON T SAY
William A	So they have to say how much their drug cost okay thats cool but how about helping to bring down their cost
NukaColaQT	This is absolutely worthless They re just doing this so they can say they re hard on big pharma like Trump said he would when campaigning This doe absolutely nothing If a doctor prescribes a drug it doesn t matter if the commercial for it ha a price you still have to take it The people of this country have been shaming big pharma for year but that doesn t stop them from increasing price Why would they feel shame when staring at their huge mansion nice car and bank account getting bigger This move doesn t actually help anyone in any meaningful way
Michelle D	Wait what Coma or Death a these may become permanent How is death not permanent
Cupcake Jake	While I do think this is actually pretty great my problem is that they are only required to list the price in TV ad I don t know a single person that watch TV anymore so this really doesn t change much They should make them list the price everywhere especially for their social medium ad
Someone Special	Pharmacy company we don t want to slap a solid price on our product because then we can t over charge people
Valquereon	I honestly don t know how this will help when most pharmacy will dispense generic unless specifically told not to or one is not yet on the market Where I hope this would make the most impact if it did convince drug company to lower their price would be on thing like Insulin Even with discount card like Goodrx you can find on the Internet I have still had patient unable to afford their insulin and pas on it
My Planet PlayStation	Very much in favor of these extra video Also very glad to see Trump carrying through on his promise with Big Pharma
Camden Pyne	How about instead we have socialized healthcare like basically the entire developed world
Durango Kid NR	I sure hope drug company lower their price I had to take some antibiotic for a week for a respiratory infection and it cost me 300 I cant afford that shit It probably cost the company like 5 to make all that shit and then now that Im sick and have no other option they get to charge me so much I might not be able to pay rent The fuck is that bullshit
Ken Dac	TV ad is just a small percentage of total advertising
After9Design	I wa prescribed a hormone cream recently and surprised that it wa 90 even with my Medicare co pay I asked if it wa a mistake and the pharmacist said that without insurance it wa 900 What wa in it Goldust Dragon gonad It s hormone cream not some life saving cancer drug Yes go after these viper
strung out on nostalgia	Like I said before the Trump base hate corporatism I may not like their social politics and think their mentally retarded when it come to the economy but I think we can reach across the aisle on this issue While I believe it should be more severe than just forcing them to show the price I ll wait until I see some data if it actually shame them into lowering it price
Dudeonwheels	The Trump administration doing something to help consumer rather than big corporation I don t buy it Something seems off What s the catch
Audra Blankenship	How about having the drug company disclose the percentage of the cost of the drug a well That could actually affect their bottom dollar If they showed how much went into advertising v research development production cost and then of course pocket lining consumer might actually become educated on cost
Zannmaster	Anything that take big pharma down a peg is good in my book
FunkyBarron	Death can become permanent My god how can we sell these
jblue1622	Has anyone ever actually gone to their doctor and requested a drug they saw in an ad and benefited
Apollo Fell	You know what would REALLY help the American people Universal healthcare and no prescription drug ad at all
Bob Dillion	Wonder why Obama didn ’ t do this ow ye because he wa getting million in back handers from big pharm but he wa all for the people
Klick Witch	I do think being open with price will cause drug company to lower price to something more reasonable Particularly if this is just a drug for something not urgently needed like restless leg syndrome In regard to the argument about the price can change based on drug plan include that info in the commercial check with your doctor if this drug is right for you and don t forget this drug is covered under many health plan
Cody Player - Ashkii	Nice one Trump Very cool
Adam Quintana	I am very surprised I didn t think the Trump administration would do anything goo But still I am very uncertain
Richard Aldrich	‘ or death a these may become permanent ’ lmao
wiet111	It s kind of a step in the good direction but they should just van direct to consumer advertisement We train doctor to be expert Just listen to your doctor I come from the Netherlands where doctor are really strict You can t get medicine much stronger than ibuprofen without a doctor s recipe and apothecary try to give generic medicine when available Its not perfect but certainly better than this
David Moss	Please let your doctor know if you experience death I ll keep that in mind
Na Cl	Welp a part of the 30 percent who dont need any prescription drug least not yet in their life this really doesn t affect simply peek my interest of how this will unfold
Donovan Buck	I don t like trup but I can admit when the guy doe something right good on him
HappyFluegel	actually a little suprissed a small step but a steo nontheless
Foggy Studios	When the commercial were going all I could think of wa Unedited Footage of a Bear
Steven	If people know the price and if US medical patent law change for the favor for smaller drug company this can have a huge upset and might dramatically drop medical price
Dustballguy	I m glad these morning video are back
Cat Crupi	I wish drug such a insulin and all other prescription that people have to take to live had their price regulated by the govt
Mojo Woelflein	First off love the boost of graphic and editing quality Looks very smooth My opinion I think what the Trump administration is doing is good Drug company are mostly in what they do for money Showing what a certain drug will cost is a way so consumer especially the elderly know what they would be paying for their drug they need I think this is a good move on their part
Scott Armiger	Hello hello welcome to the morning show We re doing rhyme now Phil This is what it come to
Riley Parnwell	Uh oh New Zealand ha something in common with the U S I feel faint
that guy down the street	I knew atleast one thing good would come out of the trump administration This is it
Becca Mack	Loving this extra video
Matizicov	Good first step but fine them for every month of non compliance We all know company s don t budge on just being insulted they have to lose money to really give a damn Or at least to do something to lose le money
Audra Verela	Okay Medication is a huge subject to confront Let me know if any of this ha changed especially since when I went to school First this doesn t take into account that insurance company whenever there is a choice will always go for the le expensive medication i e the generic brand Why Because the medication is the same That way they get to pay le and in return so do you Second doctor these day are being taught to unless it is a condition that is already well underway go for the non medication route People are not taking care of themselves If in roughly 6 week nothing change despite active participation on the patient s part then medication is prescribed Sometimes le time sometimes more Third doctor can and will change medication to suit the individual Fourth honestly it s talked about how such advertisement for medication are the bane of a doctor s existence People see these ad and wonder if they need these medication but it s up to the doctor and the insurance company to dole them out or not By this time these medication are known by these doctor Some patient will go around to doctor until they get the medication they want Fifth there are incentive for doctor to prescribe medication by the drug manufacturer That need to fucking change It s not so blatant a all that since that s actually illegal but it s been known to happen That need to change Sixth brand name medication are already fucking protected under federal law that no generic brand will make the same drug for year so the brand name is exclusive It s a double edged sword in a way though one side may be more sharp than the other It give the drug more time out in the world with a larger testing group even though they are rigorously tested beforehand to see what could happen on a much larger scale It also may prevent people who do need the medication but can not afford it from getting the help they need since generic drug must also prove that they are the same on every level to their brand counterpart
Josefin S	As a physician working in a country with universal healthcare and high cost protection I obviously think this is better than nothing However in the long run I think the best way to protect patient from high price would be a high cost protection for prescription drug I e Patients only pay full price for their drug until a certain threshold After that they pay a progressively cheaper price until they ve reached the maximum spending threshold the maximum amount you have to spend on drug in a year after which they get their drug for free until a year ha passed since the first purchase Then the cycle start again The system is of course financed through tax It is quite good for keeping the price down aswell because if I prescribe a brand name drug to a patient the pharmacy will switch it to the cheapest non brand eqivalent This obviously motivates the company to keep their price down If I for some reason don t want the drug switched I can note that on the prescription and the patient will get the more expensive one still within high cost protection If my medical opinion is that it doesn t matter whether the drug is switched or not but the patient want the brand name drug anyway they can get that one but they have to pay for the price difference themselves As for drug ad I think it is weird to advertise for prescription drug It is not like any other consumer product that you go shopping for at leisure I am all for transparency but I don t think that ad are the best provider of that Obviously I would personally never withhold vital information from my patient or purposefully decieve them in any way and of course I think they should be able to do their own research Here we have a sort of national registry of all drug on the market It is available online for free and there is information written in leymans term a well a in med speech I feel like site like that are better for transparency than an ad from a pharmaceutical company
Lee Rogers	Moved for the confusion
Hunter Crumpley	I am in no way a supporter of the Trump administration but I do have to admit that I like this proposal I am a college student taking 150 worth of prescription drug per month and I do think this proposal could lower the price of prescription I do not understand how anyone could think this is a violation of the first amendment We should have a right to this information
D. W.	call your doctor if you experience a COMA OR DEATH AS THESE MAY BE PERMANENT hahahahahaha Jesus Christ
ᙅYᙖᙓᖇ ᗪOᙅ™	Another reason to say FUCK legalization for marijuana Decriminalize it instead Stop giving these corporation and government agency all of your hard earned money Just grow your own and don t tell anyone Live your life Peace
Kevbro9	Sounds great really surprised to see this from Trump however if the only enforcement action against non complying company is placement on a naughty list then it wont do anything The law will pas company will change nothing all of them get placed on a list If go even deeper into my skepticism I d even say that this is a move that s meant to look really good while ultimately changing nothing Though that might be going off the deep end and at the very least this will get a foot in the door and will allow for enforcement action to be included at a later date
KuronoXD	I always love the defense from big company of We should not do this because it will confuse their weak little mind so we are withholding that information for THEIR benefit not ours
Dustin Cook	awesome video
littleferrhis	I never understood why drug have advertisement I ’ m going to get whatever drug my doctor tell me to get I trust him her over the TV
Sarah M.	I think this is a good move but I think it s smoke and mirror
jason haliski	The U S price are higher because in some poorer country get charged way le They can take a loss in these country in order to supply poorer country with life saving drug that we take for granted So our country ha to pay more so the drug company can make a profit This enables them to do research on future life saving drug
Murican Stek	So I m definitely left of center and I m not a trump fan but i can 100 support any attempt to lower drug price because it crazy right now I started taking Adderall for ADHD at age 6 and I m 19 now and the price are insane and it s same thing for my friend who take insulin for diabetes something need to be done
Matthew Greenfield	The U S A s drug company charge citizen of the U S A higher price just because they can You can get the same medication same brand manufacturer et cetera for a far lesser price in almost every other country in the world Not to mention it is also the U S A s biggest business so they of course will be fighting tooth and nail to not have the price shown for they don t need to be that high
SandDeath24	I m tired of every group yelling first ammendant right everytime they dont want to comply with something It s become meaningless now
jBear	Wow I m impressed by this move and I think it will help though not a much a single payer and Bernie s proposed legislation The thing is this go beyond shaming the company It is informing consumer and promoting competition That will be a force pushing price lower However this doe fall apart when there are oligopoly involved who can set agreed upon price which will almost certainly happen yes it s illegal no I don t think that will stop pharma company
Sophia Neilsson	As a New Zealander I feel compelled to ad that our advertising of medicine is NOTHING like America I wa blown away when I visited at the saturation and variety of pharmaceutical advertising We have the odd one for hayfever medicine or viagra but that s about it The two aren t even on the same stage tbh We also have public healthcare most medicine is 5 unless unsubsidized and free after your 20th prescription in the family for the year so it s a completely different beast
Talha Mukhtar	Rather than lower price per se this might instead cause company to lower LISTED price and renegotiate with insurance company to decrease insurance discount and standardize cost so that actual cost becomes closer to a lower listed price This will increase transparency immensely It will also be extremely helpful to those without insurance who have to pay listed price for prescription medication
zebra turkeyfish	this is a good move
Ricky Roro	Loved the morning episode loved the new format I do not support this move because I do not see how this will get american off drug
V Britt	Don t comment much but love the AM Show
Tristyn Bunney	More Philip Defranco the better Bring on the morning video

Notso Bright	Yes it s hard to deny your drug is artificially expensive when u have to say your price aloud

Kaitlin Geddis	Not going to lie given this administration I wa sure this wa going to be about how they were going to make drug cost more because let s be real here this administration ha made life harder for people
Ben Dawson	I m definitely surprised by the Trump administration trying to lower drug price but I see this a not being the most efficient route to achieve that goal Putting cap on percentage increase in price from production value is the most efficient way to protect consumer something like a 300 increase from production value including research creation and shipping cost is enough for a company to grow and continue to produce new drug A more specific number could be calculated by using cost report from the pharmaceutical company Government need to have a heavier presence in pharmaceutical some level of profit is necessary for growth but earning money off of life saving medication is not helping anyone
Kelsey Keller	Are we talking USA or North America here Here in Canada we have drug commercial too would price listing become a standard here too
Untitled	seriously america just quit your drug advert speak to your doctor if you have a problem
TulyMoody	Sounds like a good step but I think it would be ineffective
drigerbladejr	just a thought i see this situation turning out similar to that of video game if not careful publisher agree to a single price of a game or product and that becomes the normal price for any new big hit game to hit the market if the publisher dont agree to that pricing yeah that game wont make it i could definitely see company agreeing to over charge for let say acetomaphin product ex to make up the ‘ loss ” of other product to make it a more presentable or reasonable rate to lure in consumer while gouging others Hospitals for year have over charged for late night visit to the emergency room because it dark out over bright or perhaps they have to pay for that new mri machine definitely that one It is scarey knowing how much they manipulate financially a it is

0xygenIsOverRated	Orange man bad
B Blackwell	It s like doing something you know won t work just so you can say you did something
Sol Oshyn	I think this is great because it force these company to be more transparent with their consumer The money for prescription is absolutely ridiculous especially with all the side effect that come along that can be potentially permanent I say fuck em and it the least they can do for taking advantage of sick people
ShadowKnight	drug company have had an effective monopoly in the US for a long time raising price ha been a thing for a while once they found out i am more surprised the government is only doing something now i am happy it is happening but this is something that should have happened a while ago
PattiL007	Yes surprised but they said raising price of cigs would have no effect big business switching argument now 😳😀
Susan Rowe	Let s talk about better help
BeckiWitte	Since when doe truth in advertising need any beneficiary other than the truth Regardless of the effect on price Other kind of company aren t required to list their price to keep cost low no it is because the consumer ha a right to know the cost
Zyon Chaos	Consult your doctor if you suffer from any of these side effect coma or death a these may become permanent WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK Who would ve thought death could be permanent unless you are a comic book character seriously I thought the prescription service in the UK wa messed up but suddenly paying £8 80 per item isn t that bad and if you have a lot of medication you can pay £10 per month for a prescription prepayment card which mean my wife doesn t have to pay £88 00 every 4 week for her med Why the fuck do Americans put up with the health insurance lottery that you do Why don t you lobby for congress to do something about it Get rid of your politician one by one until you have one that will do it

Mark Heath	Show the price I really like this idea It may not guarantee lower price but the drug company have been gouging the public for year We dont need to make it easier for them
StuckOnMyOwnPlanet	I mean ok yes older generation watch TV and see commercial but not having this impact internet website or social medium advertisement make me feel iffy How is YouTube classified on this list How about Hulu More and more people stream their daily entertainment intake My parent who will both be retired by next year do not watch television anymore This feel like a short sighted look we did what we said that won t really be of any influence in the coming year Unless this is like a foot in the door kind of situation which sure guess we can wait and see on that Honestly though if they want to make an impact make the company showcase the price of the drug up front on their website Or have an easy to use calculator built in so individual can calculate how much it s going to cost them based on what type of coverage they have Some of those website are incredibly confusing when it come to price That would be a helpful change More and more people research using the internet we should focus on that a well a tv commercial

Stephen Mihlan	I really think even harsher measure need to be taken against pharmaceutical company but this is a step in the right direction
Marnise Nicole Fine Art	Love the morning show
Justice C	Wait that last point seems logically fallacious Shaming company won t get them to lower their price No but making the price of the pill show up on the ad will keep patient from using drug that literally cost the same a a car Also the price should be listed I m on board with this Also I suggest you go watch Unedited footage of a bear put out by adult swim The point made by the horror skit is very much relevant to this There s a good Night Mind episode explaining it too
xJadeWolfxx	While I want to give Trump credit for trying something with the drug company and healthcare in general this is treating the symptom not the disease The problem is life saving drug shouldn t be so prohibitive in the first place Healthcare the right to be fucking healthy should be an inalienable right and the fact that the United States is so behind the rest of the modern world in this practice is shameful We need single payer healthcare so people stop having to go on disability to fund their life saving treatment so we can stop crowdfunding care through thing like GoFundMe and focus on getting our people healthy so they can be productive citizen It s really hard to hold down a job when you are practically dying from a treatable illness
OneWeekRainisu	I think this is a great move for Trump I and think I can tell you what will happen Drug company will start to pull ad I think that is the most logical thing they would do They don ’ t want to have the same pricing a generic brand med This will cause them to want to show the middle finger to Trump and pull TV ad Which is probably what they were going for lol hope to see le tv med ad Get rid of the webmd hysteria
TemeryN	wow Phil this is a tough one on 1 hand I don t think prescription drug should be advertised at all but on the other hand the ad do raise awareness and could lead to some seeking help How about instead of telling u how much they cost to buy why not tell u how much they cost to produce including testing passing FDA standard etc the total cost and we ll pay a small percent above that like 5 for profit think about it should our health be made into an industry something to buy sell I don t think it should ever have been When it come to our health we should pay what it cost to produce health not retail We also need to change the education process and cost so that our medical staff are not burdened with high debt at graduation then they could make le in salary and thing could be more affordable that way too So many side to this issue
Shaggy72	Well in 2013 I had prescription drug to help me on bad day when my inoperable back condition wa too much to handle But then Trump decided that evil evil Obama wa pure evil so he got rid of Obamacare even though Obamacare wa based on the system from Mitt Romney a republican So I just live with the pain daily all the time now I ve forgotten how it feel to have a good night sleep where a bolt of pain doesnt awaken you if you turn the wrong way But y know i m poor Poor people can t pay for healthcare or lawyer
Jonathon Roth	Tell your doctor if you experience death 🤣🤦‍♂️
wesley mulligan	I m confused on how it would infringe on our first amendment Can someone explain what the argument is there I m so confused with that
JoeDaBro	MAGA
Dillon_Thunder	Hello hello Uhhhhhhh I don t think so
Katy Didn't	In the end nothing will really change price These company know that we need to take these medication to either stay alive or to have a bearable quality of life They have u cornered and many of u are too exhausted from our poor health to fight about it
Mkx56	I don ’ t think that showing the price will lower the price of the drug initially But it will make a more well informed consumer If there is an alternative to said drug and cheaper it will effectively lower the price Simple economics
Emily A	As a worker in the health care field I think this would be an interesting change and a change I would most likely welcome One of the biggest challenge is dealing with patient insurance company to approve coverage for a medication they need or getting a medication they ve taken for several year re approved because they changed what wa covered from a month ago due to an alternative being cheaper to manufacture I ve seen patient not being able to afford insulin because their insurance wouldn t cover the insulin that work best with their body Do I think this change to ad will completely fix the current pharmaceutical inflation issue not even close But I hope that it will put pressure on them to make their medication more cost effective if paid out of pocket
upfrontchart 66	I think that it would be good but a you said the price can change depending on what type of insurance you have so I think that they should make free healthcare so that it would work a lot easier
Terminal Insanity	im all for high priced drug for optional thing advertised on TV They should increase price for people who request thing to discourage use and help lower the cost of prescribed drug that people actually need without a tv offer
CoAndCoLaptopAccount	This is good
Bews	Thanks Trump very cool
Rona1776	I personally approve of putting the price of the drug on ad It let you get all the information you need and no it will not make people miss out on a drug they need That s a dumb argument Just say you want our money and go
Ron Consumer	Big Pharma what a joke this is one way to manage your issue never intending to cure you Why would they want to cure you when they rake in billion to keep you sick and just manage your illness Glad I found a doctor to give me medical marijuana when the medical doctor in so many word to just go home and die There s nothing else we can do for you You know the scenario for those who ever suffered from cancer Just think thanks to one plant turned me into a survivor rather than a statistic
SwordBreaker925	I ve never really bought into the idea of drug company purposely not curing disease in order to make a profit but after seeing just how much they pharmaceutical industry make per year it s kinda hard to deny anymore
human713	Seems like a step in the right direction but the fact that there s still a good chance that insurance company will take pharma side here make me think the better move is paying tax for true coverage healthcare
Alit Memeti	Good job Trump
kdtfiles1	I got the shock of a lifetime twice when it come to perception price first time I went to pick up my Humira prescription wa told it would be 2000 out of pocket had to wait a couple week before insurance and the drug company ’ s “ saving card ” got sorted out ended up only costing 5 with the card I ’ d like to know why if they can drop the price if you get their FREE card why don ’ t they just offer the drug cheaper Second time wa after I lost my insurance I went for my 3rd Inflexamab infusion after stopping Humira Was floored when they said 5200 out of pocket FOR ONE INFUSION Needless to say I didn ’ t get it Had to wait nearly 3 month trying to get new insurance with a preexsisting condition before I could get back on it
Felix Rolf	Being Europa based it awesome to hear you during the noon hour
TheonEvilbuho	Make the morning show a permanent thing I love it Only thing missing is Phil drinking coffee
RAIN MAYHEM	I feel like we are missing something because the government ha always catered to big pharma and other massive corporation so why would they now start to fuck them over
Annie Bananie	I despise trump with every fiber of my being but this is actually headed in the right direction We need more transparency with prescription drug especially when they ’ re so often abused and consumer are ripped off
Cameron Fischer	Coma or death a these may become permanent
Joel DELETED	I like the idea of bringing down price and transparency As a recently recovered chronically ill patient the amount of money spent to get my condition stable and tolerable wa about 30 000 dollar May not seem like a huge amount but this is after most of it wa payed by insurance company If I weren t lucky enough to have non medicaid insurance I would have had a very hard time getting through the situation where I wa unable to work in any way for the 4 year I wa sick However the defense of making it difficult to accurately price the medication in the ad due to varying insurance coverage is a solid point
Hershi Schur	Idk cheaper drug seems pretty racist
captaincomfycactus	New editing
Spookis Ghostly	Maybe Trump is finally doing something good again
wastingsanity	There is another reason this should actually be a thing let s say a person decides that they may want to take a certain drug They go to their doctor and find out that it is a little over priced so they decide not to Now they go out and make a copay for the doctor s visit Had they have known prior odds are they wouldn t have had that extra bill Also Phil leave the morning show in Either that or just pre cover extra content and the Philly D show become 7 day a week Just schedule it for release that way no one need to be in the office or click the public button on the weekend
enderpony80	Go trump
Alexander Bahn	I feel like I woke up in an alternate dimension where the Trump administration is actually considering doing something that might benefit consumer for once that or big Pharma didn t grease his palm when they had the chance
Ratz Buddie	There ha been a dramatic rise since the 80 Probably not surprising to anybody that s heard of the US Why do the change only apply to TV ad That s not the only medium outlet and it s faaar from being the giant it used to be This is a potential step in what could be considered the right direction but we ll see
tobi totashi	Honestly I m surprised that the Trump administration would do anything agains any big corperation
zelz	I ’ m in the UK so forgive me but how the hell do people afford drug that ’ ll cost more than a car in total each year
Thomas Turner	I feel rather skeptical and wonder if the reason Trump s going after this particular issue is most likely because he s on prescription himself so it s one of the few issue that pertains to him I feel so cynical about everything involving him
prof shad	Wow a bill that really wont do anything
Mitchell Lerich	Coma or Death a these may become permanent No shit Sherlock
Emily	This is actually a really smart move Good job government you finally did your job But why don t we just ban TV drug commercial altogether
Desirae Baker	Out of curiosity who think to ask of drug price while they are at the doctor s office I can imagine most don t get offered that information nor do they ask for more They just accept the prescription move on
Alexander Koolen	I worl for a drug company The price will not be lowered Because people need those med Sooooo you want to live beyond the age of 40 That will be 50 a month Too expensive Well Good luck These company ask high price because they can people will pay to be health and a country where healthcare is so terrible a the u Consumers will get f ed
Daniel Dickison	There wa a time when your doctor told you the medication you need Now day you tell your doctor the medication you need Fortunately I trust my doctor They always prescribe the non name brand if it exists I just don t feel pharmaceutical company should be pushing drug directly to the patient over the head of your doctor It s your doctor s job to know what you need
LV223	I think this will be good for consumer I m a nurse and have heard too many story about people who have had to pick between getting their medication or paying their utility bill My brother used to work in an eye surgery cataract office where they literally tell the staff when they are setting people up for their prescription to only set them up with generic if they make a specific point of asking for them It make a seriously vast difference in price most of these people are elderly on fixed income frankly don t know much about healthcare and med so they don t know to ask for them Hopefully this will help some people
Golgiapparatus2	I mean I don t think prescription drug should be advertised in the first place but getting more transparency is always a good thing for the consumer As much a I dislike the Trump admin I can not fault this move
Ravensidentity	Yeah that s pretty dumb That mean more frustrated people calling Admin to cuss u out for not having the same price on TV which could wind up being more or le depending upon insurance There s going to be a lot of argument between Billing and patient if they do this I see lot of law suit coming forth too This is a bad idea for so many reason
MACKS	Drug company are like the Mafia Its your money or your life
Brandon McCampbell	Hey is this Trump ’ s Office doing something redeeming Honestly if he kept doing thing that are beneficial to EVERYONE like this people might not hate him As much
fleshTH	Yeah that would be very confusing and what they ll end up doing is something like what Life Insurance doe All you have to pay is 0 30 per unit what is a unit who know but it will technically make sense is the most absurd way and will still cost 500
Jaykuan Medina	Morning show is a hige plus for me
Erin Collective	healthcare should be free this is a joke
Luke McGhee	Got ta love those side effect in the ad “ if you have an errection for four hour call your doctor ” Though not a bad a anal leakage stroke and temporary blindness Hearing lowered price Kind of seems hard It ’ s like when I visited the optometrist office and looking at glass They ’ re generally owned by one company Most medication is owned by a handful of pharmaceutical company Meds would be cheaper if not for greed and cost to advertise something beneficial I personally don ’ t use any med to treat anything Though I can imagine if a person with severe illness deserves to pay lower not high for better health
Trevor Jones	That is a surprisingly smart move from this administration
phillip smith	i think the biggest question in that is something Phill glossed over it would allow the government to purchase the right to perscriptions I get it would slash price but wouldn t it allow the government to control what medicare medicaid will cover
SmackThatMoose	I m glad to see that the administration is actually doing something about a real issue for average American citizen Makes me think that for once they re trying to do their job
Alcoholic Atheist	I m for the complete and total ban of direct marketing of prescription drug People need to directly talk with their doctor about what may or may not be right for their particular situation without the bias of having seen it on television first The wide range of effect that drug can have on the human body is something so complicated that expert can study it for year and still not be able to predict what those drug might do By all mean do some research on the internet be well informed but blasting commercial at people all day claiming to be able to make them better isn t the answer What happens is that people will do to doctor and try to demand certain drug perhaps thinking falsely they know it will work or just simply hope that they ll feel better
Justin Stuber	Your drug price are so high because British and Canadians like me have strong armed your drug company into giving u cheaper price because otherwise our nationalized healthcare would collapse completely instead of the slow collapse we have now Thanks
BrandonOfTheFence	Didn t know anything about this new proposal love yo face Phil You an your crew are doing amazing thing right now and the benefit is widespread across your side and our side a the viewer Thank you for continuing to put u in the know yall rock
Fabby Marmol	I think we need to work towards lowering the demand for pharmaceutical a opposed to lowering their price and potentially increasing demand Yet I think that this proposal should it actually become enforced would have an overall positive impact
Drill Mcenzyme	As a physician I have to say TRUMP IS THE MAN
Blazing Nipples	I think this is a token effort to create a talking point for the mid term I don t think it address the real problem at hand That said it s progress
Trevor Hauck	Wait 7 of 10 Americans are on at least 1 prescription drug I think I might be sick
ENORMP	let talk about Canada s legalization of marijuana big pharma isn t happy
orangeoranges11	phil why do you not think i am beautiful anymore
Alex Reitan	I used to joke with my doctor where I say TV told me to ask my doctor about and I just list every treatment out there
Richard Moreno	Morning vids are appreciated
RJ Maksym	Yes this is good drug company take advantage of those who need there drug they make Billions it time they see some regulation
Joel Porter	1 07 coma or death a these side effect may become permanent What company is this UMBRELLA
PeaNuT BuTTer	Now that i think about it my doctor ha never discussed the price of my medicine with me Once i showed up to the pharmacy and wa shocked to see that i had to pay 700 for some anti depressant It wa brand name but i wa allergic to the generic I switched my med up because of all of that
The New Krio	The fact that Trump is doing this is actually really huge It s a big thing in his favor
BlueBoyof08	Honestly drug should not even be advertise like how the US is doing it There s a reason why only 2 country are allowing advertisement of prescription drug
Jean Peter	a a guy who used to be on latuda and who gf constantly tell him to go back on it this vid hit my soul
matthew styles	Wow from the past with trump I dont think this is his direct doing But prop where it is do Good on em
David Thorogood	Holy shit trump and Congress propose something that actually is right I do believe this will have the effect of causing company to lower their cost because the listed price from one company may be undercut by another or another company may see this and say hey we could make that cheaper This is likely to foster competition in the marketplace
aberon	1 08 or death a these may be permanent are you telling me DEATH IS PERMANENT crazy talk
jdawghatesyou	The whole debate around big pharma ha been raging for a long time For me a I learn more I get more question This is pretty much par for the course because a the late Enrico Fermi said before your lecture I wa confused After your lecture I am still confused but on a higher level I get that the research synthesis and testing of new drug is wildly expensive and time consuming You have a variety of people from Universities and private company working tirelessly to create new thing to help people but that cost money so there ha to be backing So I get the need to advertise and get the word out But on the flip side when you see the skyrocketing price of some drug that started cheap and ended up ridiculous I become apprehensive There are a lot of moving part at work here and I am afraid we just don t have enough information to really know how any of this effect progress of new technology and new treatment The truth is for me that I have no idea what to think I don t want people to pay a lot for their drug but I also realize that maybe it s warranted Also people in this country are way too dependent and addicted to their drug because there aren t better alternative because all the good one are placed in Schedule 1 status by the government So I have no idea what to think anymore haha I need a nap
Jettaboo	Could you also cover the hospital that are banning together to start their own prescription drug company It ’ s genius they have gotten fed up with big pharma always increasing price on the drug they need most and will now be making and distributing their own and with contract others can be assured the price will stay the same no matter what Love seeing all these change in the pharmaceutical industry particularly a a consumer who each month encounter a new excuse a to why they ’ re raising my medication by 50 100 buck it ’ s getting extremely out of hand and harder to obtain
Brittany G.	The opposition to this new price addition is betting on the fact that prescription user are stupid uneducated If an ad list the drug price at 100 month OF COURSE that s NOT including insurance coverage That s why you would need to discus the drug with your doctor and the cost with your insurance I dont understand why the opposition is using the consumer will be misguided by the cost excuse when the majority of Americans know the price will differ already and it s not even a strong argument
OdexByzantine James Di Lorenzo	I personally use vitamin I don t believe in medication
CaptainCanada780	Drug company admittedly can not reveal a list price for their product because they charge insurance company hospital and people at different rate I would be curious to know if the best drug rebate went to insurance company and hospital that drug company were steakholders in Would revealing a list price on drug also bring into question antitrust law based on pricing strategy
Cody Knight	Like stated in the video the issue is too complex to provide price figure in a television commercial Every individual insurance plan is extremely unique and ha a varied formulary and tier system associated with it As a current pharmacy school student with over five year in the work environment I have seen the astronomical wholesale price of drug at it worst and insurance company s refusal to cover the cost of them on the contrary I have seen insurance plan approve astronomical amount although it often take some problem solving by the pharmacist to achieve this A good pharmacist will work to provide the best care for the patient and this includes finding an affordable treatment option often time the insurance company will not provide enough information to a consumer to choose the cheapest treatment option and it turn into a trial and error process between the prescriber and pharmacy adding yet another level of complexity to the issue is the use of drug manufacture coupon I feel a if a small portion of the population is aware of the potential manufacture rebate that can be obtained to make their medication affordable They often think and are told by their pharmacy that if insurance ha paid on the medication that is the bottom dollar price this is often not true Although there are a lot of financial avenue to negate the price they almost never work with federally or state funded insurance plan this leaf the patient that are usually in the most need for the expensive brand name drug covered by Medicare or Medicaid ineligible for this price break overall my recommendation would be to find a pharmacy and a pharmacist near you that is going to fight on your behalf and work with you to get you the care that you need I have a strong opinion that this level of care is more prevalent in an independent pharmacy over a chain pharmacy I avoid making that blanket statement that every pharmacist at a chain pharmacy won ’ t go out of their way to help the patient but often time in the independent pharmacy the pharmacist behind the counter ha a vested interest in building a personal relationship with each patient The common misconception that drug are cheaper at large chain pharmacy is flat out untrue aside from the Wal Mart 4 List that is heavily advertised Although this sound like an amazing price most independent drug store will work with you to achieve the same price point on those drug TLDR Find a pharmacist that will go to bat for you and this becomes a non issue Try an independent pharmacy if you are unhappy with your experience at a chain pharmacy
sargentrowell81	Wow I had no idea that death may become permanent
Sonyaliloquy	If the pharma industry hate it it s probably a good idea
Radical Centrist	OH NO NOT PERMANENT DEATH 😱
Dana Moeskau	Poor pharma gon na lose some money boohoo
Nathan Samuelson	I actually like this idea By being forced to show the standard price company at least on some level will have to try harder to stay competitive with each other I doubt it ll slash prescription price but 10 20 le is a huge boon for some people Idk if business shaming is really a good motivator but fine or penalty could be
LowQ	The big bad Orange Man save the average American person even more money and time Gee wiz it s almost a if he s been doing this consistently since 2016
Limp Wibbler	I hate the drug company and more the way the U S handle prescription drug They are way too expensive way too accessible way too normalized and not that beneficial in many case The people who truly need drug need the expensive dug The people who don t need drug are given drug The avg take drug and everyone see it a ok Many time the drug fix a non issue I for example should be having a few prescription doctor recommended I wa suppose to take something for heart burn omeprazole which is a drug and that wa 6 year ago when I wa 15 I can not believe they wanted to give a 15 year old drug Anyways I said no then and ever since then I simply have a tum when my heart burn act up No big deal yet doctor recommended drug I also have Dermatophagia which is when you bite your skin and Trichophagia when you eat your hair when long enough These are ICD which is basically OCD There are ton of medication for OCD I can take them to help me OR I can just bite my skin So what I bleed 1 time a week it hurt a bit but not much At least I am not reliant on a substance to live All I m saying is yes medication is needed but people treat small problem a too large Just accept a problem and deal with it instead of blocking it out You will only make the small thing into worse at that point
HylianSwordsman1	This won t lower drug price much if at all if you haven t noticed drug company are completely shameless and thus can t be shamed but the transparency is still very welcome This is one of the best thing to come out of this administration
missxvincent	If it s going to be advertised it should be done across the board not just in TV ad Especially for the millenials who are killing everything including cable TV package
Brian Rizzo	As usual I liked the content here but I did think some of the graphic used were a little campy I appreciate getting more news from you every day and I hope this new segment is successful
hawksafe	Drug company are drug dealer Its obvious that shaming drug company for the price of a drug while their user are already hooked is not the same at all compared to what the law purpose Drug dealer are always more negotiable on the price before they know you need it That s the game
Jason	While some company will lower their price most won t This is not enough incentive for them to do so
HITYR PRODUCTIONS	I worked at a call center that provided copay assistance for expensive drug Patients wouldnt know any information about how much the drug wuld cost and sometimes wouldnt be allowed to know until AFTER taking the drug We couldnt tell them pricing either because the price varies and there isnt a set base price we could even say With this at least there would be sort of a base price in the patient s head they could see before jumping in Its a step in the right direction imo
Aaron Deifel	I think it ’ s a first step but more would need to be done
Munchausenification	The more transparentcy there is the better Good move from the Trump administration even though they are far and few in between
secret pieperson	Lol Americans have to pay for health
Wolveast	People are not stupid you can just put the price average or the price you use when doctor buying them
Colin Campbell	I think you forgot the whole lack of our ability to negotiate down drug in this country It doesn t have anything to do with the amount of money pharmaceutical company lobby Congress though Totally irrelevant to the amount of money people pay for drug Edit Forgot that there is a whole host of problem with this proposal Yes it would require them to post the list price of the drug but 99 of people pay nowhere near that cost Different insurance cover different amount Medicaid and Medicare have there own independent system and often time you can get discount if you can not afford the medication All this proposal really doe is nothing No enforcement mechanism no real benefit to consumer and no real fix for what the real problem is with prescription drug This strike me a being more of a way for the administration to try and lean people towards them in the midterm The Democratic Party is heavily focused on health care for the midterm and is pushing hard against Republicans in all corner of the country This really is more a political move than an actual policy
renragged	I think my wife s Rx cost each year is around 3000 That s just for the script all her doctor visit have 35 and 45 co pay Stay healthy kid Don t get overweight because it ll cost you big time later in life
Thefilth	Ok Sorry But you CAN NOT compare the price of pharmaceutical to the price of car Cars are a luxury Pharmaceuticals are not supposed to be a luxury To people who actually need them they are essential As Phil correctly pointed out the US is one of the only place on earth where ad for medicine even exist They re almost universally banned and with good reason It s in the best interest of the citizen and the government to regulate the pharmaceutical industry and this is a step in the right direction I still cringe at the comparison though
JohnyTechReview	This seems like a right move to help consumer From trump Yes I ’ m fking skeptical Give me the catch
Divya	i feel a though the fact that a long a pharmaceutical industry is allowed to be a capitalist system drug price will remain elevated beyond the reach of normal people I am a pharmacist and work with several patient with lower economic status One of the biggest challenge to compliance is the price of medication I think it would be awesome for pharmaceutical company to have SOME accountability for the fact that they make their medication so beyond the reach of a normal patient that the patient ha to choose between bill and their health Not sure how advertising is going to make much of a difference in accountability but maybe transparency will elicit public outrage enough to make a social change in the way that big pharma is allowed to manage price
Corrupted Puppet	Doubtful that they would change their pricing They d probably do what car commercial do you know Get a rebate or so much off is credit is good or what not lol
Sadientra	Just ban medication ad Boom
Carissa Petersen	I ’ m actually all for this I ’ m someone who depends on several medication especially for depression and I hate medical advertising Advertising that a drug can give your best life is just gon na get more people dependent on them that don ’ t need them while there are million that do There are plenty of way to get medicine to patient and the best way is in knowing that if 98 percent of the population get sick they will hightail it to the doctor to get medicine Those who don ’ t have a reason like a lack of insurance past experience or mental health I hope this go through Even if it may seem confusing at least it is a start
Lord Voldemort	Where i live 100 pill of my depression medication cost me around 5 euro and when I went to pharmacy they actually ASKED me if I wanted the cheaper alternative of the drug When I didn t work for a couple of month last year I got them for free
Ryan bbhee	I love morning show
CaptainJesi	It s a little hypocritical when Republicans take so much money in from special interest
jack santos	Even though im not affected by this this is fantastic
Dennis Tamayori	I m in the 70 boooooo
Yiṣḥāq David	1 buy them from Canada
Joshua W	I wish Phil would phil me in more often if you know what I mean nudge nudge sex
Jordan Neal	My mind is blown by the punishment behind breaking the law It is very uncharacteristic of the federal government to use such non violent mean to accomplish their end
argella1300	We don ’ t need a requirement that drug company advertise the price of their product What will make drug cheaper is making new drug patent law that make it possible to release generic earlier
Dashi Adriel	Coma or death these may be permanent really I thought death wa temporary
Roman Hashon	Jerad polis ad
Curtis Schultz	I believe that Dr ’ s are rewarded for prescribing drug rather than finding a permanent solution to the problem Prescriptions are like merchandise to YouTubers Why fix the problem with one or two visit when you can treat it long term with multiple visit and prescription This would be even more prevalent if we were to go to social health care system I know that to be true because it I see it in the military
Devil RedHD	America get british and create a NHS already your flue medication cost a arm and a both leg
Kirsten Curran	If I ever watch an American ad for some type of legal drug I find it so weird and almost funny it ’ s so ridiculous
jonnyA0112	I understand what your saying about Medicare spending outside of doctor office but are these stats adding in treatment center I need to get iv ig two day a month and that end up adding up to 4 grand a month So again that Medicare stat ha to be adding in treatment center dispensing chemo blood product ect That s where they re paying the most
Nina Gabrielle	What a mess
Sinnan Momin	Damn this is actually great
Woman InTech	Clearly Trump doe not have money in Pharma
Bunny Becca	They are doing this for vote Just like how right now in MD they are paving road in a red county that doesn ’ t even need it when Baltimore county desperately need the improvement to their road The only silver lining is if it becomes a law and impossible for drug company to comply then they can ’ t put advertisement on TV anymore
Evan Sweeney	I think this is a way to make the trump adminstration look like there doing something relevant
Julien Rebic	Opinion While freedom of speech matter it s in conflict with freedom of association How could someone truly consent to a contract is they are not informed of the consequence or are lied to by omission Furthermore I have a hard time believing in the validity of a contract if it can t be realistically fulfilled To avoid extortion Although a consumer we still have the responsibly to inform ourselves and not always rely on these company to do it for u
David Tyler	what of exposure do tv ad have these day i mean compared to all the other unaffected form of communication i d bet that the true impact of this rule is minimal
Arron Aim	call your doctor if death cause it might be permanent yes yes Death is a side effect lol
TheGamerJaredHD	I like the idea trump
vVAstrAVv	This sound awesome No WAY it passing
StoicSwordsman	Big issue with big pharma
Kenzee Harmon	This is fabulous I am pleasantly surprised by this move by Trump Big Pharma need to be held accountable for some of their bullshit The Next Step would be banning ad like this all together though
Patron	DRUMPF is a nightmare He is LITERALLY a thousand time more vile and evil than any hubeing in all of recorded Herstory Hitler ha NOTHING on Drumpf DRUUUUMMMMPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFF
A H	As a type 1 juvenile insulin dependent diabetic who need Insulin to live every day I have to pay a lot of money just to stay alive I m for this change and any other change that lower my insulin cost
Jamie Brown	Just glad that trump ha pushed for something I actually support it ’ s about fucking time
Sara G	After watching the dirty money episode on prescription drug I can see where they are going with this If they lower the cost of prescription they can in turn make insurance rate lower If they are unable to lower prescription medication rate this way then there need to be legal cap on how much a certain medicine could cost The cost of prescription is the reason insurance rate have gone up in recent year
skitx31	Lol “ coma or death a they may become permanent ” didn ’ t know death could be temporary
Jesus Gonzalez	I don t think it ll change much if anything at all but now hopefully it ll keep the ball rolling and something can be done about pharmaceutical company in general For example the ridiculously high price some of them charge for necessary drug or just the amount of lobbying they can do
lost_ranger	My wife s med are 5 000 a dose I d love to them throw that price out there in an Ad
captainyourmom	How about medication isn t a fucking product and they shouldn t be shamelessly marketed to the mass in the first place This is smoke and mirror policy by the way It look good and pro patient but doe nothing to solve the real problem while at the same time make Trump look like he actually give a shit As long a big pharm pay off our politician expect very little to change
AlmostSober	Expand it Put their price everywhere
ErikTheRed33	I approve of what the trump administration is trying to do here Just felt like I would see what it felt like to say that
Angelica Simon	I stopped taking a lot of medication because now that I moved out from my parent house and have to pay rent and bill I can ’ t risk spending too much on medicine that I feel I can ’ t function without I have depression and chronic pain I used lidocaine patch that are 200 per box of 30 patch It ’ s too difficult to try to save that up each month Other patch don ’ t work Something my family started doing wa getting them in bulk after our copay wa met and then using them sparingly We did this with inhaler too The only issue is then you don ’ t always use them when you need to thinking “ but what if I ’ ll need it more later ” and it expires
Lord R	Permanent Death 1 07
JustAHorrorShow	Finally some political news that doesn t make me want to dismember myself
Jennifer Swarbrick	Infringe upon 1st amendment right Someone please explain Stephen Ubl s statement about that As well a the long legal fight ahead is that a direct threat to the government that if they do this they will keep it tied up in the court for year so it never actually happens I m Canadian so I m genuinely curious a to what this will mean for the average American
Megan Hall	So in those long commercial is it an issue for them to say thing like Many insurance plan can cover some to all of this medication Check with your insurance company to see what they can cover I mean if it wa something I felt I needed I m pretty sure I d check with my insurance to see how much of it would get covered and if not all I would see if there were any option that were more affordable
Modern Michael	Very animated text this episode 🤪
Kirinketsu	I do not see how this would lower drug price most people take drug based on what their doctor tell them to take not a TV For a good two year now all but three state Alabama Ohio and Vermont have had law in that a pharmacy must substitute a name brand drug for cheaper generic drug unless the customer asks for the name brand drug The issue is there are no profit or margin attached to product thrust company can charge whatever they want for their product Medical and Pharmaceuticals should have a set profit and margin limit set by the government or state limiting margin to under 200 and not in the 1000 like nearly every Medical and Pharmaceuticals product is at these item are meant to help people save life keep people alive and people should not have to worry if they can afford to go to a Hospital or buy what might be life saving drug they need to take for the rest of their life to survive The medical field ha margin normally around 2 000 to 5 000 and can sometimes be a high a 10 000 to 20 000 this is why your hospital visit and pharmaceutical cost so much Typical a pill that cost say 20 cent to make will be sold for 2 to 4 this doesn t sound bad until you realize you need to take 10 30 60 of that pill a month and in some case pill that cost anywhere from 20 cent 2 or 7 to make are sold for outrageous price 30 100 500 over 1 000 and most of the time these are lifesaving drug that an individual ha to take for the rest of their life to survive When it come to a hospital if you need a pill such a an aspirin it could cost 10 to 60 Tetanus vaccine in some area have cost 300 to 1 300 for a shot you can get at WalMart for like 60 glove the doctor use when seeing you can cost 5 to 10 a pair each use the box cost about that those wood stick also called tongue depressor if they are not wood look for them costing you 50 on your bill if they did use a wood one it might only be 10 you need a tissue that could be 8 a towel could cost you 80 to 120 600 for band aid 300 for four gauzespads the best I have seen is 800 for a bag of salt water and these are all small item this doe not count the 1000 for operating tool that cost le than 100 or the price of imagery that can be in the 1000 if you break your arm or leg and need a rod or screw the price you pay just for a few screw or the rod could fund your trip to fly to another country and have the operation done there while also having a relaxing recovery vaction after the reason why you pay so outrageous price is that most hospital write off 40 50 of what they charge due to people who come in by the Emergency room most do not have insurance and will never pay the outrageous 10 000 to 200 000 bill or the person dy while in the hospital so they claim they have to charge people so much to cover these lost fund hopping most people will have insurance to take the hit but most insurance only cover 70 of the bill it just insane that a 10 000 hospital bill in other 1st world country that do not offer universal health care can only cost 600 to 2 000 for the same treatment A MRI in American cost around 1 100 the same MRI with the same mechince can cost a little a 200 to 500 in other 1st world countires WTF
Fluffymiyster	Any time I have to get a prescription if I m sick I always ask for the generic version Never go name brand unless you have to A few week ago I had a bad chest cold walking pneumonia and had to get two prescription I forgot to ask for the generic version this time but the pharmacy did it for me one of my two medicine being a generic for Allegra for allergy I wa told to also take cough syrup and the box state it may cause allergy like symptom The other one that wasn t made generic wa cheap enough with my insurance for it not to matter if it wa namebrand As it wa just an antibiotic I actually don t think it fell into either category neither namebrand or off brand It wa just a medicine
mfauz96	Thank you again for the quick and factual news that you have always provided to u I love watching your show for my news and I will always watch your show
Dionne West	This regulation would be toothless 90 of a pharmaceutical company ’ s advertising budget is dedicated to promoting to doctor Doctors are incentivized to prescribe a certain brand regardless of if the patient need it or not I do however like the idea of the government being able to negotiate lower prescription drug price for consumer
Dianna Castaneda	I love the extra morning show Thank you
Vmt16	Am I missing something here Because to me this seems like one of the few good move the Trump administration ha made This is absolutely a step in the right direction
Nathaniel Gillie	Pharmaceutical company shouldn t be able to have add that s what you go to the doctor for Also it s kind of scummy how much mark up they charge for thing that can save people life Wheres the regulation on the price gouging
ShoalBear	Coma or death a these may become permanent ummm can I choose the non permanent death 🙄🤣
Jasper van Leeuwen	Why am I watching this I m from Europe lol
John Geddes	but if the government wanted full transparency then the pricing information should be on all format i mean using automobile a the comparison like used in the story you will find the MSRP listed in tv newspaper magazine and website ad so if you want true transparency for big Pharma then it should be across the board but thats just my 2 cent worth
Anna Galindo-Kent	I have chronic health issue and unfortunately prescription medication is a part of my everyday life I have crappy insurance on top of everything I need pharmaceutical price to go down I would agree with these company to have to disclose there price but I think they should have to give price on every platform Saying they only have to give price on basically only tv commercial is not going to do much when almost all the people I know don ’ t watch live tv It should extend to all social medium platform since that ’ s how the majority of people my age consume their news now With all that said I would be happy if we could get them to lower the price no matter how it ha to happen No matter what it ’ s a frustrating situation I literally can ’ t live without certain medication like insulin because I ’ m a type 1 diabetic but I have no choice and I ’ m going to go broke because I ’ m paying hundred of dollar every month
Abiy BattleSpell	The whole putting pricing in ad is a legit waste of time Five buks if u need any dese drug ur gon na first talk bout ur option with ur doc then pricing And the small print on dese ad are so small and fast tht no one ever read em And actually the point of price varying is kinda half ok Maby instead of listing a set price list the average low to high cost Like u may spend 20 30 buks a an example However the only ad i can see this info being useful in is non video one
‹depression autopilot›	So who should I call during my coma or death to keep it from becoming permanent Anyway I m a liberal leaning moderate and I say good on President Trump Everyone should be able to critique what they disagree with praise what they do agree with and not have to listen to the constant fear mongering I hope he truly continues to pursue this 🙂
gabriel jimenez	It ’ s bullshit there are even drug commercial
Nathan Carlson	I can t wait to see all the leftist suddenly pulling a 180 and vehemently opposing Trump s violent attack on Big Pharma Loooooooool Beep boop orange man bad beep
Alex Janowicz	Maybe instead of making them list the raw price of the drug they should have it list what the average consumer of that drug actually pay for it after insurance
Hello Guy	Love morning show thing 👍
josh1000100	This is the step in the right direction for the country One we shouldn ’ t have drug advertisement anyway They tell you to ask your doctor so your doctor isn ’ t the one offering the drug of company they are Getting money from
David Daniels	This is a good move here Howe Eric there will be reluctance on changing price To me that would have to be mandated by the government to oversee the price That in itself could be seen a too much however if you are able to get a generic brand of the same medication for cheaper the consumer will go for the cheaper option This is a good step however I feel that it might be neccessary to go a little further with this
humanitarkamkd	The sound is awful what happened
Dartheious Dator	Rx can never fail They re the biggest multibillion industry there is Transparency will be good for their ego
lilsquirrely	At the end of the day how I feel about it is The drug company shouldn t be arguing anything and literally put their money or cost where their mouth is if they re so confident in advertising lifesaving medication that people might need then they shouldn t be ashamed or have anything to be afraid of putting their price in an ad
Miru StClair	A good start I ’ m glad something is happening but something ha to be done about drug company price gouging patient Epipen would be a fantastic example of this It ’ s insanity
Acacia Rogers Art	IMO i think this is a great idea Big Pharma ha been allowed to to pull bullshit behind closed door and scam the world for far too long They know the transparency would affect their ability to do that And let face it People are in fact buying drug they dont need to bandaid an issue they could deal with in a healthier way Maybe that wouldnt be the case if people were more aware of drug cost Also Phil i love the morning show idea
G mac	Is this secondary show meant to justify the 70 000 a month your patreon contributor pay for you to create a News Network Can we have more accountability a to what you re doing and when thing are going to happen Otherwise this is a bigger scam than betterhelp
Kristina Maakestad	Like this kind of content Phil Still waiting on an update for the online counseling service
Anxiety Ebriety	I don t watch tv and I don t do the drug
Coercitor 626	Free Healthcare Think about the people who supposedly have “ GOOD INSURANCE ” but end up in hundred of thousand of dollar in debt because they ’ re insurance doesn ’ t cover certain benefit It ’ s very sad to see family crash
Quniverse	I hope it go through
digger4400	I for one like the morning video and would like to keep seeing them in the future
Lord Kife	Damn Surprised I m gon na say this but trump administration doing some good
Raspberries	I d feel much more like something wa being done in the interest of the consumer if this idea were coupled with a ban on incentive and the pharma company were no longer permitted to deliver payouts to doctor prescribing their brand of a drug In many case patient are not informed of cheaper alternative
John Spencer	lol hey this phd from harvard doesn t know what ll happen so what s you r take frank
Brannagan O'Brannagan	Good information Phill I ve trusted you since the beginning thanks
Dildi Pinkoos	u pay for ur medication LOL murica
Dragonkinn	This seems like a good move forward I think there are a few thing to adjust 1 If they end up on the shame list all commercial get full advert watermark denoting their non compliance 2 While listing negative effect during this time they should post cost of top 3 alternative or to some way to show Cost and Side Effects a a comparison Sure this impedes their right to free speech but they are not a person they are a corporation and they should not be allowed to lie or conceal thing
Zeke McFreak	I am surprised that the administration is going this direction but the only punishment for not following the law is to be on a list and shamed is a laughable punishment for multibillion dollar company that have already shown that they dont care in many case
MurkedStat	FreeShkreli we need him more than ever right now
Oscar Nunez Films	How doe being asked to disclose the price of your medication infringe your first amendment right You have the freedom of speech not the freedom to withhold known information a a corporation A business must comply with the regulation set by the government Transparency for the consumer is a good thing It s like these drug lobbyist know they re robbing people and they don t want to be scrutinized No constitutional debate necessary here That s a weak argument bro This is one thing Trump is doing that I actually like👍🏽
Astarothpool17	So it only affect tv ad wow just in the nick of time while TV itself is on life support lol
Jase_LV	This might be the only thing I can say with 100 certainty the Trump administration did well Next thing that should happen is banning on prescription medicine advertisement If you need a drug a doctor will prescribe it not a tv commercial
DiscoPrince906	I think we would all benefit from more transparent medicen
sean craighead	Consumers shouldn t need to go to their doctor to get the drug they need If they need a drug for treatment of an ailment their doctor should be advising them on it not the other way around Part of a doctor s job is understanding your ailment and the Pharmaceuticals that may help treat it They re more qualified for advising and weighing good and bad effect of drug
MrStif Productions	Awesome thanks P D
Kayle Washington	This is the first time I ve ever been impressed by the action of this administration it s a strange feeling
Redpy5	People aren t questioning why price are so high really You d prefer to pay more so that they can keep advertising at you and bribing doctor so long a it s transparent How about we limit marketing budget and stop shitty business practice Between that and paying attention to executive wage we might actually be able to get price lower but capitalism requires growth in some regard so we aren t likely to see change
Zion McFadden	This isnt the real phil Phil would never start a show without calling me a beautiful bastard
Evilrose0611	Dont pas that law or else we can t gouge your insurance company for every penny we can
MrTorkxx	Now i get to wake up to a video too EARLY CHRISTMAS
Ploopy678	As a pharmacy student I personally do not think medicine should be advertised at all That being said at least this is an improvement from the previous system so good job to Trump on this one
Jaycee Williams	Coma or death a these may become permanent Well i mean it s death lol😂 there ain t no respawn in the real world
Jesse S	Yes So happy these morning show are back
Callie Bedard	Coma or death a these may become permanent lmao you think
MnM	Hmm Alright Let ’ s get into this I ’ m a type one diabetic I have to get insulin all the time No matter what i do I need insulin With that said I have attempted to find out the COST of producing the insulin I take two type A long and a short acting Both made by different insulin pharma company IPC I ’ ve contacted them both and asked what price they sell the insulin to the insurance company IC here in the USA They can not answer that question because different IC get it at different price So I asked about my IC pricing They referred me to my IC When prodded further about their COST to produce said insulin they said they can ’ t give me answer about that because “ it varies ” How I don ’ t know and they wouldn ’ t explain further than “ it ’ s the material needed to produce the insulin that can fluctuate ” I don ’ t think that ’ s the case but I ’ m not the one making insulin so I don ’ t know I think one of the main issue is insurance company They need to pay a certain amount of the cost of the rx So in turn the distributor hike up the price to get more out of the IC because they will only get a small percentage from the consumer When I get insulin it cost me almost 200 a month Insurance is currently around 202 a week I go see the doctor every 6 month and have a 50 copay plus what ever blood work I need to get done which is typically about 100 150 Blood strip measuring the glucose level is the generic type by my pharmacy 15 a month I miss work sometimes to be able to control my glucose level Although I ’ m very lucky and can work from home if need be and I also take very good care of myself We need to redo the healthcare system Make it so you pay the doctor Not the IC Use IC a supplemental insurance Not the one you rely on The doctor will then compete for the better pricing The market will drastically level out and down Also I ’ m not an economist I have no education or training I have absolutely no idea what that would do to the US I ’ m sure it would throw thing for quite a loop But I do think that the IC have gotten out of hand They are far too expensive and the price of regular care is insane yet alone what it ’ s like for a person like me who ha a life long chronic decease
TheReclusive	This is the stupidest way to try to lower drug price which trump care nothing about helping the common person save money Insurance doe heavily effect what you pay because of our broken healthcare system so price on the ad won ’ t help 9 10 if there ’ s a generic people are getting that over name brand since it ’ s usually way cheaper This is just a frivolous thing to fight for Also big pharma ha a leg to stand on by saying it go against their first amendment right a the court ruled company are “ people ” because company ran by ultra religious group didn ’ t want to pay for birth control or abortion via insurance for their employee these company often paid minimum wage too how Christian of them lol So yeah we live in a country where monolith of greed are seen a more of a person than an actual individual That ’ s far more disturbing than ad for drug on tv imo
Erickenriquee	Just a comment passing by
SimonsAdventures	Wow trump actually did something good
JaySee5	Americans need to see MORE PRICES ESPECIALLY those that are covered by their insurance so they see why insurance is so stupid expensive Hospital and drug price being transparent will help reduce insurance cost
BlackSheepDisciple	For 8 year I wa on an infusion treatment Every 4 week for 8 year 28 000 a treatment It ’ s insane Found out I shouldn ’ t have even been on it
Desiree de la Pena	I ’ m actually surprised they don ’ t already tell u how much the drug is
RoverStorm	Although I am fairly anti advertisement it ha a long history in American s history If we must keep it these requirement seems fair Anyone who isn t confused by the advertisement themselves definitely won t be confused by price being included This probably won t solve the horrific corruption around the epipens though
Jon W.	Some pharma company might not be swayed by advertising the price because they are the only drug available to do what they do However I do hope that will encourage other pharma company to look at those ad and see if they not only can make something similar but also cheaper
Baddassbecca on IG	I ’ m happy the Trump administration is doing thing to try to take down the power of big pharma surprising to say the least I ’ m all for it
pie lama	They have to display price on TV ad but not internet ad Sounds completely useless to me how many ppl even still watch TV anymore were all on the internet It s just a move to make ppl think oh Trump is doing so much for this country just before the midterm they ALL do this crap
paper kay	Ah Americans They ll buy anything if a hot enough commercial is made about it Even poison
Annabeth Chase	Wouldn t a simple counter argument to the insurance argument be Drug company can announce that price may vary below the list price or for that matter why don t they announce it on their website Their reluctance to do that show how effective those channel of information conveyance actually are a opposed to the TV ad I m all for the transparency of information
groundbreaker91	Big pharma company are some of the most corrupt and greedy company out there As Phil said in the show 70 of Americans are on some form prescription medication Some people desperately need these medication just to function in every day life Yet these company charge outrageous price for their medication Without some form of insurance prescription med are typically thousand of dollar to buy And now that regulation is starting to come their way all the big pharma company are trying to act like they re the good guy and doing a service for people in need when in reality they re just robbing them blind
Nkunu Nuglozeh	This is a good move
Cynthia Mote	I would just like to make sure every one know that they can ask their doctor if there is a non formulary equivalent to the medication This is similar to buying the off brand of an over the counter pill Some insurance company ’ s are more likely to cover these than the name brand The more you know
Bryan Diaz	I may not be a fan of the Trump administration and the their several decision but this this is something I can get behind with
Dale Hurtt	If the drug company are afraid of it then generally speaking I am for it If their excuse is primarily that it would cause confusion then I consider that not a valid reason for providing pricing transparency
TheDragonLegacy	Why only on TV it s probably one of the lesser medium stream Internet ad such place like youtube should have price displayed too seen a few but not many medication ad
Crismodin	Drug and medical company always use this excuse Well the cost depends on your medical plan Let me tell you right now it doesn t The whole thing is a giant scam I realized this with my father year ago we were both about to have an operation relatively same insurance we were using the same doctor he got quoted 400 I got quoted 1800 The doctor said the base price change depending on your insurance when asked what the price is out of pocket the doctor said It depends on each individual circumstance That s code for we just make shit up a we go to see how much we can rob from medical insurance company I went to a big hospital chain in Arizona Banner for an ER visit simple GI related procedure 7500 I went to the same big hospital chain in a city over for another ER visit mind you exact same healthcare chain same exact procedure and circumstance 3250 same exact insurance both time They are just winging it they re making shit up a they go and I bet doctor are just sitting around rolling the dice on how much they can write down and get away with
ToxicHyena	I love this idea but not at all because it is likely to lower price of medication The very reason that PHRMA think we shouldn t do this is exactly why we should do this If a consumer is confused THEY LOOK UP RELATED INFORMATION So many people don t understand insurance and what kind of coverage they re paying for By adding this aspect of transparency to the mix people will inevitably become more aware of their situation and hopefully be driven to make better informed decision not just about medication but also about healthcare in general The biggest problem in healthcare is that the bulk of information about healthcare is behind a curtain not everyone ha the ability to see around transparency in the industry will only make it better
pythonkatie K	Having worked in a pharmacy for a few year one thing that should be taken into consideration is sometimes it ’ s the insurance company that is the bad guy in regard to pricing There can actually be time when your insurance company charge you more for medication then the cash price would be for it It is not often but it doe happen An easy way for drug company to get around this rule would be saying “ ask your doctor how you can receive this medication for a little a 10 per month “ Then they give the doctor some coupon card to help push the medication and the next thing you know the patient is soon paying 100 a month when the coupon expires Personally I wish there wa a rule in regard to new and expensive medication to advertise that it may require additional paperwork from the doctor for the insurance company to pay for it not to mention time to order it One of the most irritating thing wa frequently having to deal with a brand new and expensive medication sent over by a doctor most likely getting paid to give it out only to have to fill out prior authorization for the insurance company that the doctor would take more than a week to do and then having to special order the medication And after all of that with the patient calling more and more irate every day ending up with a 50 co pay that they didn ’ t want to pay in the first place The whole system is incredibly flawed
Lorraine Seglayen	Wow Something GOOD coming out of the Trump administration
cannaseven	How is this not a thing all ready
Regular Logic	Can t wait to see how the NPCs manage to skew this into an anti trump opportunity
Hank	coma or death a these may become permanent Ya don t say
matt Heffernan	Let s talk about better help Oh wait
baggins1	Advertising pharma is an abomination
Silverrida	I think the requirement to be transparent with drug price is an essential step in a free market medicinal system but I suspect it will not fix the more prominent issue related to drug pricing While I can laud trying to make the best out of the free market medicine simply doe not function by free market rule due to inelastic demand It is far easier to sell product at outrageous price when your consumer can not choose to not by them So while this is a good step in the current system there is a good chance that it will perpetuate the current system which is generally damaging
tenou213	The more salient point would be the government finally being leveraged a a negotiating body on behalf of all medical beneficiary to push down price Really should have happened decade ago but now we have a multi billion dollar industry to cut down to size
PikaBlu22	Wait what I know Canada is basically all US television but if we don ’ t allow direct to consumer prescription ad why are they legally allowed to be aired in Canada Is that law exempt if it come from a country that it isn ’ t illegal That just make no damn sense I absolutely despise these ad and want them banned
NeoDaVinci 97	I think there will be a mix Some of the company will budge others won t at all on their price Some may even raise them further a an extra F you
Terri Z	There is nothing about Trump that I like or admire But if he could manage to get the price of prescription down then I will do one hip hip hurrah for Trump one with my inside voice
David Mustaine	I guess we ll need some BetterHelp
Jamie Hitt	For most 45 of prescription could be eliminated by adopting a ketogenic diet
Thrifty Freebies	Perhaps include the lowest price a patient would pay and the maximum they ’ d pay
Max Purcell	Wow I ’ m so pro trump rn
GhosT	“ Coma or death a these may become permanent ” that wa beautiful I swear 😂😂
Rijacki Ledum	Requiring the drug company to show their mrp even though that s not the price a consumer with insurance pay would indeed show how out of whack the drug price are It is the price the drug company want for the medication either from an individual and or insurance It s a step toward transparency It s surprising though that anyone in this current administration would actually be advocating it
ScarletLunacy_Trinityk7s	Wow Trump actually did something good This is great for consumer but then again the Pharma company will fight back For their Rights Really it for the the Big Bucks they are earning What a bunch corporate Shills
Katiebugs !	this might be the first move i ve actually agreed on especially in regard to offering off brand alternative a someone who take multiple medication to be able to function it get pricey even with insurance i honestly thought when i clicked on this video i would get angry because of it being something that would make prescription even harder to get Also drug commercial need to stop with the light and happy tone they have and just be upfront about everything in general when i m thinking about if a constipation med might be right for me i want fact not fluff
Random frog	too little too late
YamiAlex224	If they want to put the price of the drug they should put the price everywhere at ALL TIMES not just TV Put it on website social medium ALL OVER Also common sense state CALL your insurance before any medication is needed
RileySRies	At least we are going in the right direction of trying to lower the cost of health care rather than just forcing everyone to pay more to even out the high cost
bronsonftorres	First time I ve been so pleasantly surprised by the Trump Administration
deeredude24	Love this format
joope125	3 20 List price start at 44 mo but check our website to see if your insurance cover some or all of the cost OH WOW SO DIFFICULT HOW WILL PHARMA EVER RECOVER
GeneralBlackjack	Problem is le people watch TV so the proposed regulation could be ineffective Just my two cent
godonlyknows13	wtf with the ad that said death could become permanent lol Like ya death is probably permanent
Your Best Katie Friend of All Time	I think one of the main reason why the drug company are fighting so much is exactly because it creates the possibility that consumer will begin to compare price more easily leading the company to have to lower the price to compete So I m excited to see this go through Got ta say though this is definitely a surprise that it s even being considered right now
Molly Jacobs	I work at a pharmaceutical advertising agency Pharma company will certainly comply if this becomes law but I m not sure it would decrease the price of prescription The people that make the ad don t choose the price Some company do offer program to save consumer money already and even that is hard to accomplish Besides the majority of prescription medication don t spend their advertising budget on TV ad it go to promoting to healthcare provider directly
TheCreepypro	if this end up dropping price of medicine that is good but that remains to be seen frankly I m glad that the government is stepping in at all cause this is long overdue
SinTanity	I really really can t believe I m saying this but Provided the administration doesn t pull some weird backwards move on this this is a really good idea Fuck drug company fighting to keep their customer drugged up and in the dark More transparency
Luke Van Gheem	I wonder if and how the NAFTA 2 0 figure into it by not allowing Canada to have generic for 2 more year I think the US drug patent law are a huge reason why US drug are so expensive
Kaven Vaillancourt	My guess is the company will do what every company doe and they will do My drug is stating at 36 99 and when you see the doctor the price is not the same because the amount is different of what is advertise
John Marez	I support it
snow4 summer	That law professor from all the information that feel just displayed sound like she ha no idea what s going on because simply the drug company not wanting this to happen say that they re afraid to show their price because then you ll have to lower it If they weren t afraid of that then they wouldn t have a problem with it And I think they believe it ll work with competitiveness instead of hurting company allowing other company to pop up and be better because if everyone ha to display their price of course first they re just going to split the price but eventually they re going to start using the price against each other meaning that their main talking point could be 20 lower than the leading brand And the thing about insurance is misleading because still a huge chunk of Americans don t have insurance so shouldn t they know how much they re going to spend I think any thing that help the consumer make a more informed decision is a benefit And it helping company is great like when the whole GMO Fiasco went down and made a whole new market for non GMO Foods opening up for more people to get into it I m hoping that this law get passed and it doe the same thing
Meloette	I really really do hate Trump but I have to give him credit where it s due Maybe I should give him a chance
Genuine Jess	Honestly I m surprised Trump is doing anything to help the average man If you consider the fact that he s never struggle for money and doesn t really know what it s like to be a normal human being I m a bit surprised I think it s a good idea because it at least give someone something to discus with their doctor and then they can ask themselves if there s a cheaper version out there when they talk to their doctor about it
Jessie Braun	I think this is a great idea and I hope that something positive come of it
C	I can t stand stupid nor manipulation To use the First Amendment to continue their unethical practice is disgraceful The first amendment is to protect the citizen right to free speech While on the other hand the Fifth Amendment Grant s people the right to not incriminate themselves and to stay silent The dip s doesn t even understand the Constitution I am also sick and tired of freedom of speech being misused Speech is a way to express word verbally normally but sign language a well Burning the flag is a form of nonverbal communication but is not the same equivalent to speech Just a with these Pharma and other lobbyist they are not citizen they are a company The job is to protect the worker and the consumer not the company Companies need to be held responsible for their choice and their action and for proper study to ensure it is not going to bring harm on to the innocent individual that have a association with that particular company They also need to stop giving warning to company when they re going to come audit and check out the health standard of these company so that they do not have time to cover up any safety concern This need to happen by a third independent party that can not be paid off and that get audited themselves
ryudragon7	I never thought I d say this about a Trump policy but I like the sound of this I seriously would like if drug company would advertise their price so there can be competition
iamweard	Forcing drug company to show pricing on their commercial is a great option Drug price should be shown regardless of where a prescription is advertised If that doesn t lower price then regulator can push further into measure to lower price transparency is a great start
Evie Henry	Old Philly D Dropping me a notification while I m asleep so I get a lovely message in the morning are you
Jack h	Philip DeFranco is distracting all of you
AmericanTeenagers	This is a good step I guess It seems like a band aid huge prescription industry problem and need for better healthcare
Christian Slack	Television is an aging and almost obsolete medium Require the price in streaming advertisement a well If they complain about how insurance can make it cheaper Well that might provide the incentive some people need to actually consider trying the drug It may be cheaper than they realize So it s a double edged sword of an argument Nobody not even the most brainwashed trump hater can deny this is great policy
noni_mus	I m just wondering if there s something more to this with the fact that they re only pushing for television ad and not website so we ll see if that get addressed later on
sara	suck for blind people hopefully they can use the descriptive service to hear the price
Thomas Anderson	Love the difference in editing make the story more fluid and dynamic in how it flow though can t imagine the strain it would put on whoever s editing Only thing I would say I missed seeing Phil haha There were point where picture were being out up such a with the picture of the Supreme court that felt unnecessary I think there a cut to Phil would work well Great work though
keriezy	Do I like a proposal by the current administration Oh my hell halth frozen over
chunlin05	ＯＲＡＮＧＥ ＭＡＮ ＢＡＤ ！！
Loryn McCaughan	This is interesting As a user of prescription on the daily I would be incredibly happy to be able to get them at a cheaper rate With 70 of American s using prescription it make no sense at all for price to continue to rise Transparency from the company on pricing would lead to lower price for consumer I hope and would make medication more affordable
Wendy Lott	Their argument that this would violate the 1st amendment is absolute shit They got their widdle fifi s all hurt cause now they re being called out for the greedy p o s they actually are To be honest I don t think this is strict enough I personally wish that the government would fully regulate the pharmaceutical industry I take a prescription that without insurance is 300 A MONTH That should be considered extortion Not only that but it should also be willful endangerment because that monthly medication is what I need to help me breathe And if I don t have it well you guy can do the math And this blood money industry know that and knowingly hyper charge because sick people like me have to have medicine just to live So I m all for this I personally think this is a great thing Furthermore I think that not only should they show the full price but also list any and all generic brand of a medication and list those price too Also go beyond t v and make this be for any and every advertisement they do regardless of the format I m really shocked that this is coming from the Trump administration but I really hope to see more thing like this from them
SunnyChi	As someone who take many medication and family doe too I think the only way they could pull this off is advertise the base cost of the prescription and make a note that their website ha more detail depending on your insurance But even then no one pay close attention to those commercial anyway plus I use the GoodRX not sponsored app that tell me what pharmacy is cheaper lol This is going to be very exciting to see where this is going
Allyson Jones	I think this is a good idea And I m sure company could also add approximate amount it could be with insurance in the commercial a well if they really wanted to I take prescription medication and insurance doe make a difference for sure No I don t have 5 000 medication But it cost 160 full price and I only pay 5 with my insurance
CJClarkMusic	I like this Why WOULDNT one want more information
LiquidSoulfly	A come or death could become permanent How am I supposed to call a medical provider when I am dead
BlackFox	Demonetized
JennifeRx	Hahaha people are going to freak out when they find out how much some of these drug cost These brand name drug if you have no coverage are outrageous
SirKibbleThe3rd	If this apparently violates the 1st amendment according to PhRMA Then store like Wal mart Target K mart etc have been breaking the 1st amendment for decade by showing how much it would cost to buy food and running ad showing how low their price are compared to their competition
upoverandgone95	Honestly not the healthcare reform Id most like to see but eh minor win
Damien Dziuk	coma or death a these may become permanent Who would of guessed that death is permanent
stollo770	God damn Drumpf trying to ruin America by making perception drug cheaper He work for the rich
Damien	So 70 of people need a prescription I doubt it that s just the pharma industry trying to squeeze more money out of you I wonder how people survived in the dark age without all of these marvelous pill
OJJL	Calling for first amendment right in this situation is absolutely ridiculous Same a people who cry about how they are denied freedom of speech and in the same breath scream bloody murder if anyone dare disagree with them or use their own right to freedom of speech
EmJeClFr	I think it would be fair to say if you can t follow the rule no ad will be displayed that violate it Then maybe add a fine That way it get their attention I feel bad for you guy in the US Hopefully thing get better or soon you will be in a dystopia
Anouk	Soo happy I live in the netherlands 😅 your healthcare system is fucked up
Madison Waycaster	Wait Trump is doing something good I just woke up am I in the twilight zone
Kristen Sherrill	Love the extra video
Luvcatz88	Idk it sound very confusing With the insurance I have now I either have no copay for my medication or it s a dollar so I guess I m not really effected
ThatGuyScott	Trump making America Great yet again Vote Red
Sixth Element Studios	Just so you know This video did not show up for me even in my subscription list until 10 22 CST and I m seeing comment from hour before hand Also never got notified Mostly I assume because after several refreshes it finally showed up out of the blue so it wasn t even cued till then Just some food for thought
sarahwithstars	Or you could just not be a moron Don t buy pharmaceutical you see on TV Buy a medication in the cheapest form at your doctor s recommended dose not a specific drug product at your doctor s specified dose UNLESS you have particular excipient ingredient allergy and need to avoid certain additive bulking agent colourants and gelatin found in particular drug delivery system
Jack Redmond	Haha just move to the UK
talaneobernardo	As for transparency I m all for but haggling with company for lower price what ever happened to the free market Literally billion of dollar are put into making a molecule into a working drug the drug is only profitable whilst it is covered by a patent the high price of a drug often reflects how much it took to manufacture it from pre formulation formulation all four stage of clinical trial etc even after all that trouble a drug might not even make it to market Lowering it price can lead to lower money in the pharma industry which in turn lead to fewer innovation
Lori H.	I don t think this will change anything a a parent of a T1D I know all too well how expensive prescription can be unless the govt regulates the health care system a a whole the price of health care and prescription won t change The pharmaceutic company the food industry and the government all work together to ensure they profit the health care and pharmaceutical company doesn t care about anything but profit And insurance doesn t do much to help the cost either most time in my experience you can purchase supply cheaper on your own without insurance
Benjamin Dupee	What are insurance company saying
Raechel	BUT If the company don ’ t have to say the price in the commercial they only age to type it into a screen that still put blind people in the same boat that everyone else wa in
PJ Irwin	It s all just political strategy not a coincidence that the midterm are le than a month away and the white house release one of their only proposal that s favorable to pretty much everyone except big pharma As with many of these politically charged policy decision I think it s a good thing if it actually lead to actionable change but it s also important to understand the motivation and timing for move like this I think it s quite likely to quietly disappear after the midterm though
Gringo Malone	Okay you go to the dr and you don t see the doctor anymore You see the half price assistant but pay still pay full price You go tot he pharmacy if you re lucky there is a generic brand so do you think anyone pay more for the name brand if they can save a few buck on a cheaper version So yes the big pharma company are fighting it because they won t be able to nail you at the register anymore and they will have to advertise their blatant gouging which will lead to big pharma pricing war
Kurisu Senpai	If the new rule won ’ t apply to the internet it ’ s useless
Fabián Riquelme	Goddamned permadeath
K4nler	So even more mod and cheaper Oh yeah WAIT i live in germany okay america do what´cha want
Scott Dilworth	I am fucking mesmerized this is the first time president Trump ha surprised me in a long long time
InfamousGaming	who ever edited this video great job i noticed a difference
Ashley P	LITERALLY the first positive thing I ve heard about what Trump is doing lol Do I think it will make them drop heir price No but still a good step forward
Jordin Pagel	Wonder how the medium will spin this a Trump being racist
Sean Eik	We can help you For money is a horrible thing for company that are being tasked with saving life
theheartyaerie	I don ’ t think it will change price just look at epipen for example it ’ s public knowledge that it ’ s expensive I still have to pay 600 if I want name brand epipen Thank God for CVS discount and generic epinephrine auto injector
Abel Theo	I love the morning show idea maybe this one can be used for more lighter content at time or maybe be a base for some of the new content on Philly D
Cocoa Crow	I love getting a morning pd we get an in depth personal look at an interesting issue AND we still get to look forward to the regular coverage later today
Rachael Shockey	A former drug company executive pushing for this is interesting to me
Boerbok Man	Big pharma is absolute evil money sucking a hole who ’ d sooner take all your money than actually helping you
Ethel Wood	This doe seem strange coming from the Trump administration but it is just before the midterm election Proposing something doesn t mean it will happen
chase addison	My thought would be having an online resource similar to a Wikipedia form It could follow a simple outline 1 Shows the prescription brand us effect side effect and to “ ask your doctor for more information ” 2 A List health care plan that can cover the pharmaceutical or 2 B for example be able to input your insurance info eg policy almost all insurer underwriter have this or a similar program on their website for insurance broker to use 3 A sheet of the price compared to other brand name and their generic 4 External resource that are used to compile the wiki a well a report about the prescription testing and other information Another idea would also have similar product listed in 3 but this could be dangerous and should be a resource for doctor and not the general public This could lead to a second format for doctor and health care professional This is just a rough idea though
gonzostwin1	On Donald Trump for helping the American people once again I know he said I might get tired of waiting for man I sure I m never gon na get tired of winning if it help the American people
soupsnake	They should expand it to all advertisement or at least any video animated advertisement
Nikole L	It s like they think we are feeble minded Oh no the price is cheaper with my insurance then what I saw on TV What do I do Like one of the point wa to include price in the conversation with your doctor so wouldn t the doctor say something along the line of with basic insurance it will be more around this price or there s a cheaper alternative that will work for you It seems like the only people that have an issue with putting the price in the ad are the company behind said ad
Kaber Esplin	I hate to be that guy but are you going to make a video about better help
ClutchUpCody	No We need fewer drug and we need the government to leave the American market alone This is not capitalism Let the free market provide a legitimate fix to this horrible drug problem in our great country More government is not the answer le is
Gwen	Why do we even have prescription drug commercial
PunchProd	I m in favor of drug price being reduced but the biggest argument a to why they re so dang high is that research to create them is expensive I think that a better approach would be banning ad and finding government funding or aid to drug company to develop new med Just my two cent No offense to patient but Dr s and specifically pharmacist are going to know more about drug than they consumer will ever get out of a commercial and each drug ha guideline for it s use It s not something you should just pick without justified research data for your condition
Fiasco	Socialized healthcare is the long term answer that s where we re headed anyways we ll just be 50 year behind rest of the modernized country
Mewly	1 09 Coma or death a these may be permanent Well shit there go my hope of having temporary death
MercuryDjinn3	1 08 Coma or death These may become permanent
Bob Marlin	It s just dumb to have commercial for prescription medication in the first place When I go to the doctor shouldn t they know what I need
Voice Number 18	Phil I m Canadian and we have those commercial a well
Danielle E.	It s a step in the right direction
Scott Doherty	Yeah you guy need to fix your drug ad
Adam Savage	The trump administration You will hate it 90 of the time then all of a sudden it whip out a legitimately good policy proposition and a balanced and fair opinion that leaf everyone confused and suspicious
WHEELZ	and people say he nothing but evil
Tom Odayama	I have no knowledge about the political side of thing but on a moral stand point you shouldn ’ t have to spend an arm and a leg for drug that can potentially save your life
Erin Ashley	I think it would be great to see the price on the ad People who aren t on medication don t realize just how expensive prescription can be I take four different medication I get all of them in a generic form They are still about 200 300 a piece per month Except for my birth control it s 250 for a 3 month supply it s crazy how much pharmaceutical company s charge I m sure it doesn t cost them anywhere near that amount to make the product
Reding	Death As they may be permanent What did I miss Is there a form of death that s not permanent o O
elementwind91	Frankly I m very surprised that the president is trying to make this into law but while this is a step in a good direction I feel like this still isn t quite the solution Idealistically I feel that medicine should not be a business
Sandy When	I make me frustrated that these phara company have enough money to make longer and better ad As much a I enjoy seeing happy people frolic in house and yard that I can never afford they can start investing into a better marketing team If they re so uptight about what to put on their ad then it really show what their true motif are
asdasddd asdads	Coma or death a these may be permanent Oh my god thank you I thought id go to heaven and get sent back via EdenExpress
MrHRY	And here I wa thinking Trump made it harder for all the crazy Americans to fu k their life up with unnecessary consumption of legal drug But naw
Ashlee Todd	How about we just make medication affordable Crazy Concept
ZeldaMusic113	I think this is a step in the right direction Transparency may not make pharmaceutical company lower their price but maybe that will be the next step after this get signed into law I have multiple prescription for my chronic migraine one of which I had to fight with my for insurance company 3 month to cover It s a single use nose spray medication that is 500 per spray container and there s no generic There is no reason for pharmaceutical company to keep hiking up price It hinders the consumer s ability to access medication that could be life saving or greatly improve quality of life
Serenity Forschen	While those item may work but honestly it s not going to really get to the underlying issue We need to do what other country do and nationally negotiate price and ban advertising
Reanne Strauss	As a state certified pharmacy technician who deal with uninsured patient day in and day out it would be amazing for them to know the cost of a medicine before they come up to my counter 90 of the time if the drug cost more than 50 for a 30 day supply patient will go without the drug that could improve their life If they know upfront what the cost is they can have better and more educated talk with their doctor about therapeutic alternative that cost le What seems to happen very commonly is that they go to the doctor get the prescription come to the pharmacy and then leave without their expensive medication and never follow up with the doctor after It ’ s crazy how this system work to make more and more money for big pharma than actually get a living breathing human being what they need to live a healthy life But that ’ s just my opinion a someone who deal with issue like this every single day 🤷🏼‍♀️
ExaltedDuck	Pharmaceutical advertising I m sure the swelling cost ha a lot more to do with the inclusion of prescription coverage in medical insurance Much like how college would cost much le if not for federally backed student loan which are immune from bankruptcy discharge
Braverocker	Welcome to 1920 America greatings from EU
Dominique Noel	Feels like the discussion they should be having is why are people so much medicated nowadays We are consuming an unhealthy level of medicine But of course the industry isn ’ t about to tell u that cause they make so much money out of it
Cody Whalen	Im anti trump but I do respect the move a lot of problem surrounding drug are because of lack of transparency that s why some people demonize something like cannabis but take Oxy that they think they need but not surprise the trump administration is taking a stab at big pharma since they traditionally support the left more hurt them hurt their backer
LET'S TALK	Advertising prescription medication to the public should be illegal And it should be mandatory for medical professional to advise alternative companion treatment method in the case of condition that are self inflicted reversible For instance a healthier lifestyle
Mollecules75	Lets just see where this take u It s a good move however I m not sure it will do what we think it will do hoping in Colorado
Luisa Guzmán	I don t think this would work but if it doe it won t have a major effect on the price You know what would Prohibiting advertisement of drug That take up a whole lot of the company s expense and make them put a higher price on their product Especially the fact that they spend a whole lot of money persuading doctor and giving them free trip and thing for them to recommend and prescribe the drug to the patient Who end up paying for that The consumer who pay higher price It s also clearly not ethical or fair doctor shouldn t accept it but there are always some who will
Khazar Hayat	I guess I ll just die than
Chava Yang	Yay Morning show
JTR	I am not a big fan of the Trump administration but this is a step in the right direction I would go further than this such a establishing a price ceiling but I will give them credit for this if it go through
Jackluck2	Good on the Trump admin for the right step forward
mrs. whales	It would be weird to hear or see price in commercial a you never see price anywhere else
Naeem Ahmad	new intro
Xicor Warface	I see you there with that improved editing style quality 😏👌
glampizational	The comment about how showing drug price on commercial would decrease the likelihood of the patient seeking out a medication that they need is just not reasonable Patients receive expensive medication all the time without seeing an ad for the product For some the patented brand only product are genuinely being the best option for them and for others drug company are legally allowed to incentivize provider to prescribe their product The best way to ensure that a patient won ’ t get something that they need is to prescribe something that they can ’ t afford
Charles Badger	Personally this is a good step do I like that the government is not necessarily I think in the free market the government should set guideline or requirement to help the free market and nothing more This seems like a good step in that direction I think that posting a pharmacy price of a drug before purchase is a positive for the consumer and will drive cost down However I think this should also be done for hospital and doctor Prices of their service and such should be posted in such a way that the consumer can shop between hospital and doctor This will also drive down cost with hospital and doctor I get that health insurance company have deal and such with drug company hospital and doctor And those price should be shown per health insurance agency if they are different from regular expected price so that the price difference can be seen Ideally then this could or would help those already having deal with insurance company or help those who provide just a good a service a anyone else for a cheaper price
Cody Choules	Well nice job if this go through This is a big win for this administration
Amarat	Why am I watching this I ’ m not even American
Rina Thomson	Phil this is so crazy creepy My family wa literally talking about Pharmaceutical company and there advertising last night how scandalous it is We werent talking about the price thing didnt even know about that but it crazy thats what your morning show is about But i compleatly agree that the price should be listed and i think it should be listed on all add not just T V add
Sarah Ro	It ’ s so weird to me that they can advertise prescription drug like shouldn ’ t the doctor be the one suggesting medication not the patient 🤔
Wonko42	I m torn on this I think transparency is great but pharma doe have a point about the confusion Health insurance is confusing especially for the uninitiated or the elderly but I am also not fan of drug company I ve seen how they jack up price on life saving med before their patent run out I also worked in a doctor s office and have seen how they incentivize doctor to prescribe drug It feel so dirty to me I don t know what the answer is but all of this just seemd to be symptom of the underlying issue Our healthcare system is broken I find it frustrating and infuriating
Abraham Castillo	I like these short single video it like taking a small bite out of a cake easy to digest Instead of trying to eat the whole thing
Butters Scotch	Title make it sound like rx patient are gon na get screwed so they scramble to watch PDS Sucks especially the thumbnail
LoyalMatter	I actually agree with the current administration Wait what It would interesting to see if this streamlines cost for expensive prescription drug but it maybe the fast spoken fine print portion of an ad I can see all the pharmaceutical company lobbyist coming together to try to stop this from coming about They ve got a good thing going but it is why insurance is so darn confusing
Gemnox MC	If you re not lying about your product then you re not committing fraud It isn t a violation of the consumer s right
Gerry Straatsma	Wow I actually agree with the trump admin on this one never thought i would say that
KuzKiller887	Next force bar and restaurant to disclose the price of alcoholic beverage I ’ m sick of going to the bar ordering two beer and getting a bill for 23 It ’ s a blatant way to rip you off If i knew the price ahead of time i would order something else
Brandon Lee Sanders	I come to realize Trump is not the evil person the medium say he is Its policy like this that is proving it As crazy a it sound I might actually vote for him in 2020 If you attack me for my personal opinion you re only pushing me further away from liberalism For the first time I m open minded and willing to listen to people with differing opinion than my own
justinfs	I can see the intent here of the addition of price In a text format however I feel like it will be more fine print which is already in these ad people don t read This need to be said allowed in the add in my point of view
MRICECOLDCOLE	We have these ad in canada
Hailey	When I first heard the 70 of the population having prescription I wa like no way then I realized I do take prescription birthcontrol my best friend ha a prescription for migraine etc Yikes
Danni Is Tired	Im worried that if they lower their price they ll use le effective ingredient chemical medication
FellNerd	The medical industry would become affordable if company had to list price
MalefaxTheBlack	As someone who s on several prescription including one that s keeping me alive I can approve of this news Especially a my prescription keep being changed Maybe this will help me avoid a nasty surprise to my wallet in the future a ha happened in the past
Cass Thompson	Drugs capital D Drugs up until 2 year ago i would take Tylenol pm maybe 2 time a year I wa then diagnosed with a rare disease and take 6 different drug every day now With insurance it a manageable 200ish dollar a month However one wa not covered by my insurance and the doctor worked very hard to find a program solution to get me it after month of not being able to get it I told my DR if I need it that badly ill just pay for it out of pocket he laughed sadly and said no no I would not pay for it out of pocket ever long story short he told my it cost 40 000 dollar for 1 ml injection I need 1 ml injection every 3 day turn out the only way to get it is through the manufacture program were they will give it to you free and use it a a loss come tax season and basically remove million of dollar from there tax what a scam
Jason DeLong	Death may become permanent 😂
Joseph Castillo	Whoa whoa WHOA Death can be permanent
Cristiane Williams	The only way to get drug company to lower price is to effect their bottom line The EU ha effectively dissuaded company from breaking there term by charging them large fine per day I personally think direct to consumer ad when it come to American drug company is ridiculously evil
BandidoTheVillain	I haven t watched this video yet but I can already tell this will piss me off
Prady	This is a great move Regardless of whether it actually lower price or not at least the consumer is AWARE of what the price is Transparency is usually a good thing It also wouldn t stop the doctor from actually prescribing a medication that a patient NEEDS This seems like a positive in all front for the customer
Connor Anderson	Trump is the smartest man I ve ever seen so I m sure it will reduce price
Ryan Chatta-G	Loving the morning show
Stephanie Walczak	TV I don t even know how to find a way to watch a TV anymore 😆
lovecraft5878	If the drug company don t like it they don t need to advertise on TV
Der Giggler	I like this format
Grigori Echegaray	I am excited for the morning show but I m also shocked the pharmaceutical company are getting hit this hard to put it frankly Since I wa a child who had a doctor who worked with the company to directly get paid for every person on the medication I never paid a dime because of the service my family wa involved with but then how much of the money they got from those service were not necessary I ended up more damaged from the dependency on those medication then I am suffering not having them in my life anymore
n0nTox!c	Yeah I get prescribed drug no matter the price I quit some anti depressant once because I noticed they cost over a 1000 dollar a bottle and that s 5 time more than my monthly income If my insurance got killed I d be screwed Not to mention it wa one of those that are very dangerous to just quit So I quit before it became very dangerous and requested something more affordable if the sh t hit the fan But all the anti depressant I ve been on seem to make the depression worse to the point of becoming suicidal so I wish they would just legalize weed already Helps instantly and doesn t lead to suicidal thought Sure it can lead to guilty thought about stuff I ve done wrong But I think that s good I don t always see that I ve been an as at time Weed allows me the clarity to realize when I m being stupid Anti depressant seem to veil my stupidity from me and encourages it to run rampant Causing all sort of mayhem and worst of all Mayhem I don t remember
Nipuna55	Pharmaceutical company have a lot of power over politician so well see what happens
Duckman1616	I m extremely surprised this is coming out of the Trump administration but I think it s a great idea nonetheless Giving consumer more information about a product should never be seen a a bad thing
Inflexi	I think they should have to post the price part of the reason healthcare in this country is so expensive is because it all done behind closed door with price you ll never see No competition Force them to say how much it cost
Thomas the chancey	Never took any prescription drug
Mephistophelolz	Not just the US and New Zealand we get these type of drug advert in Canada too
Juan Cruz	Good Morning Phil nice to see you 😁
will collier	Wouldn ’ t it be better to outlaw drug ad all together If there ’ s something wrong with you I think your doctor would know what ’ s best not some wholesome tv ad
zilean timeciper	Hi Philip youtube broke again on mobile phone the app won t play video it just play the audio with a black screen have you seen this or is anyone else having this problem
SangoProductions213	Probably not a good a just removing drug ad period but I definitely think this is a step in the right direction
Andrew Cleary	Coma or death a these may become permanent
94JAVS	Dude of course we love having this morning extra video Keep it up
Akusushi	I love these morning short but sweet vids
Matthew	Woah this could be a game changer and I m someone who normally hate regulation This is something that wouldn t hurt drug company or consumer like banning them from advertising completely would It would definitely lower price due to competition Also their excuse is pretty lame because the average consumer is smart enough to know it will probably be cheaper for them if they have insurance
cZair Kolmoslink	I think it be good
Stephen Albright	This is MAGA
Yasha TDP	oh finally trump ’ s presidency may be doing something right
Mark Cameron	Goddamn I love being Canadian
James B	Just another encroachment on the right of corporation and individual America is on a slippery slope to socialized medicine a enjoyed in bankrupt third world nation of Western Europe Taiwan and Canada to name a few Socialism doesn ’ t work Venezuela is a prime example Only absolute free market capitalism work a seen in Somalia
Kevin Herbert	Loved having an extra video
30Chompi	Judging from past practice I d say this is not going to happen the way it is being talked about currently Either some washed up version of it will happen or not at all Don t get too excited about promise happening before mid term election and remember Trump change his mind a lot
Gooniegoogle	Wow Trumps doing something amazing
Just another ghost	Coma or death a these may become permanent yea no shit
Josh Fritz	This seems like a good idea to put pricing in the commercial It help people window shop for the pharmaceutical they want at the price they can afford If they ’ re only referred to one drug without being told the price of prescription they might not know if there are other option that could be cheaper Personally I would want to be able to see the price so I can at least weigh my option a little bit before making a final decision Also making company put price in commercial isn ’ t freedom of speech infringement All it ’ s doing is making it more convenient for the consumer to make a better decision about which drug they want
Erik C 'Piano Man'	Trump doe a lot of thing wrong but promoting more transparency with big pharma isn ’ t one of them I don ’ t get to say this often but “ Go Trump ”
rageface studios	1 07 death can become permanent I never knew that
Giovanna Greeff	I m happy about this but it feel like perfect timing to try and win in the midterm It s a proposal right now and I can totally dee them dropping it after November 6th
yolodolo	better help scammer
bjarked47	Side effect death may become permanent you what mate
Orgspasm	BASED TRUMP continues to serve the WORKING CLASS
GloriousMane	The thing is if this go through with repubs in charge we have to be incredibly careful of this It sound good but who can possibly trust traitor at this point Notice how they say negotiate price not lower price with repubs in charge they d probably make the drug cost more because that way they can hurt people more effectively These are the same people who try to take away your insurance entirely don t trust them for a second
Abbreviated Reviews	1 08 Permanent death is the worst
thescrybe	Please contact your doctor if you experience any of these side effect dizziness coma or Death As these may become permanent Don t get no more permanent than death SMH
snika123	i dont even live in america but it nice to see a government actually helping the people not company for a change the australian government just seem to be chasing money from big company
eljoel89	Wouldn t it be nice if we had Medicare for All That way everyone pay the same negotiated price and pharmaceutical company can advertise an accurate price for consumer Or we could just do what every other damn country in the world doe and ban them from advertising directly
Invernessmagic	Y all Americans and cray NHS4LIFE
Cajun Kev	I know this first hand I have a severe back injury which I take pain med for but also had to start taking medicine for anxiety because I wa having trouble sleeping Doctor wrote me a prescription for my anxiety and found out at the pharmacy it wa over 500 for 30 pill Thank God they called my doctor and he wrote me a prescription again but this time there wa a generic which only cost me four buck a month My Doctor ha told me in the past that he wa even disgusted by the high price of prescription drug and the trick the pharmaceutical use the keep generic out of market
Bishop M	I just noticed there s a lot more editing than normal unless I m missing something I like it
William Mild	You said that the administration is seeking comment for the next 60 day Where can we go to comment on this
George Vieira	This seems more like a White House PR stunt than actually implementing something that would help people with the rising cost of prescription
Ice Uchiha	I am usually opposed to trump but this go to show that nothing is black or white I agree with the movement wholeheartedly
kyuven	This is an interesting one On the one hand it s something It s something with at least a modicum of good intention behind it Any kind of something that move u forward is a good thing But it seems like not even a bandaid It s like a tissue or shirt on the wound until you get a bandaid Moreover it s treating a wound we only have because of stupidity
Lover of the Knowins	Only reason all these drug are needed because there are no regulation on childbirth Retards breed pill are needed 70 on drug 70 should not breed Problem solved
Emster234	I m not surprised Trump said he wa gon na make health care actually affordable Bam
RE RE	I like the am snippet You should make a news app people Can download for free on their phone and post news alert and update along with video I would heavily be into that
TheMusicmaxxx	Im so surprised that theyre doing this I thought this administration would listen to lobbyist
Mr. Mr.	when you literally just found out your insurance benefit after paying for them for three year with no intention of actually going to the doctor or therapist but you ’ ve had suicidal thought and the complete inability to do anything productive for the past three month And you ’ ve been working out meditating and eating healthier and you kind of don ’ t know what to do because your brain is a cesspool of constant horrific defeating negativity 18 7 despite taking all those measure
John Vest	Wooooooooo more Philly D
Sheldon Barfield	In general transparency is good for keeping market honest and competitive Going through insurance company obscures the true cost price of what you re getting making it harder to compare and shop around for a better deal
Clarissa Gafoor	What an excellent idea
Jahanzeb Khalid	Loved the editing style and new graphic Would love to see more like this
horrorkesh	I would think it would easier and cheaper just to change price on a website then redo a TV ad if something change
Mikael Bergström	Living in Sweden this whole commercial for pharmaceutical aimed at consumer thing just baffle me Just seems like a big public health risk a people are generally medically ignorant and are likely to put pressure on their doctor and end up taking more medication and more expensive medication than they actually need The decision of what medication should be given to a patient should be the made by a medical professional
Mike DePung	This issue highlight the general plight of healthcare in the US When all is privatized the primary driving consideration is never the welfare of human being It s always the bottom line no matter how noble insurance company or pharmaceutical company try to make their ad and info sound We need a single payer system which is not making u a socialistic society It s making u a balanced freer society because healthcare cost enslave most of u Unless you are one of the wealthy elite you are one major illness away from bankruptcy and healthcare cost are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US Okay thanks Phil and team for continuing excellent analytical work
Mainfold	Damn if that pharma change pass is massive and so pro consumer it s amazing
Crash Zone	This should be supported by Democrats but I bet you anything they wont
Nannette Oswalt	Remove ability to advertise No problem with the question of price Price of drug go down with significantly lower advertising budget Win win
amillerinADKs	I would be very interested to see how the ad buy in different medium stack up What I see happening is those company simply buying more print and online ad and advertising on TV at off hour We wouldn t need this sort of half measure transparency if there wa a public health insurance option for ALL citizen because the consumer pool would be so large they could easily negotiate for far lower price a they do in every other developed nation
Andrea B	This is a fabulous idea whether or not it lead to lower price They should expand this rule to ALL drug advertising
ChrisssEZ	This is a perfect and informative 5 min video I like stuff like this
magnvss	In other word and just to be clear a this is not yet set nothing or very little just to save face will change and this is merely a move to extort under the table money from the big farmaceutical company under the guise of consumer benefit Older than the politics
Eddgarur	But but but orange man bad REEEEEEEEEEEE
Losha's Channel	Call your doctor if you experience death a this may become permanent Well they aren t lying
Tyler Harris	Good Screw drug company they ve been overcharging people for decade and getting away with it I hope they re backed into a corner and end up lowering price
irvinx1986	Why wa this video monetized
Zhanger37	Trump is actually doing something positive Oh wait he s old and ha ton of prescription that explains it
Maverick5588	Phil please please do a piece on massive insulin price causing diabetic people to die because they can not afford the drug Charles Best and Banting created the drug with the intention of it being free It is not free and after all these year people are dying from it
Vanessa Vasquez	Honestly these company claiming that this will violate their freedom of speech is untrue The free speech clause provides different level of protection depending on the type of speech If the speech is non commercial I e me giving my opinion then it receives full protection If the speech is commercial BUT it is both lawful and non misleading then it receives an intermediate level of protect If it is a commercial speech that is both or either unlawful and misleading then there is little to no protection These advertisement would automatically fall into commercial misleading speech If these company ever tried to bring this argument to court they would probably lose just saying
Tim Wilsin	Love the morning show They should have to list the price it common practice
Soli2de	Ok here s what i think might happen Given that the price disclosure seems to ONLY be for TV advertising i think it will just change drug manufacturer marketing dept n instead of seeing those ad so prevalent on TV we ll most likely see them more in the market like social medium online n what not where they DONT have to disclose those detail Because let s be honest they dont want to drop drug price it s all about exploiting those loophole they purposely leave in there to maximize profit Because let s be honest here the old TV market is slowly losing it s audience since most are shifting towards streaming and just the internet in general Soon individual youtubers will be sponsored by certain drug I mean we already have hims com marketing to youtubers it s only a matter of time
moose8710	I think I heard someone on Joe Rogan s show mention how unusual it is that we get prescription drug advert Glad this administration is doing something about it Really surprised too
Robbie Cale	No prescription fee for me
McHaven07	Doubt it will ever happen but I ll be pleasantly surprised if it doe
Jim Fortune	1 08 Death MAY become permanent
Ragoth T.	Dude this is so cool To actually know the listed price you would be able to ask your insurance company how much they would cover and then ask your doctor about cheaper alternative if there are any This is a seriously good thing what a surprise
SK8fourL1F3	Awesome Love the video
Thaddeus Beadle	I m going into pharmacy so this is helpful news
A House	We love our pill Did that commercial say something about permanent death
Oh No	Why on earth would you need prescription drug to be advertised in the first place Go to the doctor get diagnosed with whatever and let them decide on the appropriate medication Ridiculous
Kendall Cary	I think this is a wonderful idea a good start to transparency
seventhsinn	Trump 2020
hollenbeck to nowhere	Great morning video Thank you for the awesome video Congratulations on the Steamy award 🥇 As always your shirt really tie the room together 👍🏻💯
Matt Mulroy	you guy should make happy upbeat video to wake up to i didn ’ t like the test show because they were depressing to watch in the morning maybe a happy monetizable video on morning that the full show might be demonetized
chickensoufflet	Hey how about instead of this fight the drug company just aren t allowed to advertise anymore I have always thought that it s wrong Spend that money on research
Cameron Guilbeau	Love the morning uploads
Zach Amos	A morning show You spoil me
pajanaparty	I ’ m all for this new morning show But I refuse to watch it I ’ m not called a beautiful bastard at the beginning I ’ ll lose my identity otherwise
Cristian Barriga	Did people stop buying fast food after they were required to put up the amount of calorie in their product I don ’ t think people will stop buying these pharmaceutical product because price are too high but it ’ s good to show people what they might be getting into in term of pricing Information and transparency is important for consumer
Mr. Bones	These advertisement play in Canada too not sure how you missed that and jumped to New Zealand
Apex	No wonder they dont want marijuana to be legal They would loose billion
Branmuffin	70 of people have at least one prescription That ’ s too many especially considering that 90 of the time when we take a drug it ’ s just covering up a symptom instead of healing the underlying issue The allopathic medicine model is very flawed Anything to expose it shadiness seems like a good thing to me
a smol pupper	Unedited Footage of a Bear anyone
Robert Tromble	I think this is a good thing but this would not have an effect on most drug since it is usually only the new fancy medication that are advertised on tv Decreasing the length of pantents would have a bigger effect
aneesh	1 08 did she said coma or death
Jesus Rubalcava	Trump is best president 👌
hoskins225	Pharmacist here Disclosing price in ad will help for comparison sake but will also cause a lot of confusion I feel because the price of the drug isn ’ t the same everywhere Pharmacies sell different drug for different price Also just because drug A is cheaper than drug B doesn ’ t mean that drug A is cheaper once insurance is applied
plaid13	It is just a way for them to pretend they are trying to do something about the absurd cost of healthcare in this country In reality they have big pharma lining their pocket so they can keep the price high
solrinin	I m guessing this probably won t do shit for reducing prescription price and the current drug czar know that which is why he s going along with it because it ll be good optic It ll be just like how Trump got u out of NAFTA only to change it name and sign onto it again Granted that being the case it s a baby step in the right direction I guess
Ruben	Coma or death may become permanent
GothicDancer45	The excuse the drug company are using is so bull it hilarious People should know the base price and then factor in what their insurance might cover after knowing the price Not knowing the base price only hurt consumer
Logamn1023	MORNING SHOW
R Sorrells	I m pleasantly surprised by this one I wouldn t think Trump or anybody else in the government would consider something like this thats seam SO pro consumer
CadillacJak	MAGA
Mj Vision	What ’ s crazy to me is that a lot of people don ’ t know how much their medication cost Whenever I have to take a prescription drug I always ask for the price without insurance
OneFourFive	Or have no ad on drug As someone who life outside of the only two country that have tv ad for drug it seems so barbaric to me
Aosha / IceAokiji303	Contact your doctor if you re experiencing coma or death a these may become permanent did I hear that ad right
TheNexusLord	While I have always been a hardcore believer in Capitalism over the year and after working in the health care industry and seeing what go on there are situation where Pure Capitalism doesn t work Capitalism depends on a freedom of choice You DON T have that with healthcare People facing death pain and suffering or with loved one who are are not free to take it or leave it The health care industry may not have kidnapped an individual and threatened them with death and or torture But like a kidnapper making demand they have the ability to help or set free that kidnapped individual Capitalism doe not work when the buyer is under duress to pay a ransom You really aren t free to just take it or leave it 0
Omega Zapruder	A stopped clock is right twice a day This is a stopped clock moment for the Trump administration in my mind I definitely think that pricing information should be more readily available to consumer in advertisement just like side effect of medication I still despise this administration but I do like this
Senseless Nonsense	As a Libertarian I ’ m all for transparency However it ’ s a government solution to a government caused problem
Kaija Schmauss	The argument that people won t buy the drug they need if they know the price is such bullshit I ve never made any decision about my healthcare based on a drug commercial No one doe I listen to my doctor s advice a well a my mom s because she s an RN
Ezee Posse TV	I still find it crazy that you have to pay ton of money for medical hospital A E transport etc Where a here in Scotland it doesn t cost you a mortgage It s literally free kind of It s all paid for via tax If you need med for the rest of your life it don t cost you a penny You have an accident You get taken in Ambulance to hospital treated then released and you never see a shocking bill through your door Good ol NHS
Kuchi Kopi	This is good news to hear that more pressure is being put on Pharma company
Lilly Rey	This will never happen The problem is that the pharma doe not and will not put cap on how much they will charge for these medication That s what we need Not the retail cost because how medication are priced are differently whether or not you have insurance
Nova superb	i like Trump now 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷‍♀️
Craig Pringle	Hell yes I love the idea of a morning show Please do this more often🙏🏻
Marcelo	i like the morning show but the editing may be too much but hey thats just me
Butt is Holy	This is actually really good big step in the right direction
MissLilyputt	This will only cause pharmaceutical company to find way around the rule such a posting the price of a pill v the entire 30 supply so if you see that it say it ’ s 20 people will imply that it mean a month worth of pill cost that but could actually just be one pill They ’ ll claim there is an asterisk so people should be able to see that They can also flood ad with lot of number in an effort to confuse the consumer Pharmaceutical company are not known for their transparency or even have very honest rep I mean just look how many drug are used off label due to creative rep marketing for thing that they haven ’ t been proven to work on Sad
Sheepman Miley	Coma or death a these may become permanent lol wtf america
Petey Parker	Hello hello In a place called Vertigo
Phoenix Phalanges	Yet another thing Trump is helping to do to make America great again
kupaN9	coma or death a these may become permanent Wait Do they have a temporary death Have they cured death and not told u
Ayvee Vez	I dont have a Twitter to tweet you this story but please talk about Lauren M today It s almost a year to date to the shooting last year I dont understand why this keep happening But I know we need to keep shining a spotlight on it to hopefully get something ANYTHING done to prevent this But also to honor those killed http www ksl com article 46412209 suspected gunman found dead after u student slain on campus tuesday class canceled
PhxtoNash	I think Trump did good Just because you don t like him doesn t mean you have to hate everything he doe people give him a chance he is our president weather we voted for him or not
Phoenix King	Still don t see how people can hate on Trump he s doing more for u the last 3 president
Caroline reilly	so good news maybe
Dayguard	Never expected to get news about the Trump administration that I actually liked This is a good policy hope it go through Also keep doing these morning show kthx
Samus Aranon	Great video I also really like the text boxed bullet point on the video great job whomever is doing the editing
Neil Bonsteel	These advert should be required to show a montage of the side effect a they re listed
my dick is saying	Shilly D talking about prescription drug after he roped his fan on a mental health scam Oh the irony
Debra Blackburn	All these company have to do is list their non prescription price and have an asterisk stating price may very with prescription carrier My oldest take one of the drug advertised in this video with him being on Medicaid Medi Cal I don t have to pay for it BUT I know that isn t the case for everyone Everyone ha different insurance carry and it varies on the type you have
elfudge35	Yes I m shocked about the drug price transparency stuff and it is a good thing if it is actually enforced we ll see about that but no it will not cause company to lower price That s a guarantee
Kattunge	Set aside the fact that this might work or not A FORMER BIG PHARMA EXEC WENT AGAINST BIG PHARMA LOBBYING I AM AMAZED And also fear for his safety lol
mindlessenigma	First off I love seeing the morning show back again And a far a these potential new rule I think the transparency will be a good thing Everyone should be able to make an informed decision about every purchase they make
The Dro	Sounds to me like everyone ha ulterior motif
GFX Charkk	I think this is what a lot of people expected from Trump I want to see more of this
TheRedhead1997	I ’ m convinced big pharma is trying to kill u
gqfiend	Like
alyssa.does.life	I have a medication that I can t afford to take Its 60 000 a year I know this is on the low end of expensive medication Its ridiculous
Sebastian Smith	The cost of insulin ha increased 300 since 2003 and Azar is the one who did it It won t work because drug like insulin have no incentive to lower their price because there are other option but they aren t a good Transparency I think will help and the drug industry is fighting because they know it s bad for them It will better help people decide what pharmacy and policy to buy but they need to be regulated harder
Jay Ingram	Sort of random but I didn t so much like the graphic used in this video just a a bit of feedback The The Big Question and Things to Note bit looked a little off
Matthew Dopler	I am personally not surprised by this Trump did say in his State of the Union speech that he wanted to lower drug price
Alexandria Glumb	As someone who work in a diabetes clinic where patient frequently come in and tell u that they can ’ t afford the drug that their doctor are talking about or they have to choose between taking a prescription or their insulin And yes different insurance may cover different amount but it give patient a starting point to talk to their doctor and talk to their insurance company rather than having them go into the conversation totally blind So I think this would be great And I think they should have to put it in print ad too
Jose Perez II	So they will lobby congress and prevent this from passing If it doe pas they will just stop advertising on television
Ellina	It sound like the intention wa to get more people to buy drug
alex Barbosa	I m very surprised delighted this administration is pushing for something so consumer friendly
Uhagin	Lower drug price would be fantastic but it would already be a win if consumer had full transparency of the price of a drug before asking their doctor to prescribe it Many would probably think twice if they really need it if they knew in advance how expensive the particular drug is
John Eusebio	This seems like a good idea It isn t perfect but it seems like a good step in the right direction As for the pharma company argument that the price will deter customer just add in Costs XX xx before insurance deduction There Uphold the law while making it clear to people that they ll probably be paying below sticker if their insurance cover it
My Name	So why should I care about this Its time for the US to get medicare for all like every other developed country in the world That would be something I would care about
It’s Dat	I love getting a new show in the morning
enginesnblades	This is a giant nothingburger The elephant in the room is our absurd healthcare system Forget tv ad let s make move to catch up to the 20th century Yeah I know we re in the 21st but this is America baby step
EyeHeartThePanda	transparency is a good thing here I think anyway
Steve Texas	Pharmacies should report all info on any advertising they make Should also require showing alternative to their drug on the advertisement that will help them be more aggressive on pricing their drug Health should not be treated like buying cell phone it need transparency it could be life or death and yeah these pharmacy are asking redonculous price for drug and it ain ’ t just to cover the cost to make and invent over it lifetime Also I can ’ t believe how much I get charged for my prescription and my friend get a way lower cost because the are in poverty level and get special pricing from the drug maker that sound a bit nut I pay 10 time more for my prescription and I work way way more hour probably resulting in y declining health Vicious circle
Mickey Williams	I feel disgusted with these “ make their own price ” company and really the whole “ take a pill to feel better ” culture we are cultivating in America Not to mention the side effect and or interaction with the other drug threat are taken even over the counter stuff can be dangerous I e new warning for Advil ibuprofen
PUBBY DO	1 07 Coma or death a these may become permanent Death Permanent Naaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww
Varsuuvius	I have to say good on the administration for pushing for this change Whether or not it affect price giving patient an idea of how much they need to pay is great Advertising medicine always felt scummy to me even growing up in the state Also the bullet point list in the video were great Not sure if I d want them in the normal PDS but great for the morning show
carneyaugustine420	Yooooo morning vids are awesome may I suggest pretend to drink coffee if it s a morning vid lol
Kirstyn	This is a great thing Transparency should be a top priority
Shaddosa	Now I know why there are nut case out there going on about pharma Because you weird bastard have allowed pharma company to advertise drug like adult candy
Gustas Jucaitis	LO HELLO
ActionGenesis	Trump is essentially trying to heal a broken bone with a band aid Jesus Christ
Nic Jimenez	I ve been a pharmacy technician for a couple of year now and I can t tell you how many time I ve seen people come to the pharmacy with a prescription for a really expensive drug just to change their mind after finding out the price I think that this is a good idea so the consumer know what they re getting prior to all of this hassle i e going to the doctor hospital pharmacy etc
username here	As someone who work in the pharmacy world there is a huge problem with pharmaceutical company They are company just like any other and the first 7 if I remember right year a New drug is made it s manufacturer ha exclusive right to sell it is where they make a lot of money So if it is a lifesaving drug for the first decade people who need it will be paying exceptionally high price
Jonathan Griggs	Yeeesssss more videooooooosss
Leonard Church	Hm Very informative thx for the morning news It help when I need to be more WOKE
Bill Rules	Sometimes Trump admin doesn t do horrible blatantly corrupt shit Sometimes they just propose rule that are toothless and unlikely to accomplish the stated goal I guess that s a little better
Nick Richardson	Love the new bullet point graphic
Trio C	I like the extra show but a a non American many of your extra show are of zero interest to me Can we get more global stuff
rstnpce33 YouTube	Hey Walgreens pharmacy technician here drug are WAAAY overpriced I sell maybe 50 or more prescription a day and I have the ability to not only look up the price before insurance of a drug but also the generic equivalent price and how much we paid for it a a store and thus our markup I think one of the worst drug that s incredibly expensive is drug like viagra or other equivalent Typically they can be up to 50 per pill for the brand And although upping the pill amount on a prescription can lower the price per pill down to maybe 40 that s still for some men 400 a month which is 10 pill or if they wanted a full 30 day supply it d be 1200 Insurance also hardly cover any of that maybe covering 10 of the patient is lucky The generic equivalent isnt much better maybe costing 35 a pill instead of 40 50 Most of the problem actually come from pharma company charging outrageous price for their product Although pharmacy to mark up price to make profit on most drug the markup isnt entirely outrageous although dont get me wrong some of them ARE outrageous But typically the markup is 10 25 at most meaning that those high price are mostly due to pharma company charging sometimes hundred of dollar per pill some AIDS related medication can cost insane amount of money I hope that price come down for the sake of patient I sell prescription to every day I think the worst thing for me is to tell an older patient that their prescription is 100 more than it wa last month simply because their med D coverage is in the donut hole or the coverage gap meaning at that stage in their insurance the insurance company jack up price every month until they meet some sort of magic number in which afterwards most medication will be free or near free Well this is until the year start again in which case they have to go through it all over This wouldn t be so much of an issue if instead of their life saving prescription costing 600 per month they only cost 100 or even le And when you ve got an older patient with 5 or 6 prescription and their in the donut hole they could easily be spending upwards of 1000 per month on prescription even AFTER insurance We need more pharmaceutical company that produce more competition and aren t in cahoot with each other and the insurance company
superswaglord1945	ORANGE MAN BAD
J Hitchcock	The death might be permanent Say it isn t so And no nothing is going to get big pharma to lower price except price control These shark don t feel shame
Stewart Wani	So speaking a a medical student in a country where advertising medical service is prohibited my knee jerk reaction is generally a positive one Something we encounter a lot in hospital is people struggling to gather fund to pay for treatment particularly when the patient is a breadwinner whose ability to work to pay for his treatment is hindered by his condition In my opinion full disclosure is of paramount importance with people s life and livelihood on the line and I m all for patient being able to make fully informed decision I understand the logic against it the price can indeed be dissuasive particularly in the US where it s no secret that healthcare is expensive compared to other country but I think that choice should be left with the patient especially if they have all of their option laid out for them I don t get how this is a violation of First Amendment right though
ParadoxBrony	Consumer transparency is never a bad thing
Katelyn Hanson	if man color color orange man Bad true
DrChin Strap	Well they keep prescribing shit for literally anything so
Sabrina Nicole	LOVE morning show
TheRealRedWolf	I am Anti Trump administration a much a the next Lefty but I am willing to admit someone s right doing a much a their wrongdoing I think this is a smart solid move on Trump s part
James	Trump2020
Nickolas Mazurek	I work a a Pharmacy Technician in Texas and full disclosure would definitely help with patient choose medication however most medication price differ from pharmacy to pharmacy a the cash price is the manufacturer s price plus an amount the pharmacy charge for the medication so an advertisement with the cash price wont always be an accurate representation of what the patient could pay out of pocket this along with individual patient insurance plan will only increase confusion on how much the patient will be paying and the only way they ll know for sure is by contacting the pharmacy for a cash price on a medication or by contacting their insurance company for their price
Robert Cornwell	Wow trump doing something positive I ’ d like more of this please
David Moran	I work in a pharmacy and this would be so amazing How many people I ’ ve had come to me looking for drug they advertise and almost every single one is not covered at all Some people don ’ t even need it but because they saw it on TV they THINK they need it I know by working in the pharmacy I should be on the drug company side but I ’ m the complete opposite How many life saving drug cost over 1000 of dollar and how I try so hard to get them covered in a way shape or form Though for some insurance you can get a request from your dr to call the insurance to get them covered but it ’ s a 50 50 shot Worth it but that ’ s if your DR actually doe the request
DarkPaladins	I love the morning vids 1 2 I dont know if a move like this will drive cost down but providing more information to the consumer is never a bad thing and I m all for this
Swifty Unknown	It s okay Phil They said to call my doctor if I die so I should be good
TheNeonOption	I am surprised but pleasantly so Also if having the full price cause confusion for certain customer maybe those customer SHOULDNT be taking medication that got recommended to them while they were watching Maury I feel like it is common knowledge to u Americans that insurance help pay for your medication Like It s really obvious lol And if you watch the add and AUTOMATICALLY assume that insurance won t help you you clearly don t understand how going to the hospital pharmacy and getting billed work and honestly someone ha to teach them or take over their medical matter for them bc they need help understanding unless you have really really shitty insurance or something but even then you would think people would have the thought to look up more info and alternative online
SecondChance Man	Heck yeah Go trump administration
The Last Sleepless City	Absolutely love the morning show Phil You and your team are the best and I hope you guy manage to make it work long term
Salty P	If you think any of these vague rule are going to help the consumer Well I ll just be nice and say that you are wrong and probably get distracted by shiny thing singlepayer
lolkatiekat	1 Insurance is not guaranteed to cover a medication Even if it doe most of the time insurance will automatically switch you to a generic a it is cheaper Letting people know the full price of a medication allows them to make a choice a most of the time the higher the initial cost of the medication the higher you have to pay out of pocket 2 Saying that publicly shaming a company won t lower price is BS If a company is charging outrageously for a medication the patient is more apt to discus another alternative with their doctor If the company isn t making money on a medication because everybody is going with the cheaper alternative they will lower price
Ian	My Cosentyx is 62k a year or 2500 per shot two shot a month Thank satan for insurance
Younis Hajeer	HELLO HELLO
U.G.I.	News Marzia quit youtube
Jose Pangelinan	17K like in 3 hour
Tayen Mellick	I have never understood drug ad even a someone in the pharmacy industry I ’ m a pharmacy tech No one is ever willing to pay for brand name product and insurance frequently doesn ’ t cover them and they typically wait until a generic is available before considering it a an option
One of One	70 of America is on prescription med wow
Joshua Snyman	I think the big thing is showing the competitor price is higher than yours that s when they lower their price to yours
ToonsOff Fun	If you need a drug after watching a comersial it ’ s something ” wrong ” with you If you have a real problem say it to your doctor and he or she may perscribe the best drug for you
Big Boss '	Personally I don ’ t really care about this whole thing but it ’ s nice to see our president do a decent thing for once
Mike tracy	Hello hello welcome to the morning show I think we found the slogan for the morning show
Adam Christiansen	every now and then trump ha a good idea i dont think it will be easy to make change here and i suspect no real change will come unless the administration can some how force regulatory pricing with drug mfgs but still it a good idea
Saad Salman	I m Incredibly surprised Never in my life did I think Donal Trump would take a stance against big pharma and especially not after he nominated Azar who basically looked like the Ajit Pai of big pharma I m surprised and hopeful here but my cynical brain can t help but think there s something behind a curtain here Hopefully not
Nick Kopchenko	I think you should talk about the Dirty Money episode Drug Short available on Netflix BigPharma price gouging some desperately needed pharmaceutical
burke615	I am cautiously optimistic Of course the devil is in the detail specifically how they will regulate this and how well
Unusual Practical life	I want this I don ’ t think there is enough transparency in the medical field Thank you for the morning addition
Lil Torb	This timing is so good keep it up
Mark Riley	I feel informed Thank you
Romeo Twaje	Companies shouldn t be allowed to overprices you for product that are meant to better your health However I don t how effective it will be adding a price tag it will be a good step foward but it will only work if there is competition to compare different price
Dawn Revisions	love the extra morning vid
Dirk Walker	I support pretty much all regulation on the drug industry Profiting by taking advantage of the sick is capitalism at it s worse Regulate the hell of out of em
Bunnsie	I dont think it will change price but I think an informed public is a better public If you can make more informed choice you re better off I m just hoping that if this doe happen it happens in more than just tv ad
Sabrina	Funny I wa just talking to people how despite terrible sleep much of the time I try so many sleep aid other than pharmaceutical because I find the list of side effect ridiculous Feels like a good percent are worse than or escalation of what you re treating But in broad term I ve always hated how a brand hike up price and there s so many factor bedepending on the condition but generic offering are so much cheaper and not noticibly different I ve always gone generic first factor the price
Calvin Pyles	Put in the advertisement the price of the drug clearly Then under it put a disclaimer saying that it is the base price and insurance company may very on compensation Both clearly legible
Samantha Dettman	I think this would be great As someone who ha struggled with depression and anxiety for year and generic drug not being effective for me it wa extremely difficult on my dad a I wa a teenager to pay the 65 month price tag for the main anti depressant I wa on and that wa WITH insurance I ’ m still on that drug and luckily they have released a generic version that cost only about 4 5 but I ’ m still on one last drug that cost 80 month again WITH INSURANCE Though I ’ m not one to always “ talk to my doctor ” about the different drug on TV or in magazine I think it would be important and significantly better for the company to at the very least post the price to their website Almost every doctor office I ’ ve been in ha those “ Save 75 or more on your prescription ” card for people without or minimal insurance I think it would be extremely beneficial to the consumer to see the full price that they could pay and figure out if they ’ re willing to risk paying that much because of their insurance or lack there of
Mighty Miguel	I think the morning uploads are awesome keep doing it a long a you feel that it s not infringing and your life so you don t have to stress about family problem and other life problem
Mike Kraner-Henthorn	outstanding idea you check the price of everything else you by why not your script it should be for every add no matter where it is
Sebastian Rose	Very informative These kinda story are the one i want to be most informed about a it likely affect most Americans day to day life Thank you Phil and everyone working with you for a fantastic video
coolrunnings	A great first step by the administration They be doing some interesting thing and being quite successful of late
Andrew Brennan	Companies do not have first amendment right Companies are not citizen and should not be treated a such
Volamos	More like this Phil More politics le celebrity please
KeishaJL	I love any extra news stuff from you or the group but I totally understand if you don t want to keep it up I know 4am you were probably up ya know kid n all but it can t be easy to keep this up a well a your show So that s my unhelpful review of the early show
Corrupted Archangel	A lot of corporate shill grasping at straw in this trying to justify the jacking up of price on drug Just to look back at a lifesaving antiparasitic drug called Daraprim which saw an increase in price from 13 50 to 750 00 If they have to advertise price it will be a lot harder for them to raise it annually
Emily Treacy	Over the year I have become apart of the chronic illness community Because of this I have seen actually how Advertisements of drug can actually hurt consumer asking for medication that they don ’ t actually need but on the other hand they can start a conversation with their doctor about serious topic so it ’ s a sticky subject But I do you like this new initiative it will show actually how much people like u spend on medication one of my new medication are almost a much a the cancer drug even though I only use it for migraine Another one that I take for narcolepsy is considered an orphan drug so it ’ s under this certain law that I have to pay a lot of money because there is a loophole that it ha a patent for seven year that no one can make this certain type of medication so I have to pay an out rage amount But I have to pay that because I need that medication to simply function every day I like that this is opening people eye to actually how much medication even if it is before insurance
Noodles.	why do they cost so much
Xenomorph King	Thats pretty gud
Michael Goodwin	I honestly believe the pharmaceutical company aren t actually there to help you If they truly helped you they d be putting themselves out of business If they cure cancer they lose trillion of dollar in cancer treatment revenue The same can be said about heart disease stroke diabetes Alzheimer s etc This is a prime example a to why capitalism isn t a good thing a there is more focus on keeping you sick then actually helping you Helping you loss the money keeping you sick make them billionaire
Travis Romig	They just need to put the market retail price like car and the hospital or Dr can WOW them with a discounted price Oh ya your insurance company get some random HUGE bill for everything including drug then reduce then they negotiate a price or they will force the person to do business else where or buy a different drug
WickedWood04	I strongly dislike everything Trump ha done pretty much This seems like it would be a good idea
Nathaniel Anderson	THIS This is the type of new content I signed up for and I hope we get to see more of it in the future 👍🏻
Brandon Cue	I fucking love morning show
deshtom	I think this is a great idea but not necessarily because I think it ’ s going to lower price
Mitch Seward	Trump did something good You can ’ t deny it
slothboy 889	This would be a good step in the right direction but I still want to government to set cap on drug price
Christopher Garcia	I honestly don t care if it cause Rx price to come down though for competitive reason I think it will I wholeheartedly believe that consumer should have all reasonable and relevant information for any and all consumable product Besides we all know they ll add in the line about asking your doctor carrier about discount option for X because user usually do get a discount through Medicare and other private plan
gianfranco calle	I ’ m closer to a libertarian and I despise trump a a person but I have not even heard of any significant change to big pharma in year Between me and another family member we have about 10 prescription monthly so a long a there is some change or attempt at it it ’ s better than nothing even if it not all of it go through or work it ’ s something which is better than just watching my cost to live rise and rise with no fight back
Sanity	This is super knit picky but the font and animation at 4 20 felt like a middle schooler s PowerPoint presentation
Robbie Mullen	Hearing someone say buy prescription is weird being from uk
Anton.d09	No not surprised He talked about this during his campaign
CubeLock IV_V_VI	Like the graphic added nice touch
Dustin Seifert	I really like the new format for the bonus show thanks Phil
Erik	While I agree that shaming pharma on their high price will probably not lead to lower price we should be talking about other medium As many study have pointed out that cable subscription count are lowering This act should be expanded to all form of advertising To truely lower the price of drug I believe we need to lower how long patent protection exists On top of that generic company should be able to purchase sample of the competition to compare performance It s nice to see the Trump administration do something other than be slanderous
Jaden	It violates the first amendment Tell me how many NDAs do you have people sign per year I bet it much higher than zero
Nicholas Frechen	Trump doing another good thing Hated the guy Don t like his personality First president though that s actually cared about AMERICANS At some point the left is going to need more than racist sexist xenophobic anti immigrant wife is 1 etc Ever think maybe the medium is a corporation owned by many of the same people and hated him for those reason Renegotiated the worst trade deal ever the left hated it when I wa on that side want border every nation need them esp with big social program ha won the tariff war with China and Europe Has Europe and other rich country paying what they should on defense Is keeping our power from going to unelected body Lowered tax Has the economy near the best it s EVER been when we had been told 2 growth is the new normal Is about to give a 10 break on tax for the middle class Has made relationship pretty good with north korea when obama said we had been close to war a he left I could go on Point is if someone doe a good job you don t have to like him He s also shown how ridiculously far the medium and Democrats will go for power Democrats have called for near violence 4 Republicans have been stabbed or attacked Not including verbally The left now want socialism and censorship not just social program that s very different They ve shown hypocrisy on stuff like Corey booker being accused of assaulting a democratic gay man with witness They ve ignored that super rich guy beating his wife in the democratic party They aren t the same party a the party of union They are using people s difference to gain power They are literally anti American It s sad Just hope people pay attention already to what the guy is doing Not what the medium is saying
mrmarcus1337	They should have pricing information on the screen While we are at it can we get some anti trust bust going to Silicon Valley
Eric Booyse	I think it a prety good move If the same company are competing for the same market they can now use price a a good strategy
neomags	Thanks for Pilling u in Phil
Sparrisguy	death is permanent OMG
Burt Shipman	Philly D a k a Daddy Shark
Brooke Nykamp	There need to be crackdown on the pharma company and this is a place to start As someone who ha been very ill most her life I have seen some of the underworkings behind the scene and it s disgusting and mind blowing how much go on without our knowledge
Isaiah Gay	I think that it will be a good thing for drug company to show their price in ALL promotional material because when I wa going through my cancer treatment I had to take Neupogen which is supposed to boost the growth of white blood cell this drug cost 300 a needle and wa only sold in pack of 10 even though my insurance covered half of the price that ’ s still a lot of money and I didn ’ t find out until after my treatment were done that there wa a cheaper option
Supergforce777	But who still watch tv tho
Aidan Renneker	You gon na talk about Roman Reigns
Reason Peason	I love everything about this because it give and incentive for competitive pricing between brand but also it is more beneficial to a population that is dependent on these kind of drug I think As someone with ADHD I wa first recommended a brand drug that wa still 300 dollar a month after insurance before considering a different one that only cost me 26 a month The pricing in term of insurance can be coupled with a disclaimer “ price may vary depending on insurance ” and be done with it I ’ d have to look more into the detail but on the surface this seems like a really good thing for those of u dependent on med already and those who do t know if they can even afford them but are considering I just kind of wish something could be done about doctor pushing a certain brand on patient before exploring other option but that ’ s a different beast As for the morning show I love them but if it ’ s too much to get used to or to have regularly scheduled it might not be worth the strain
Amenty	Yay more Phil More PDS is always loved here 3
Jozette Xie	They are just trying to get u addicted to drug stop falling for it
S Clair	Im pretty happy with the republican on this one they seem to have listened to their base concern about this I don t think it will lower drug price in the US though you just can t negotiate something you need to stay healthy from the statistic of other western country it look a lot like the only real way to get affordable healthcare is to have socialised healthcare
Colin Redmann	I m not a huge fan of Trump but out of some of the thing he doe I like is this right here I do like his approach twords lowering price of prescription drug As a person who ha to use on a regular basis and I hope that the POTUS will do the right thing
Para Nicaragua	Was able to watch this a I got ready for work Great video AND really Really PHRMA Your 1st amendement right 😂😂😂
Uhlbelk	As a doctor I see this a a people being stupid problem For drug to be FDA approved they must show equal or better efficacy than standard medicine already available Which mean when a patient go to their doctor and they are already on medication for that problem there is no medical reason to not give them that prescription I like the car analogy because it come down to what the patient want to spend their money on Most state have a requirement that all prescription be able to be downgraded to a generic equivalent For instance if you take your Lipitor prescription to the pharmacy you will be given the generic atorvastatin unless you ask for lipitor For this reason drug company almost universally drop the regular brand drug a soon a it go generic but they have trick for this where they combine that drug with another drug that is typically given to the same patient or they change the formula for the pill to make it release slower or something that make it significantly different than the original in order to make a new patent and they hope the brand name recognition will get patient to ask for the new one
Tom Smith	The first good thing Donald Drumpf ha done
zach123101	1 08 permanent death that s the worst kind
TBSE Gabriel	300 billion of that wa sold on the street and became illegal drug
Orien Louttit	Wouldn t it just be easier to ban drug advertising on TV I mean doctor in Canada do a great job of pushing pharmaceutical
Maheen Ahmed	Not a republican and very much dislike a lot of Trump s policy but I think it s great move in the right direction
fearlesslife21	I am loving this idea and really hope it work As to the pharma company saying it would potentially stop people from getting the medicine they need I am calling BS This would actually make it to where doctor could do their job and cut back on people self diagnosing and demanding med they may not need or the wrong particular drug for their case As a consumer who ha to take multiple med a day this stand to be a good thing and I firmly believe that everyone know the price the commercial show would be the price if you didn t have insurance Hell I needed medicine once from an very niche specialty pharmacy and upon getting there wa told seven pill wa going to cost me thirty thousand dollar Thanks to insurance that got cut drastically though if they had only told me the price after insurance I would have balked a lot more if I had not known the out of pocket price Also knowing that kind of thing up front would better explain to certain people why a certain medicine wa costing more than their other med Manufacturing cost make a huge difference and if we are to be better consumer we need to know this
Aaron M	let talk about your prescription
WolfgangLMclain	Oh pro consumer action Yea I ll be behind that one 100
kolossarthas	if trump admin can pull this off it will give me hope that they can actually do something about the opioid epidemic
Rachel Orange	So we re going to save Trump s coming out a a nationalist for the evening PDS
Bipolar Corner	Prices are different with insurance and I don t really see how this would help anyone
Ossie	My prescription drug are free I m in Canada
Alix T.	Generally I feel like this is a good idea but I think the concern about patient being confused about what their insurance will cover and refusing medicine is a valid one I think that this is generally better addressed by provider discussing insurance and alternative if a patient brings it up rather than not advertising pricing though
Rikku Sayian	i miss joe
Seán Radcliffe	Midterms policy
chuckbuckets1	big pharma is so corrupted do whatever is possible to reign it in
Meówl	The excuse of price might be different due to insurance yeah it must be really hard to use the brain and add that text next to the price in the commercial
Vloggerihardlyknowher	I never thought I would say this but good job Trump administration
Eliza Huffman	Morning vlog Yay
Anj Craynock	That what happens now graphic is atrocious
Jeffrey Ball	This won t do anything for price especially if there is no alternative drug on the market I m sure many company will argue that their drug is unique or market their drug differently simply because of this However it will not effect the market The only way to get drug company to change the way they operate is to change how medical insurance work A drug doe not cost 100 but they must charge that much to get the 25 from the insurance company Since Obama made insurance mandatory which in theory is a great thing thing have only gotten worse with how the medical industry work The whole system is broken There are many country doing it better than u and we need to step up a a nation and take care of our people
Alyssa Arroyo	I wa kind of excited about this until it said there would be no requirement for internet ad More and more people are on the internet now and I think it important to keep that into account for advertising As for if it would lower the cost of drug Im doubtful But transparency is best regardless of this fact Patients can get a better idea of what the cost is before they see their doctor which is incredible important for financial reason Pharma just need to make sure they say the actual price and say price may vary depending on your Insurance
1337GameDev	4 11 Requiring price be advertised infringes first amendment right What the hell No it doesn t It s protecting and fully informing consumer who see a possible drug for their condition have hope for awhile before their appointment and then choose to buy the drug due to their hope If we did a study that looked at how many people would stomach high cost if they didn t know the price but hoped it would cure their issue for a prolonged period of time it likely would be MUCH higher than if people knew price up front which is playing psychological mind game Stop being scumbags PhRMA
Christopher Velez	Love it
Scott Blackford-Reeves	Im from the UK and ive always found it strange that american tv have like 5 min advert for a drug that sound like it doe more damage than good America is fucked up
33458productions	It seems like this is a play to increase trump approval rating before the mid term
Kyle Arban	Or how about this How about we don t let Pharma company dictate price Maybe the Gov t should give a crap and start negotiating pricing like other country do
Kill Me	Phil go to bed
Tabatha Grove-Dow	Anything that can get pharmaceutical company to be transparent and give u choice would be great My son requires an epipen a he is deathly allergic to peanut and the epipen price make it so i cant have spare pen for school nurse he just ha to carry it everywhere and school staff is constantly losing his backpack where his pen is Its terrifying when your kid ha that kind of allergy and when price for medicine he need are so high and i cant get spare pen everyone suffers These company need to have restriction on how high they can charge compared to how much it cost They are profiting big off of American s misery
Eli Last	I am shocked but happy the administration is taking this issue on While it remains to be seen if it will have an effect on price it increase transparency and show big pharma that our government will take step to protect u
TendedTadpole2	That Pharma reasoning against this wa complete bull “ Prices might be different ” no shit same with Cars like they ’ re comparing it to This should be bipartisan because everyone hate big Pharma
redflagwaving008	I love having some PhillyD in the morning
Steve Caamal	I like Phil
kcallamajaji	I m surprised that the Trump admin is trying to push this through Ultimately I don t think it ll make pharma change their price but I like the idea of their ad being more transparent Its absurd how much we a a country pay into pharma Thanks for sharing
hellcat1988	Yeah let force drug company to tell you how much it s going to cost you for this life saving drug but not do anything to actually make them more affordable on our end
Nathaniel Porter	This is a good change Transparency is always a good thing and competition help consumer
_Paws_	We pay more than people in Cuba I remember that from a documentary I also remember that prescription drug commercial are illegal in some country since it is similar to advertising illegal drug
Large seed	what the damn hippy liberal got to say about this thank god for president Trump
ManiacMoomin	The money is in the middle
Heather Andrew	I am not a fan of this move but nearly any move ha to be better than the existing procedure Doesn t it
Jonathan-Paul Marois	It smell of midterm don t you think
TheDaringPastry1313	1 08 coma or death a these may become permanent Yeah you dip shit voice death is permanent
TeknoGeek	Would the regulation make it so the ad couldnt say something like This drug cost but can be lowered based on your insurer
Reichiru	I ve always been kind of confused about the advertising of prescription I have never gone to my doctor and asked for a specific prescription Do people really do that Anyway I think this is a good step in the right direction against big pharma Just because their product isn t on a drug store shelf doesn t mean they shouldn t be upfront about how much it cost
radtex03	Price shaming That isn t the point of showing price It is to let consumer know what the price are so that they can consider them and look at the price of alternative That is what will bring price down
Rev JR	There s absolutely no reason prescription drug company should be advertising on television Any other product that s advertised I can simply go and buy I don t need to have a mechanic s note to buy a car I don t need to get my seamstress permission to buy some clothes I don t need to clear a candy bar with my insurance Drugs are advertised like these product showing people doing thing implying the drug make it possible to have the life depicted in the commercial It isn t a though drug company take the approach of certain advertiser like those who deliberately go the absurd route and you know it s not real Most everyone know for example that Skittles won t literally fall from a rainbow However with a drug advert most people don t know if the advertised drug will make them able to take longer hike or let them live more luxurious life There s one drug commercial series where time stop the victim is taken away by the EMTs then are shown back at the table like nothing ever happened because of the drug Am I to expect that if I take this drug after I have an incident I will miraculously get up and walk back to the table like nothing happened and like no one noticed Presumably the effect of the drug are not like the effect of skittle and are simply a marketing gimmick Most people expect drug to do thing but the average consumer probably couldn t tell you what that drug doe This is further compounded by the fact that the people in these commercial are effectively giving medical advice not anywhere in these commercial doe it say they aren t telling u we should ask our doctor if we have certain specific condition the implication of which is that their product will definitely address it like fast food address hunger when I ask my local drive thru attendant about a hamburger We need to eliminate prescription drug advertising from anywhere that isn t a doctor s office
shadowdagger2	If it s an issue with price just have them put an next to it saying price may vary based on health coverage boom done
A Troknya	I think that pharmaceutical ad should go the same direction a tobacco ad away They don t do anything good for consumer Let doctor prescribe you what you need Spend le on advertising and you have higher profit by default
Bori Gaming	hmmm 10am at work with coffee and what do i see a Philly video YUS
Jackrocks1201	Really liked this video Phil I really hope you continue to make these
Emerson	Can morning news be only for wholesome hopeful news There ’ s not enough of that discussed and I think everyone need that to start their day
Drew	No prescription drug Just heroin fent 10 day off though
TheUnexpected 103	America is the worst can ’ t believe how expensive drug are there
Chuck Nowakowski	it Can ’ t Hurt
View Sarasota	Great video
Stephystar	I doubt it will lower price immediately but at least consumer can shop around a bit while discussing with doctor Maybe in the long run if consumer are able to find the right medication at the lowest price it will instill competition However if a consumer ha little choice based on their medical condition I see no change
Michelle S.	Super interesting
Prof Google	This is simple economics guy Make market more competitive lower price however le profit therefore le research and development
Ryan Walsh	I don ’ t like most thing the current administration ha done but I ’ m not a blind hater As a progressive consumer protection are incredibly important to me so any step in the right direction no matter how small is a good one
Amy Y.	I am 100 in favor of more transparency in the pharmaceutical industry in any and all way but I also think putting the price in ad is not going to affect the pricing too much You can make create competitive pricing with car but with drug they re not all equal and you can t always substitute something just because another one is cheaper That s why the Shkreli s of the world can jack up the price of lifesaving medication sometimes it ha no alternative overnight Also pharma s argument about insurance is bullshit They shouldn t even be concerned about anything involving insurance That is an agreement the consumer ha with the insurance and they should let the actual party involved communicate
Icynox46	Yes please to anything that can possibly lower price
Tiffany Keeler	Report coma or death a these may become permanent 🙄🙄🙄
DaBigE67	Appreciate getting Philled In No I don t believe being shamed will have a price impact showing the competition price and shortening the time before a generic is allowed will impact price more
Ace Diamonds	price cap
Kitty745Kat	Live Footage of a Bear anyone
TailoFire	Love the morning video great for my schedule just this topic doesn t affect me Still I want more Since it s one topic instead of three it content may need to be more universal
VirtualFungus8	I m a pharmacy student and this is great it s always hard to get our patient the best price for their treatment and educating them more is only going to help u out
FrozenEternity	1 07 coma or death a these may become permanent lol what
katelyn ast	Good for them
California Phantom	It ’ s the first step that no other president ha done he really is trying to make thing better no matter how much the bias medium is saying
Matthew Eveland	An estimated 70 of Americans have at least one prescription WTF That is terrifying Pharmaceutical company provide an essential service but they do so in the most greedy and corrupt way Their lobbying is among the most disgusting of all major business Capitalism in America need to be checked
Frank Nitti	Thanks for the example I had no idea what these drug commercial were
Dew'ng It	I don ’ t know much about this topic but I think it ’ s a stretch to tie tv advertising a the main culprit of increased prescription use
Sid Jones	Death can become permanent
Carey Roberts	Never going to pas Big Pharma bribe too many politician already That is why the US doesn t have an abundance of generic drug version a cheap alternative already That is really one of the only two reason Canada ha cheaper drug that and we have a fixed drug markup rate regulation to allow profitability without price gouging
Sean Porcelli	List the average price of it with and without insurance across all state it available it
Cecilia Rodriguez	psst im a pharmacy tech student and there is a book that is just about the drug side effect brand and generic name how expensive it is and classification There are also website like drug com that give you all of that information
Andrew Criaris	2 thing 1 Put a bit more work into the high shool powerpoint slide it a little jarring seeing yellow bubble letter fall from the top of the screen when talking about big pharma 2 if drug company are so afraid of people being confused with different health care plan why not list the co pay for the major health insurer blue cross shield ect
Jenna Gets Creative	Lol the audio in the commercial Call your doctor if you have coma or death I think it s a little late to call your doctor if you re dead
h3ro11mcintyre	Everyone know that competition is better for the consumer long term Advertised competition is probably the best thing for the consumer when it come to retail product Vehicles food even real estate How could this not be good for consumer Yeah everyone pay a different price because of different health plan but that ultimately just highlight the flaw in our health care system I think listing base price for drug in ad is the best start to providing consumer with information
ExigentZero	Hello Hello I thought we were beautiful bastard Did the YouTube finally censor you
WiseOldDudee	coma or death a these might become permanent wut
Teh King	Who the fuck watch TV still bring it to internet ad too
mike g	It s a step in a good direction It won t be a quick change but more gradual so we will just have to wait and see how the pharma company react
Wylie Richardson	Comma or death a these may be permanent
The Sepulcher	This will have no effect on drug price The Government should put regulation in place that limit how much of a mark up company can place on their pharmaceutical These are not luxury item people need them to literally survive and there need to be control that keep company from holding patient hostage for their very life
Zeren Smith	Yummmy drug jk buy them legally
Andrew	We love yo face too Extra content is better than breakfast
Quirky View	There are example of where capitalism is a good thing and example of where it s a bad thing Medicine and car dealership are where it fails
ergnotagain	yah but who watch tv anymore lol
Banana Joe	Nice Animations They have really improved
SaphireKancer90	The real issue is that pharmaceutical have too much power on the cost of med take the epi pen for example The price went up for no valid reason other than the whim of the patent holder and the fact that those patent will never expire or are lengthy Regardless if they place the pricing if the cost is too high two thing will happen they the patient will not get it and the person s health will suffer or they will get it and their financial status will worsen on top of all their other debt credit card mortgage loan bill living expense etc Pharmaceuticals need to be regulated that s the only way thing will get better
choopy bohn	A little bit of a Jon Oliver feel I dig it
Brooklynn Bruce	My brother is 100 blind and take many medication I feel like that by not audibly saying the price it ’ s still hiding the fact that they are ridiculously high especially from visually impaired people 🙄
Invalid Comment	I believe that drug company should have to give a msrp just like the car company
Animelogic	Am kinda hopeing red wave win just saying
Damion Snodgrass	I ’ m hoping it will drop price price are ridiculous
Jessica D	I have not liked anything the trump presidency ha done just an opinion don t take it personal but this thank god Prescription company are like Wall Street screwing everyone over This a a great step in the right direction It s really shitty to be prescribed something and when you go to pick it up it s 600 just for a month There s so many problem I m just glad we re slowly starting to make them right
Great Googly Moogly	My 17 year old Canadian as forgot people have to pay for prescription our prescription are free until you ’ re 25 and then after that most work benefit cover it anyway
Patti Cakes	Their whole argument is b Yeah I ’ m sure when they passed the law making the drug company ’ s tell consumer about the side effect they had a similar argument “ well the symptom don ’ t apply to everyone and may persuade consumer to not buy their drug ” no you give u the correct information and let u make the decision for ourselves They do not have the right to make better decision for u
Cypruss Tk	This would be a first amendment issue if you want to know how much a medicine cost or if there is a cheaper alternative and how much it will cost along with any side effect just call your pharmacy I am concerned about the part that say give the pharmaceutical company an incentive to do so doe that not mean lining their pocket even more which would eventually be at the cost of the tax payer
Chris Diller	I feel like Pharma s argument is invalid let u know the price and we can check with our own insurance to see how much they will cover IF ANY and just because insurance may cover part of it doesn t mean they arent over charging example my wife s car got side swiped in a parking lot when I went to get an estimate I wa asked do you have insurance I said yes and they asked which carrier I told them and then they said OK it will be 3500 ish I then asked the guy with a wink how much would it be if I didn t have insurance he said 700 i know comparing auto repair to prescription med isn t exactly apple to apple but it show that people will manipulate whatever system they are a part of if there is no transparency
Motor Mouth Midget	Ok a an individual with special need who ha been on many medication in my 33 year of life there are 2 thing that stand out to me here the fact that they would be required to put the price on the screen in the ad but not have to verbally say it how doe that help someone who is blind who may not be able to watch the tv but can hear it Secondly have we forgotten about Pharma Dude I mean hell I would have thought that his antic would have made pharmaceutical company hide in fear of people starting to actively inquire about the price of the drug they are prescribed I think that measure absolutely need to be taken to force big pharma to lower their price Honestly the pharmaceutical industry should be nonprofit because you should not be allowed to profit off of someone s health or lack thereof My mother is a pharmacy tech for an independent pharmacy and I can t even tell you the story I ve heard about how frighteningly high some drug are One off the top of my head I don t know the specific name of the drug but I know it is a cancer drug It is listed at 30 000 for a 30 day supply and more often than not is not covered by insurance so imagine having to pay out of pocket to keep yourself or your loved one alive for 30 day at a time paying for this shit out of pocket I hope President Trump absolutely hold the industry responsible for their action up til now I truly appreciate video like this that you put out especially when it ha a direct correlation to something that directly impact something in my life Thank you Phil
Virgil	Yes more morning show Missed these from the last few week
KCJOHN08	Nice graphic package
Sam Wilson	My daughter wa diagnosed THIS YEAR in May 2018 with an incurable lifelong hereditary genetic disease She ha Addison s disease She ha to take medication every single day three time a day just to stay out of the hospital and function normally When California Children s Services stop covering her medication and her insurance doesn t cover her LIFE SAVING medication I m going to have to pay OUT OF MY POCKET over 200 A MONTH just to make sure my child doesn t die The generic medication are over 200 The name brand are double that And one can t even be gotten in name brand anymore Pharmaceutical company don t make it anymore 1 in 10 000 people have primary Addison s disease and pharmaceutical company are basically saying screw off to people who don t have access to generic medication I personally feel that if social medium is going to harvest my data and know what I m purchasing or searching for online they can sure and fuck provide me information about with cheaper alternative to my child s life saving medication
Shaun Zafar	This is extremely progressive for an administration that s so far seemed hell bent on moving backwards Good job Trump Administration Let s hope you don t screw this pooch
Don Manley	Advertisements are commercial speech not political speech they are trying to sell something so the argument the drug company free speech is being violated is false and any unbiased uncorrupted court would rule that way
King	I love watching Trump hater trying to find a way to make even good thing he doe seem bad They hate that he s done amazing
Cmtfrblnum22SYD	Good vid great topic
soul_kit-cat	Are you going to cover the Trump administration ’ s plan to redefine legal gender As a transgender man I feel like it ’ s important
Claudia Ivy	I would want them to completely get rid of advertising drug on tv but i think this is good it will also show how much some prescription drug cost
Just Bloom	Drugs are a no no thing
ItsSquidLive Twitch	Even if price don t come down part of the blue print is to boost competition Most of these drug made by different company are the same just with different name attached Motrin is still Motrin whether it ha the high priced Ibuprofen name on it or not So if price shaming doesn t work losing customer to other company will
hobokevy	My initial thought and takeaway Who buy the most Rx drug Elderly Who vote the most Elderly Who lean right Elderly What event is coming up on Nov 6 Right Some fairly toothless rule aimed at an already unpopular industry to convince the elderly voting bloc that Trump and the GOP have got their interest in heart while in reality accomplishing little to fight drug price
NorthObsidianG	Personally I fricking despise those ad For an half a hour show there a ton of it every second is a fucking ad and nearly all of it doesn t even concern me all I want to do is finish my fucking show so good I hope such a thing passed even when the administration is getting bombarded by those rotten lobbyist I hope it becomes law
Skyace13	Hey loved the bite sized morning show I love being able to see the part of the news I care about easily instead of skipping to the part of the show I actually care about on the main show I know it s not conducive to YouTube monetization formula but I appreciate it On the drug thing I m not sure it will work however something is usually better than nothing I guess Overly expensive healthcare is clearly a problem and having a list price help people notice the amount of price inflation that occurs due to thing being covered by insurance
Bill Gross	Love the quick bite in the morning
Grace O	Whether it ultimately effect price or not it s a great idea and I m 100 on board with this
Gazorpa Zorp	Hello hello you ’ re Phil de Franco
Kanjimoto Scuzz	Love it DeFranco But i feel your missimg something
ShadowFlame	As someone who s on a few different prescription med for my mental illness I m somewhat hopeful that this proposal work a intended I am somewhat skeptical of it effectiveness however because putting the responsibility of payment entirely on the drug company could lead to the price just being listed in the tiny text with all the other unannounced data Furthermore I am very surprised to see the Trump administration enact something like this that could very well have purely beneficial side effect In my eye many thing that the Trump administration ha done ha been in the interest of the American people but ha caused unnecessary pain to foreigner Regardless this is only a proposal and the fact that they are taking comment on it could lead to it being modified to be more effective
Shawn Ziemba	1 07 Coma or death because these may become permanent Wait are they telling u they KNOW that death is possibly not permanent I knew it they are hiding it from u
Hannah Y	The more transparency we have in the pharmaceutical industry the better Hopefully it ’ s a step forward that will move the health insurance company to do the same Imo the healthcare market is so complicated and disorganized and any move towards consumer education could be a good idea barring any evil stuff hidden in this proposal
Azarath Dragoneel	Wow Rachel sax look like an angry nutsack
D Culver	I honestly don t see how making sure consumer know the cost of what they are buying and any alternative could be seen a a negative in anyone except the abusive pharmaceutical campanies eye
BlackStar29	Transparency is a good thing think about how outraged people became over Epi Pen cost didn t go down but cheaper generic version appeared on the market I m more interested in the idea of the government negotiating drug cost The fact that the exact same drug is 2 3x more expensive in the US over Canada is disgusting Making billion off of sick people because they can Make you re money but this level of greed is gross
Xenos Tyrant	I don t like Trump or his politics However this is a step in right direction although much much more is required
WheresMyAle1990	5000 for a course of medication And I complained my prescription had gone up to £8 80
LIMP FR0G	I typically dislike trump but I appreciate this greatly if it can lower drug price
Fairywolf222	I loved the way this video wa set up The bullet point and visual aid were extremely helpful You can go a little fast sometimes not a bad thing so it is helpful to have something to follow along with What a great way to start the morning Thanks
Ash Kebora	I d much rather buy drug from Canada than even attempt to rely on shame to bring price down If shame worked on most of these people the world would be a completely different place Doesn t anyone remember Shkreli That jerk thrived by pissing people off
pink	“ If you ’ re experiencing death please contact a doctor This may be permanent ”
HULK likes green charts	I thought drug are for people with issue But then again it America
ibigfire	This is an incredibly minor issue Yeah sure I would say it s a good thing to implement but I m the end it will have such minor effect it doesn t seem worth being concerned with one way or the other They ll put price in tiny text along with a bunch of other text and it won t mean anything at all Now if we were talking about you guy banning ad for medicine altogether then I d be interested in the idea and discussion
Sarah Quinette	I work for a Mail Order Pharmacy that is also a Prescription Benefits Manager so this is something that I can shed some light on While this could be a good thing that the drug company would be forced to show the list rice of their med it WOULd and DOES lead to immense confusion for the consumer When it come to drug cost there are actually three price of the medication You have the Current List Price which is how much the manufacturer charge pharmacy for that quantity of the drug then you have Approved Cost which is what your Insurance plan ha basically negotiated the total Cost down to for you and the last is the Copay Coinsurance also known a Patient Pay So let s say that for your Xarelto which ha no generic currently in the US the cost for 30 pill which you would take one pill per day is 1000 But you have great Rx insurance so the approved cost is only 750 and you went for the Gold standard plan so your copay is 50 Now imagine you see a commercial for the drug and that 1k price tag Most people would panic or avoid the drug because they don t factor the rest Now imagine you are over 65 and have no choice but to take the med or die There are way to keep drug cost down for our most vulnerable this is not one of them
raney150	I m completely shocked at the Trump administration possibly doing something good Last time wa North Korea NK fell through so of this make it all the way he finally ha something good to talk about
Casey Webb	More morning video pls
Larry Brown	Love me some mornin Franco
abab AAbb	Death a these may become permanent
TheKazragore	Prescription drug ad on TV is just weird And unethical
DarkBass862	They re afraid that the listed price will dissuade people who need the drug from buying it That s only if the drug cost so much money that only people who have insurance can get it Oh wait
Me Cooper	1 06 Did Did they just say that death may be a permanent symptom Wtf
Mariah Paredes	I missed the morning show
Jack Elliott	Rather than just shame them the FCC could pull their ad Many advertiser have significant legal guideline that must be met to avoid fine or the removal of commercial shouldn t be crazy to add more guideline a they are necessary Source worked in commercial
Lymie Del Rey	While I must say this is the first Trump presidency move that I support I have little faith it ’ ll change much Insurance company and big pharma know that if you need a perscription to live you need a perscription to live I have been incredibly sick for over 6 year and my family spent hundred of thousand out of pocket for perscriptions and treatment in just the first couple year It is absolutely criminal and inhumane not only am I so sick that if I didn ’ t have a family I would mercy kill myself obviously too sick to even have a part time job so money is nonexsistent but I also have no choice but to pay more money than imaginable because the other option is death when I shouldn ’ t have to worry about paying at since I have more than anyone ever should to deal with already While I suffer insurance and big pharma profit Not to mention the only reason I ’ m sick is because I wasn ’ t treated in time because insurance company wanted to make more money off of chronic lyme disease patient by saying treatment is only 28 day So doctor won ’ t treat for chronic lyme since it doesn ’ t legally exsist and everything then ha to be out of pocket But that ’ s another story I know everyone think chronic lyme is some conspiricy but it ha been my life for the past 6 year so it is very very real
Axel Sullivan	Testing yes More pd yes Less burn out yes Everyone s sleep schedule fucked Me being grateful oh honey yes
Craig S	coma or death As these might become permanent Who would have thought death might be permanent
obey art	cocaine is a hell of a drug Rick James mother f cker
Dee J	This is great There wa time doctor prescribed me something and I go and try to get it and it insanely expensive so I have to do my own research to find a cheaper alternative which isn t easy since price are not out there
PachaDash	Good They should be listing their price The pharma corp is such a scam While yes they help many patient many doctor are pushed by drug company to give patient drug instead of providing treatment to the root cause Instead big pharma corp is only interested in treating the symptom to keep you coming back for more convincing you that you can t live without these drug 99 of the time I never know what I will be paying until I get to the pharmacy and cash out And a good chunk of the time I need to refuse the drug treatment simply because I wa unaware of the price and unable to get an alternative unless I go back to the doctor and pay for ANOTHER visit Plus I feel a a society we are too reliant on drug to give u that quick and magical cure
Gorilla Biscuits	Wow imagine giving Trump credit for something good
Cluckery Duckery	Wait Trump admin did good Fuck credit where it s due
ufailowell	Wow Trump ha finally done something good Cool
Great Leader	But guy trump is literally hitler and is paid by big pharma Why would he go against his own side IM SO WOKE
Drake Gray	Please please please if you can manage it please keep doing these morning video My morning are always a little better after hearing you say you love my face
Maher	I love this morning show idea Please make it an actual thing And a a Canadian I personally can ’ t believe tv drug ad are still a thing down there I ’ d personally like to see them outlawed entirely
areyousure	Competition lower price If the price are easily available and advertised these company may be inclined to lower the price I saw The Fugitive we know that Pharmaceutical company are evil because they just hire one arm men to do their dirty work
Bygonya Raya	Hello people of the morning Or other timezones I am not a morning person at all but it s nice to see you here and to watch this in the morning Hope you have a lovely day
liam	I thought it wa a free country
MasterOfThe Universe	Why don t we just make it illegal to have drug add on TV I mean the rest of the world seems to think it s a good idea lol
Crash Klyse	Pharma is taking a business approach to it that doesn t exactly make a whole lot of sense If your argument is that knowing the price in the ad will deter one from purchasing the product they might need you can t also say competition will lead nowhere
Logan Mulkey	Love the new morning show idea More Phil always a great idea
bawsx	Some drug cost 100 a pill while in Mexico you can get a few bottle of the same drug for that price it would be more economical to get a flight abroad to get the medication but on the way back you ’ d be thrown in prison for trafficking Is that right
Ribotto Studio	Phil why you got ta upload so EARLY lol
Vanessa Barker	Wait I don t understand If the price of the drug or the cheaper alternative aren t shown in the ad do you Americans have no other way of getting this information I live in Belgium and we get ad for drug from time to time and they don t show these thing either but it s not necessary All these thing you can ask your pharmacist or doctor or even just consult an online pharmacy drugstore to check the price
Jack Fletcher	Hey um Here in Canada you aren t aloud advertise ANY prescription drug
Castillo Productions.	I work in the pharmacy industry and I think this is a great idea All these company just want your money it ’ s going to be hard for them to rip you off now especially since you can see the price and possibly consider a second option
808Fee	wow didn t expect that from Trump Not a bad thing
Gangrel gaming	Sounds like the drug company argument can get beat down if they put in a simple clause next to the price on the ad Saying Prices may vary with insurance and insurance plan Please consult doctor to find out if it s right for you
Raul J. Gomez	I feel good about Trump taking in the Pharmaceutical company More transparency sound like should be beneficial for baby boomer gen x retiring living longer
luis archuleta	OMG the price of the drug is the price of the drug regardless of your insurance In fact when your insurance spends more they charge more to everyone so fuck that defense from pharma
Drew Henderson	You should do some digging Philip and look at the kickback Doctors get for RX drug even throw you a easy bone levitra you strike me a one who need or us this RX drug on the regular and company like Bayer and how much they offer in incentive for a doctor to RX it v Udenafil a 70 cheaper product and guess what it two is also made by Bayer but ha no incentive for RX
Addison Starn	Great morning video
Jen Gormley	I live in the UK and find it crazy how drug medication is advertised in the US
ComfortablyNumb1969	Individuals have 1st ammendment right corporation DO NOT
Drummerette	As someone who take a handful of RX pill every day and one is 300 a month for a 30 day supply I hope something work
None Given	Wish pharma ad would go away because they are annoying and frequently have a very narrow target viewer It s a waste of time and money that could be spent on research and lowering price
Caroline Olivia	It really will confuse consumer I see price that people pay vary every day Maybe the commercial can put the average price and that it depends on your insurance Idk I feel like it would help yet really confuse people
George Ramirez	I guess if we can t turn healthcare into a free market and let it do it own thing this is the next best thing 🤷 hopefully the consequence of these new regulation will lead people into realizing how much we could benefit from an unregulated health system could be
Max Thurst	So long a you don t overwork yourself would love more of these video
Maximus	But but Drumpf
AsianGlow	This regulation will be 💯better than Obamacare The only problem is the USA also ha to crackdown via Anti Trust Laws and break up Big Pharma TBH every sector because the competition available is constantly dwindling
Mitt Romney XIIV	1 I feel like the requirement should extend to other form of advertising but television is a start I guess 2 I don t really see pharma corp lowering their price much because of this but it s a nice added bit of transparency regardless 3 The president of PhRMA trying to make this about 1st Amendment right is infuriating Like yeah he s technically right corporation are given 1st amendment right but this is just a blatant attempt to get out of regulation that only help the consumer and not the company 4 Don t agree with him on much but I m glad Trump is trying to get something good done in regard to the pharmaceutical industry
MadMethodMouse	I think Trump should work on the climate change first
FoldAPieceOfWater	Anything working against the BS of Pharma is a good thing in my book I m also pleasantly surprised this is happening in the trump administration But the rule should also definitely be adopted for website social medium and radio
Protemp	Not sure if it would lower price but I m all for it becoming a law The added transparency would be good If that didn t drop price it probably would cause them to lose buyer and affect these big pharmaceutical
Dayita Ray	I ’ m not even a Republican but the Trump administration did right with the hopefully new prescription drug law
zach crenshaw	I ’ m surprised that the Trump administration is doing this but they could help Americans a lot more by letting u buy drug from Canada
Pippapotamus	Drug company shouldn t be advertising on television to begin with It undermines professional health care provider i e your doctor and it s annoying AF when a patient come in thinking they know the best course of treatment because they saw a commercial of someone smiling and running through the field with their grandchild Let doctor do their damn job
DR	death becomes permanent Not if i have 2 life left
Sean	I hate trump but he got it right to force them to show how badly they a screwing people They are scared because the corruption will be obvious Unfortunately I don ’ t see them really losing the cost much There will be back lash and after 2 month or the news come up with something it will become just another thing that “ is how it is ” too many sheep
Jay Wall	Awesome report Phil This is the kind of reporting you can t get elsewhere a the network seldom report on Pharma their biggest advertiser I think the main result of this will be an end to the insurance pharma scam that ha driven the price up so high in the first place With pricing information in the ad people will have more information to help choose the best insurance for their specific need a well Time will tell Keep doing what you do
Farts ‘n Sharts	Lifting the Veil on the pharmaceutical industry is a big win for u all it s a shame the dems and the MSM will try to spin it into something negative since Trump is involved
Phantombit	It is no secret that the cost for medication is far above what it cost to make it this is meant to of set the cost it took to research it the problem is though that we have entered into a time where medication breakthrough is not actually happening a fast a the once did and instead patent are maintained by minute alteration in the formula to make it technically different and the price are not being reduced after the cost of research ha been made back in sale On the other hand there ha to be a reason for business to invest in medical research there is a reason that the US lead other nation in Medical innovation and that is because it is profitable in the US to innovate in the medical field let face it the people with the money that pay the people to come up with the breakthrough drug is not a good hearted person just doing it to help humanity they might be a good hearted person but they are doing it to make a profit So I am personally hesitant on how to feel about what this might do specifically the line about the government negotiating price I don t like the idea of the government negotiating price because when the government doe something it is always at the point of a gun maybe not directly but that is always the threat and when you threaten the person with the money they leave and take their money with them But having the price even if it wa a slide that showed the most common price with the top insurance company and full retail at the top would give a great deal more power to the consumer and also shed light on how broken the system is Ultimately I feel the price of drug would inevitably drop a sale drop but if it doesn t have an impact on sale then the price won t fall that being said an environment set to shame company for trying to make a profit is an enviornment that innovation becomse scarce in
jacob	Always love these morning vids Thank you for all ya do
rian nodland	Love these morning show fam Just commenting to help the algorithm in my best homer Simpson voice stuuupid algorithm 💪💪💪
Gabriel Badwolf	I ’ m not even American and I ’ m glad to hear about this change it ’ s a step in the right direction I ’ ve been on holiday to America before and I had to get an antibiotic for a severe skin infection I ’ d picked up wa not much problem really my travel insurance paid for it all What I do remember though is the antibiotic cost me 150 this wa back in the early 00s and I took the empty packet with me to the doctor next time I wa there after I came back to Northern Ireland and my Doctor wa shocked by the price I wasn ’ t really it is already something I know about the US how much you guy get extorted by the legal drug pusher over there and looked up out of curiosity how much she would charge me for the same antibiotic if I wa seeing her a a private patient and not under the NHS and it ’ s not even funny the price difference It wa something like £2 50 which would work out somewhere in the region of 3 4 She gave me back the container and said “ you may a well keep this empty pill box because you ’ ve obviously paid a lot of money for it because it wasn ’ t the content ”
Blaine Drummond	I have been a type 1diabetic since I wa a child I am now in my 20 and lead a very active lifestyle with a controlled diet to stay a healthy a I can I am extremely well treated relative to many diabetic with my Hemoglobin A1C level being nearly at non diabetic level All that said my greatest stress and worry day to day and long term is whether or not I will be able to continue to afford my treatment Insulin even generic branded insulin is exceptionally expensive largely due to obscene markup put on in by pharmaceutical company who know I literally have no choice but to pay because otherwise I will die a horrible death Without my medicine with which I am largely a very healthy young man I will go blind develop gangrene in my extremity and die a slow miserable death of sepsis and blood poisoning I don t think this law will directly impact me too much but it is definitely a step in the right direction The government need to take action to bring the price of these drug down I didn t vote for Trump and I don t support him to this day but if his administration manages to push this through and take further effective action against pharmaceutical company it will tilt the scale way further in his favor with me I can t afford to vote on multiple issue I have to worry about whether or not I m going to die in my 30 or 40 because I can t afford my medicine
Broc Stauffer	I feel like this would be a good thing But I ’ m not 100 sure I ’ m hoping that it would cause le people to use prescription
AxCos	Coma or death for these may become permanent I mean I WAS going to consider but now that you ve mentioned that possible grim result
C Moon	There are a lot of OTC drug that are available by prescription at a fraction of the cost due to insurance Zantac 150 90ct can be 14 00 OTC my prescription coverage make it so 90ct is 3 00
Fatnorth759	So trump is getting something right
InfatuatedCoconut	I am more bugged by the face that this only would apply to TV How many people watch TV commercial these day v how many people are on social medium why wouldn t it have to be all medium
Vaughn Gray	OMG could people be missing the point any more The real issue here is WHY ARE SO many people in need of prescription pill 6 increase year over year of a population of 320 million How can drug company be so sure that people will continue to be sick Because the cause is in plain sight and no one want to discus the role of diet and lifestyle This conversation should focus on the major killer of American and country that follow a Western diet heart disease cancer stroke and diabetes These are the majority of the people that use and require medication daily Want to reduce your drug cost annually how about take step to never get sick Here s the secret it what we eat and lack of emotional support that cause you to get sick Disease isn t inevitable and is actually le dependent on gene than 5 of all disease That aside drug are costly BECAUSE the middle man Companies and their drug product are beholden to their customer and that s the medical insurance company NOT the drug recipient With a guaranteed revenue at hand thanks to tax payer dollar you ll never see basic economic force at work While I certainly appreciate the concession inherent in upfront labelling that s not even remotely the primary cause of high price and should not be the focus for drug reform
Precious Crystal Fox Boi	Pharma is really trying to pull a this will infringe on the first amendment right
DriveByBodyPiercer	We should just ban drug company from advertising It s really not needed If you actually need medication then you ll seek out a doctor and figure out the best treatment These ad just get people to buy the most popular drug that they ve seen on TV even if there s a cheaper alternative because people would rather buy a drug that they ve heard of before
w00tyd00d	I honestly think this is a great step in the right direction any more transparency for consumer is A OK in my book The big thing I kinda feel like it fall short on is not requiring the same transparency through social medium or website It give me the impression Azar is still in the mindset that television is the biggest only ubiquitous medium platform that people consume information through daily which is starting to become le true everyday I feel like he should also be heavily focused on what pharmaceutical company advertise on the internet a in 10 15 year I truly think television will hold a minority in the technological census Newspapers and magazine I think are okay to exclude a price on pharmaceutical drug fluctuate so much and the information would be outdated easily but the internet doe not have this problem
Mendoras	Good that i live in a country where I can at max spend 100€ for prescription drug per year After that my health care cover the rest
Jeff Rosenbury	A free market is one where the participant are free to enter and leave the market at will As such there is no free market for drug or health care in general Lacking a free market to set price I support more government intervention not le
Fernando Onate	This might help insurance become cheaper if people know more of the price
TheAssassin2332	They NEED to expand beyond tv what they are going to do is skip television ad now and bombard our social medium platform with the ad instead because it an obvious loop hole We live in a whole new age of technology unlike 10 year ago thing HAVE to change to keep up with the generation Thomas jefferson once said “ the dead should not rule the living ” Edit by that i mean we aren ’ t a generation that mostly watch tv anymore we mostly use our phone or laptop
Liam Ace	coma or death a these may become permanent just had to get that one in there xD
Kerika	I do understand what they mean about it being misleading for a percentage of consumer who would have insurance coverage for the prescription But I also think there s a good number of people who don t have insurance or insurance that cover a lot of those prescription a well so it s good to have that transparency of if you have to pay out of pocket how much it will be I answer phone call for doctor s office and I ve gotten several people calling to request a different prescription than they were given because of the cost so it would certainly be nice to know especially when it s actually getting prescribed to you
FREAKout59	surprised trump is doing a good thing that s a first
Pamela Curtis	3 40 Nope nope nope that argument about patient missing out on a drug that they might need Jesus take the wheel If a patient NEEDS a drug they get it from their DOCTOR not their TV ETA This is not shaming drug company into lowering their price this is exposing long HIDDEN COSTS that drive up the price of insurance The whole medical system LOVES that we have no idea how much individual thing cost They pay for MRI machine by charging 7 PER Tylenol pill this is an old old issue I m ashamed of WUSTL law
StL ChuckO	This seems like political posturing to me Pharma acting like showing the pricing is a big deal while the politician act like they ’ re holding pharma ’ s foot to the fire I ’ ve seen better acting in porn and the WWE
alfonso ontiveros	Hmmm I am not american buuut are u people sure this Trupm is a monstruos a u guy been saying he is for the last couple of year cuz Never seen in my life even in my country an administration sticking it to the pharma Industrys in any way or capacity
victoria LoCicero	Please make this happen Prescription drug are so expensive One of mine that is a very common one is almost 300 and I think that is after insurance The only reason the company are fighting this is that they only care abut the money going into their pocket
Eamonn Kelly	Actually have a few thought First off the requirement should extend to all advertising medium not just television I can see an easy route to reinvest spending in to ad service for facebook and social platform that avoid television and these new rule Secondly I personally think that it could be of benefit to not only focus on pricing but also extend these new transparency requirement to include additional information such a wether or not a drug is being prescribed off label for a use that it wa not studied or approved for by the fda If the push is for transparency then putting these same rule in place for other egregious act that occur in this industry need to occur
Darth Dingus	Is it just me or Does the picture of Alex Azar look weird 1 53
neongreenfruit	If they are hoping to lower price I think allowing for more competition is the way to go on that one But this may be a good starting point
Starlight Kynthos	I love how in one of those commercial death is said to maybe become permanent so you become a vampire or a zombie or something Wtf
Super Smoke	That s really good to be honest
Suedocode	1 07 Since when can death become permanent
Racheal Bennett	This is a redirect the root issue isn ’ t the price it is the over reliance on medication Listing the price isn ’ t going to stop people from wanting the medication we are dumb and want quick fix insurance will cover it and doctor will still make money prescribing them Good job on the redirect though give trump something to point to thats “ positive ”
ThunderGod97	I used to work a a web developer for a marketing company that specialized in pharma doctor side not patient Pharma cost what it doe because of the cost involved with bringing a drug to market There is an insane amount of money spent to do that and sometimes it doesn t pay off I ve been involved with launch that never saw the light of day because it didn t pas FDA approval which come at the very end of my development after all my work is done I still got paid for my work and the company absorbed that cost Yes I would be one of the people updating their website to post that information about their price if I were still working for them There s also time where a drug had to be pulled from the market because of those side effect They either had to make it safer or they had to remove it completely and forever Death is a reality with some drug It is a side effect in some case but it is usually in extreme case They still have to mention it along with all other serious side effect to inform consumer and doctor so they can make the right decision Most people I ve dealt with in pharma are just trying to help people They offer way to make it more affordable They want to help people treat their condition and sometimes even cure them There are obviously some thing that need to change and I m glad the Trump administration is taking some step to reform it a bit The pharma industry definitely deserves a lot of criticism and there are some scummy practice with some part of the industry no one I dealt with fortunately My time working in the industry ha given my a valuable perspective on that industry
Dr. Mutagenic	Heck yea this would be great to promote competition and allow the people to easily monitor change in drug price but I think the benefit will be limited I can see this having an impact for some medication but what about the cost of IVs hep c cure drug for rare disease like Eculizumab costing 400K a year Not all drug rely on advertisement and I have a feeling that most don t
Trevor Townsend	Pharma is getting away with ridiculous price because our insurance system is completely broken This won ’ t have much of an impact a long a our insurance rate skyrocket and leave them in charge of bartering for a better yet still insane cost
Tea McBride	I love the morning video I love that they are one clear concise subject and that you can put the time necessary on the subject in these video I love your team and I love the work you do and I think in the morning video are a great addition and I wouldn t mind you doing personal ad and sponsor on them if I m getting this type of information and entertainment every time
Juliana D	Ya know what ’ s bullshit The ridiculous cost of Anti Psychotics
Dom	I love the morning show
BySam	THANK YOU for bringing back the morning show
Nicholas Barnhill	Why did I get unsubbed
Kara C	For the love of all thing holy and savory please stop testing the morning show and just make it permanent We want it
Tony Borden	Keep doing these
synchro505	These law tend to have an opposite effect on the overall outcome for the consumer loophole or hidden clause Will be interesting to see how this pan out
Deanosaur Of The Dead	The only problem is paying for Drugs
SomecallmeAsian	I feel like this is a good idea especially if it would lower the cost of prescription
Hans Pierre	Many video from you guy are a warm welcome Keep it going guy Thank You
Ben Moy	This is my topic a I m fresh out of pharmacy school 6 yr btw Here are my thought 1 Big pharma is annoying af and the cost of new drug are very high However the cost of getting a drug to market is not cheap and if you re going to spend million of dollar trying to develop a drug only to have the government reimburse you a fraction of that cost then there would be no incentive to make new drug in the first place 2 Like the video mentioned the list price on a TV ad would likely not accurately reflect the price that a consumer would pay at the pharmacy due to varying insurance coverage This is a huge issue One person could pay a 3 65 copay for a month s supply while another person is stuck paying the full thousand dollar list price 3 Most consumer do NOT have the health literacy to ass the risk benefit a drug based on it price point Overall this policy sound dumb to me There are other way to lower the cost of drug Don t forget that the main issue here is government healthcare spending
David Schleuning	It s great to see that America is leading the way in foolishness Drug advertising is so ludicrous it should be banned not negotiated Doctors in my opinion are whom should be prescribing medication not the ignorant public diagnosing itself
Fizzy Lifting Drink	I wa reading through the comment and many have brought up that death may become permanent 1 07 honestly I sort of tuned out that part and I usually do when those commercial come on but omg that is hilarious
Naomi	Not even close to being enough Showing a number on an ad won t change anything I can only assume the administration is trying to look a populist a possible before the midterm
acenog123	Trump is doing a good policy Woohoo Let s not get blinded by partisan bias and start supporting drug company because the president putting this through is a republican
Dominic Uliano	This a good start Informing the consumer will help them make better decision The list price should be posted on both TV and internet ad along with a listing on the drug company ’ s website
SupaEMT134	Thanks for not producing this video with a partisan bias 👍
Jacob Billings	love the vid im for the transparency
A Lone Boat	Wait you re telling me that death may be permanent shit
Wes Brazwell	It ’ s nice getting the actual full story from you I laughed pretty hard at all the faux news being spread about this However this is the equivalent of using a kitchen sponge to soak up the ocean Too little and of not a huge value Every little bit doe help but much more is needed to reign in Big Pharma
bagehi	I work in the industry A huge part of the problem is the convoluted method of pricing everything It hide a lot of gouging behavior on all level from PBMs to pharmaceutical manufacturer to wholesaler to pharmacy I think this move will not be itself reduce this However it is a step in the right direction in that it ha begun shining the spotlight on this bad behavior
Wilfredo Valle Jr	To state that the price would differ a a defense to this proposal is silly Every price tag out there is not what you actually spend And like they mention side effect may occur simply mention the cost may differ a well
Bamalo	Am I am I not a beautiful bastard anymore
VlogsWithSeth	I m not American I m Canadian lol
jonasn5	Got to say that Well yeah it is going to over the year lower the price If the professor in the story can not tell that she is doing something wrong because it simple If a consumer see it is too expensive they won t purchase it America already ha an issue with people not going to get medical help due to billing so this will if anything drive price down AND assist in making the decision once economically viable for that consumer
flip0052	but the Trump Admin is gon na kill million of Americas through healthcare
TheUpinsmoke10	what about the lifting of the Gag rule on pharmacist that Trump signed into law last week Have you talked about that I may have missed it if you did
Quint 256	I think this entire move is stupid Consumers need to do their own research and find the best option
Tom Will	I don t envy you guy in the US I have prescription for 4 med for chronic migraine just working out the cost would make them worse if I wa over there Here in the UK firstly you typically don t approach your doctor and tell them you want a certain drug that s CRAZY you tell them your symptom they diagnose you and they prescribe the best drug for the job All prescription cost the same no matter the drug if you are an inpatient in hospital you are not charged drug dispensed a an outpatient a prescription is £8 80 about 10 no matter what the drug is or for how long it is if it s a short course of antibiotic you pay £8 80 if it s ongoing treatment you get a month at a time and it s £8 80 for the month course If you are elderly the med are for kid have cancer pregnant on disability benefit employment support or several other support allowance you prescription is free If you take many medication long term you can buy a 3 month pre payment card for £29 10 or a 12 month card for £104 meaning no one in the UK should pay more than £104 a year for prescription in a year no matter how many you take No one should be spending a much a buying a new car on medication unless it s a lego car
Rainwing Silver	As someone whose work involves health insurance I honestly see both side have valid point however Price is very dependent on a lot of factor but I dont really think it s going to hurt drug company to add a list price anyway Most of the drug advertised are more expensive and typically a dr wont prescribe those until cheaper option have been exhausted Plus if they don t have to actually say it but just have it on the screen I doubt many people will read it
Kithanalane	I have a big problem with company claiming constitutional right A company is not a person and therefore doe not have constitutional right
Matt A	Good morning to you too
ThisIsMrJ	I think it is a good idea to post the price in ad especially for those who don ’ t have insurance But it is important to note that for those with insurance the price will vary It ’ s also a good idea for people to go online or call their prescription insurance to check the drug formulary and see what ’ s covered
Bianca Orchid	Being from Australia and working in the pharma industry and having a degree in advertising the idea of advertising prescription drug seems insane to me It go against so much that I ’ ve learnt about both industry I believe the US should take something from literally the rest of the world excluding NZ and stop the advertising all together But that ’ s coming from someone who life in a country with the PBS which is a scheme set up by the government that subsidises cost of vital medication
Polly Bonanzas	Call your doctor if you experience coma or death It may be permanent
erak	Evil Orange Man at it again
Facetentacles	I m just gon na be that guy that say if they d just legalize marijuana the pharmaceutical company would probably drop their price on a ton of shit to be competitive Obviously I just want them to legalize marijuana though and haven t really ever been on prescription drug so my opinion is invalid xD
tsubasa504	It is funny that you talk about this now because I am currently reading a book called Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime which is about corruption in the pharmaceutical company Definitely worth reading for people who want to understand more about drug and the safety of them
Barbara Lloyd	Watching this very closely a a baby boomer on medication Thank God I have a good insurance plan but still my health is failing just getting old and I know my prescription bill will and ha gone up I hope it will lead to drug becoming more affordable
Elise Weusthuis	Why are patient deciding what medicine they need What are doctor for if not that
Adam. C	a good idea from Trump not something you hear everyday it funny because I despise the man but because I have no political allegiance which allows me to agree or disagree with point from both side I can actually agree with Trump on this this the beauty of not being on the left or right
Lindsay Reynolds	I am surprised that Trumps Government is taking this on It might be more effective if they just disallowed direct to consumer advertising tho and maybe required drug company to get approval for their drug price That medication cost 5k per pill WHY doe it cost that Is that price fair and reasonable Those are question that they should be able to answer
BlackMartini	If you re afraid of the price of your product being shown then maybe your product cost too much
Cynthia D.	Knowledge is good Period I also know I can pay le or potentially more depending on my Rx insurance That s why I use the GoodRx app
TheAmerican Muffin	I find myself in the strange position of actually supporting a trump plan This isn t a fix all plan but I think it s a good start to tackling the drug industry
Jamie Drinkard	8 video a week I m gon na love this
Maxime Deslauriers	Phil Don ’ t pas me question this early in the morning Does anyone know if this will effect Canada
ebonix33	Go Trump pharmacy is making boat load of cash
Tyler Kolb	They should be listing price on their ad If they think people wont be interested in their drug because of the price maybe consider not selling it at such a ridiculous price Partial insurance coverage or not pharma charge WAY too much for these drug in America They need to be regulated
Robert D	Ironically though they increased the patent protection for their drug so you can t get a cheap generic a soon a you would like
herman hermanheimer	Canada ha these commercial too
Katrina O'Brien	I love the new video in the morning I m actually surprised that this admin is proposing this a it might actually be beneficial to people We will see if it change anything for the pharma company
Demosthenes	Sounds like a distraction from the transphobic dangerous threat this Regime is holding above our head
smokeandmaintain1	damn you up early it like 8 or 9 on the east coast keep hustlin man
ceaser williams	Trump never did release his tax info did he Transparency tho
Gamma Beastboy	hmm informative and helpful a always Phil I like the new workflow
Larz	Excuse me but WTF wa on 4 20 with this flying text like it s a power point presentation from 2000 I kinda lost it for a second and had to scroll back to recall what wa being talked about
Voltaic Fire	Yay morning video are back
OldNewgames101	Like the new editing style 👍
Student Engineer	YES A morning show Thank you
Corbin Buesch	Companies and corporation SHOULD NOT have a right to be looked at a a single person with freedom of speech
PowerOnline	I don t know if you got a new editor or what but if you did keep him if you didn t tell him to keep up the good work 👌
mike lyles	It could have a effect on lowering the cost but the fact that they are not required to show the lower price for online ad Pretty strong chance it won ’ t make a difference Your just see the tv ad for newer experimental drug that ’ s looking for new buyer the drug with strong consumer backing will just make more online ad It feel like it muted both side
MisterB	Whoa coma or death might be permanent FINALLY look like I found a hassle free cure for becoming the HighLander I would try some other medication a well but there can be only one
blahlbinoa	I like that they are being pushed to put the price in ad and it should be pushed into internet physical paper ad What they should do to get rid of the confusion is add in this wording is that the price varies depending on insurance and doesn t reflect the price listed
sleepyaxolotls	great story but Phil I beg of you Please change that cheesy font and animation of The big question what happens now it look like it from a kid show
Jessica Fuentes	Love the morning show seriously it get me up in the morning Thanks for all you do Phil
Lincoln Wise	Love the in depth dive Phil The only thing in America more corrupt than America is big pharma Trump s just tryna put America first ya feel MAGA
TAV	whether price go down or not transparency is still good Now I can laugh at the price and the stupid ad
Matty B	Love ya Phil The team is doing a great job Thanks for all the hard work
Emily B	I love all of the edits in this video As a visual learner it really helped me understand the content I know it ’ s probably more effort so it is a rarity but I thought I ’ d mention my appreciation
Kristi B	So Drug cost on tv commercial won t have much to do with how much a patient pay it ll just scare people I m not really against this happening a I m not a huge fan of drug commercial in the first place but just not sure what purpose this would serve
Christopher Henderson	Am I the only one wondering if they just woke up in an alternate reality where Trump all doe good thing O o
John Hepworth	My family ’ s yearly prescription cost without insurance would be more than 500 000 With insurance we just have to hit our out of pocket max which right now is 7 000 That ’ s crazy but damn am I grateful for those med because they are keeping my daughter alive
Totoro Aizawa 101	My only Perscription Drug is Doctor Mario
Maago	I m surprised the trump administration is actually willing to do something like this
Kira Veritas	Oooof 😧 dat echo
Sly Reborn	I take prescription drug and I think that this is a good move but I don t think the claim of the price being misleading is true Your doctor would be the one who may or may not prescribe it to you depending on your condition They re not obligated to give you the medication of whatever s advertised it s only recommended on TV if you experience specific symptom HOWEVER lowering the price may lead to a reduction of supply of a certain drug which will cause people to not have access to what they need to treat their symptom
Ashlee Michela	If they are worried about adding the price because they think it could be misleading just say “ this is the list price but it may vary depending on your drug coverage ” Not all insurance company will approve certain specialty drug automatically either You have to send in a prior auth with documentation supporting why you think the patient need this med Then they “ review ” it and choose to approve or deny it Then even if they do approve it your copay could still be 2000 month for a 5000 med Its ridiculous I could go on and on about how much I HATE insurance and drug company 😡
Jennifer Bureau	I personally think this is a horrible idea I am immediately drawn to think about mental health but my perspective applies to all medical condition A person could see the listed price of a drug that is ultimately the absolute best to treat their condition but then refuse the doctor s suggestion based on that price and end up going with a drug that won t be a big a benefit to them With the issue around mental health that our country face today creating a situation that may dissuade someone who need help from taking what they need is just counter intuitive Worse an alternative drug could make problem worse for them As mentioned in this video different insurance plan cover different drug at different rate The drug that appears to have the higher price could actually be cheaper for a patient than one that appears to save them money All in all I think this is the wrong way to solve for the rising cost of prescription drug in America
Justin C	Holy shit The first thing I can agree with the government on I feel like this is historic
Extremely Low Quality Content	Loving the morning PDS cause it give me another excuse to stay in bed for just a little bit longer
Rich Marceau	Limited to just TV advertising About a meaningful a telegraph advertising I can see excluding radio but it cost no time to put such information or a link to it on a web advertisement the extra byte aren t going to cost the advertiser anything
Andrew Czachowski	Hmmm tough to advertise price since different insurance pay different amount it s almost a if we should have universal standardized healthcare or something
Helix Snow	Death can become permanent NO SHIT
lostinwonderland	I literally put back a prescription due to price I couldn t even find out the price till it got filled I want this change to pas
Miles McCue	That ’ s funny cause I just got prescribed 4 different prescription lol
stacey 40	Pharma company need to b reigned in some how It s like the wild west
Adam Klase	Not to sound like a self righteous douche bag but the price for medicine even with insurance is one of the main reason I eat pretty clean and exercise daily Cuz that shit cheaper than getting fucked by Umbrella I mean big pharma
Fip Dibwibbler	Maybe we should stop pumping ourselves full of unnecessary medication to treat imaginary illness Especially with kid
Kathy Clysm	I am not an American but to me this seems like the first sensible thing to come our of the Trump administration America is famous for having a massive problem with people taking way to many drug and the pharma industry being way too powerful This seems like a no brainer to me And I agree putting something on a website is not the same a forcing them to tell the price straight up before people get too into the idea Maybe some people also suddenly realize that they have been paying way too much since there are much cheaper alternative Either way I do not see a down side for the consumer but of course big pharma wouldn t like that
RobinFlysHigh	All free market capitalist supporter are seizing
The PO From Hell	Uh for once I m with Orange Man s Admin on something Drugs need to be regulated
Just a Friend	Good god the side effect of these medication
Ryan Eyestone	This is a change that will allow for a better system and give ground for piece wise increase of government funded health care Because amongst the short term chaos of pharma insurance and healthcare provider the detail of what need stipend will be easier to articulate Easier to get both political side to agree Treating health care more like the need our agricultural industry ha rather than overly generalized writing of check making the rich richer due to behind closed door price control There is so little room for more manufacturer to compete due to the way regulation are set not around quality assurance a is claimed but to kill competition This change will give a foothold for smaller company to be born that help produce more expensive item Or med and vaccine that are in short supply I could set up a lab going beyond reasonable quality and safety need to make a single product at not much profit but still enough to get all involved paid well if not for the game being rigged to where the only 3 person drug manufacturer are meth lab
Jerms Mason	I love these morning video short and sweet a great way to start the day
Jessica McGee	I think this is an effort worth exploring Atleast the government is making an attempt I am not sure how effective this will be but I m glad were trying something
Jose C	How s the public backlash affected the pricing of EpiPen v what it wa before the big hike that brought this type of thing to the forefront
LifeLocks	I think if they did it it would be like political campaign in which company would be throwing punch all over saying “ our drug cost 10 le than our competitor ” and in turn this kind of le is more idea will lead to everyone lowering their price Simply because I think they ’ d rather sell any then not sell at all
Cayley Rae	I m a bit surprised the Trump administration is making this move considering a lot of the thing they ve done seems to put money before the people but this at least sound like it ll be a good change
ForeverOpenSkies	Interesting I don ’ t know that it will lower the cost of name brand drug but it may give a foot hold for person advertising off brand pharmaceutical Letting them show a 1 1 ratio on cost and it can help customer make sure that their healthcare is arguing sale for their benefit It ’ s interesting
Robert Grimaldi	As much a I hate Trump on a political and personal level I like the transparency he support on drug price etc
Alex Davies	I have to get these American med which make death only maybe permanent
Linn Boström	Now I am an outsider Mostly watching because I m curious of whats going on over there But I think if they are forced to list general price of the generic non brand alternative in the ad aswell then it could work But that can also break the company aswell
Austin Abro	Anything against big pharma is good in my book and I am not a fan of the trump adminstration
Darnis Art	Heh Shifting the conversation from should they be allowed to advertise to How about if they give you price tag Genius move
Mycosa at Long Night Entertainment	I will give credit where credit is due and say that I feel that this proposal is a good start I believe more need to be done and for me to fully support it I would require Mr Trump s resignation from presidency first a I am a never Trumper and genuinely refuse to back down on that key issue but I can agree with Congress supporting and moving forward with this kind of legislation
skysthe limitvideos	I usually don ’ t like the Trump administration but I have to give them credit where credit is due this is a great idea 👍🏻
Kurtis Walter	Oh man death may be permanent Don t tell me that
Lil Pixels	Doctor s have their staff call in or fax over your prescription We never know the price until the tech tell you your insurance won t cover the 300 00 item and that you could just get it over the counter for 9 00 Having this in place would change the guessing game of Do I have enough to cover this or Will my insurance cover this to Thank God there is a cheaper way
Lyall Crocker	I m an Aussie And we CAN say fuck pharma we won t coz money But we go to a doctor to have all that prescribed ALL drug are under that umbrella I m not saying you can t go get aspirin but that s mostly for a blood thinner and you get prescribed it a well Because that s what a doctor say you need If your doctor say you should take it then take it If you buy it off a shelf coz you think you need it then it s a thing I can t help you with I want to And I m always down for a random chat Having a vent is always fun
Steven A	I love the morning video
statespatrick	I d encourage you to speak to Congresswoman Diana Degette for further information on this topic
Kemar 2018	I like this new morning news
zether720	Oh my goodness Something Trump s administration did that actually affect me positively I m very impressed right now I hope this go through And this come from someone who isn t political in the slightest
Melak Khaleel	11 58 pm Tuesday in Australia haha LOVE THE MORNING SHOW
KFangirl4	Here ’ s something you might not have considered a different angle to this story Trump hate the “ fake news ” medium 80 90 of the commercial sold by the network nightly news are bought by big pharma to showcase medication The new price disclosure rule would apply to TV ad only Big Parma would stop buying TV ad buy more web ad skirt the rule and damage network news revenue at the same time forcing them to cut budget lay off staff and reduce coverage
Ovais Nadeem	a a college student i love catching up on news early in the morning
itsthosehour s	More consumer protection better Good job on this one trump admin
alex Debroux	I don t think people are taking more prescription drug because of these advertisement Psychoactive drug are on the rise everywhere I believe that people are simply becoming more mentally ill with every generation It s ridiculous to see how many close friend and fellow student are suffering from depression or severe anxiety My theory is that it ha something to do with all these relatively new technology like the internet and smartphones We re constantly connected and bombarded with information and our mind can t relax anymore I too wa diagnosed with panic disorder but eventually found peace in nature and meditation even though I wa skeptical at first Prescription drug should be your last resort and not just a way to ignore your problem
angelina santos	In CT my inhaler one for emergency and one to keep asthma at Bay all together cost 200 300
Gervasio Martins	Typical Trump say a good idea but then half ass it Nothing but hot air a always
EnderDragon	Trump may actually do something good for once
Jean G.	This isn t going to really do anything for me I don t really have a choice about what medication I take and even if I did I don t watch broadcast TV I highly doubt it will do anything to lower cost Part of the reason pharmaceutical company get away with fleecing people isn t that they don t know their medicine is absurdly expensive it s that they re faced with the reality of paying unfair price or not having medication for life threatening and or debilitating illness
Jeep Guy	Morning PhillyD Pog Champ
Inlanzer Gaming	I mean what is listing a price really going to do They need to start negotiating drug price My Aunt is pay 80 out of pocket for Blood pressure medication alone Trump and the administration is doing nothing to reduce the price of medical care whether it s pill or treatment
Mittens FastPaw	Still overpriced without insurance and advertised directly to people who do not need it causing problem
Shan Mathis	I still need healthcare 🤦🏾‍♀️
Thoughtfull Dane	I wonder how the Resistance will spin this xD
The Insane Nihilist	The morning video are a great addition to my morning
mr. Jack	Coma and death because these can be permanent no shit
John F Kenndy	Did that one ad say contact a doctor if in a coma or death BUT HOW THO
vivas555	Not american here but if the president really wanted to lower the price of drug he could easily do what other country are doing 1 Ban Ads for prescription drug 2 Have Pharmacy give by default the generic of a drug if available the patient Not consumer have to ask for a labeled drug 3 Put on government paid Ads asking people to trust their doctor Because in the US someone thinking he need pill can just keep seeking different doctor until one agreed even if it s not in his best interest But doing that will likely cut every penny the drug industry give the GOP so won t happen
Salpertia	This is nice and all You re totally getting there To the next stage
Moto Lumpy	Love waking up for class and having something to listen to while I get ready Fuck yeah Philly D
themikead99	Open up Pharma trade with Canada make new commission to review safety of imported drug Done No ridiculous rule for pharma industry required
SaucerJess	💙
Todd Dumond	jebus you up early phil
Todd C	This seems hugely confusing to patient They should just ban direct to consumer ad like uh every other country Wouldn t that lead to lower price
Ana Bermudez	If this becomes a thing price should be included under ALL platform not just on TV commercial Pricing for a 30 or 90 day script doe vary on many thing right now Which pharmacy someone go to Big Retail Chain Ma Pop Pharmacies Mail Order Pharmacy Insurance VS No Insurance discount card Manufacturer rebate that may be available IF a generic is an available alternative for the medication
Ayuta Neuron	I don t understand the concept of advertising drug It is either you need it or you don t if you are taking drug when you don t need it it can be quite harmful for your body these add are like googling your symptom only make you worry and want to ask for them
Devin	Thats fair the insurance doe pay alot of it for the most part so idk if this will work
Wajima	I doubt this will do much but almost any regulation on medical service is good IMO I ve met far too many doctor that seem to get off on how much they know about what s ailing you and not telling you jack shit Yeah i m sure it get boring repeating stuff that seems obvious to a professional but the pure narcissism i ve seen dripping from a few of them doesn t help The medical industry need trust and transparency more than any other because if we cant trust the people who are in charge of keeping u fucking alive well we re fucked
Kaged Creations	The medical industry all together need to be more transparent about pricing It ’ s the only industry which you have no idea what the cost will be until after the service is provided Call any hospital and try and even get an estimate on what the delivery of a baby would cost under normal circumstance you won ’ t get a straight answer you ’ d be lucky to even get a ballpark figure and they for sure won ’ t give you anything in writing
Bite Nicurague	America is getting better
Key M	I love the concept and I feel that putting the typical treatment price is a great idea but I could see them fudging that For instance if a course of a treatment is one lump but for result you need typically 2 dos they might not disclose that Love the idea tho 9 10 But to answer your question about lowering price probably not It s more about consumer empowerment n le ability for the populous to plead ignorance
Samuel Polay	It ’ s a lot harder for the government to negotiate price if it isn ’ t insuring more people
Jehu Roa	It will lower the price if pharma company doesn t conspire with the other
Kenny Schafer	That statistic is mind blowing They feed u garbage and then hook u on pill to keep u afloat long enough to drain u of our hard earned money A beneficial system for the pharmaceutical and food industry Not so much for the average American
ThatOldGuyPlayingCSGO	Well the trick question is this Why is the same drug sometimes 80 cheaper in Canada or Mexico
Mariposa Oscura	I am happy about this but the pharmaceutical company are only fighting this because they dont want to have to show the outrageous amount they charge for their medicine My father and brother both have diabetes some of there prescription are 500 750 a month and these medicine are on the cheaper end We are middle class family so trying to manage bill and pay for these medicine can be very stressful to say the least I feel this law would regulate some thing about pharmaceutical company but ultimately I dont know the answer but I wish something would be done about it a least there trying
Syndi Griner-Owens	I think people are smart enough to know that a listed price is before insurance I think the added transparency would be a good thing
MrMarowfreeze	This is probably the first thing the trump administration ha done that i wholeheartedly approve of I hope this move forward and that it will prevent future issue with price like what happened with EpiPen a few year ago
TeKaMOTO	How about You ban prescripiton drug ad and let your doctor find the correct medication for you instead of you self diagnosing and telling your doctor which drug you want
Mr. Morris	Dude Your left eye isn t awake yet These new AM show are appreciated but you might need to slow it down for a bit brother
Kayla O'Brien	I work in a pharmacy and I can say that out of pocket expense also depend on what pharmacy and sometimes state you re in There s no way that can correctly advertise a price of a drug against insurance out of pocket
Marty Herrick	Amazingly I think this is a fairly good idea I think more than anything this will push pharma onto more online ad but forcing competition of price mean thing like that as who upped HIV med might happen le
wortheffort	I ’ m disappointed you didn ’ t say anything even a sentence like “ pre election ” or timed introduction of “ idea ” This is far from law Timing wreaks of politics
Wendy Lea	How about we just rid of the ad Consumers should not be deciding which drug they should be taking because they don ’ t have the education in medicine Doctors should recommend drug and then have a discussion about the drug and price DOCTORS have the education to make medical decision and help their patient make medically informed decision PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES do NOT and they are only after your hard earned money They don ’ t care about you or what the drug could do to you or even if you actually need that drug Trust me I am chronically ill and on lot of medication I have the best doctor whom I trust completely and together we make medical decision for me I pay NO attention to those GREEDY drug pusher Drugs should have never been allowed to be made for profit Quit letting pharmaceutical company make decision for you Also insurance company should not be allowed to make medical decision for u They don ’ t have the right education and all they care about is Money not you
bob thornton	“ Coma or death a these thing may become permanent ” Really
Heather Miracle	I really appreciate this channel I love that I can educate myself on current event news without being forced to watch it on TV This get straight to the point And give opinion some not always match mine which open my mind I have been watching since 2010 I just love it Thanks for all you do Thanks to everyone on your team Thanks for everyone that can be on the Elite team and support the channel 😁
disk5464	Dinner PDS Breakfast morning show I like this very much
LeftRight	Beautiful bastard
Bros Firehawlk	Thank you Franko
AnzacKiwiAstrix	ah i thought t v ad where a dying thing well i see this a a look over hear just for TV ad hmm Being from NZ you may have ad for drug but anything that is behind a doctor note is normally subsidised and a cheaper one is offered with the government drug funding only drug i see pushed a lot are hay fever and cold and flue and you good old aspirin candy anyone and it 101 other for kid and for back pain now with all those vitamin
LanceAlam	Instead of having protection from big pharma why are Americans so dumb that they d use prescription drug in the first place
CGagnon5	Hello hello welcome to the morning show are you still trying to find an intro to this show
Groovy Shots Shots ect.	So they only have to advertise the cost on TV ad Last time I checked TV wa on it s death bed and most people consume their entertainment on the internet
hydro px	who need prescription drug i hear betterhelp is a wonderful place to seek help 😁💫
Ldygzlle	Only TV Not for magazine newspaper or anything you have to read That s got trump written all over it HA
Thomas Fisher	This is trying to fix a symptom not the real problem People don t care about the high cost of drug because insurance pay for a large portion of most drug We need better competition among insurance provider Competition in insurance would lead to those company bargaining for better price with pharmaceutical company to remain competitive That said I honestly don t think this will make drug price come down at all Research is extremely expensive and it is also how pharma company make money by creating new pill they can charge for Imagine if every flu shot add you saw said it cost 35 Do you think more or le people are going to get the flu shot I agree that it s an industry that need fixing but we need to start with insurance across the board since demand from insurance company is considerably more elastic than that of a normal consumer
Adolfo Patron	Like the graphic
Syk0tik	I a an American think that advertising for prescription drug is insane
Fister Twister	Good News for old people who still have cable while the rest of u will never know drug price
Max O'Neill	Don ’ t like the graphic you used for “ the big question ” It ’ s doesn ’ t fit your usual brand image it looked cheap and rushed
Maren	Here s my two sense on the matter It s a long read I am NOT a medical professional but have experience with prescription drug for mental illness While making drug more accessible could be considered a good thing I think we should be pushing other alternative For example I suffer from BPD and major depressive disorder which we ve found is drug resistant Because of this I m seeking TMS a type of brain stimulation therapy with the hope that either I ll learn to react to medication or not need it at all The only thing in my way is that it ha a fucking insane price tag Luckily my family s insurance cover it but only after I ve not only seen a therapist for a certain amount of time but if I have record of seeing 3 or more drug fail to work within my time of treatment and diagnosis All of that being said I am currently on a 225mg dose of Effexor which is over the therapeutic recommended dose This wa because my psychiatrist insisted my depression would react to the boost Low and behold it didn t and now I m just taking a pill for it s side effect which are weight gain lethargy and a handful of other goody If TMS wa made more accessible I could have seen some result way sooner than before I had to boost my medication I could go on and on about this TMS thing and about it s own side effect which are very few but that is not the point of this comment As a bit of a topical side track we are seeing an extreme crisis around opioids While there are some case that find a painkiller of that caliber necessary I honestly think we should be pushing more physical therapy type treatment to have a lower price tag if at all possible I have seen withdrawal effect first hand a I experience them every time I miss even a single day of my medication They are painful and usually last a couple day or week after the drug is reintroduced TLDR I just wish we d push other alternative treatment and avoid prescribing drug
QuiteDecent	Death may become permanent
Jared Burk	I don t see why this is a bad thing Medicine is a close to a monopoly a Disney is to owning the movie industry
Notmynews	This ha nothing to do if you support the left or right Support a good thing
Elizabeth Barton	I think it s a good idea I ve always thought it wa weird that pharmaceutical commercial never had pricing And they can put a disclaimer that the price may be different depending on your insurance and place the most commonly bought for price of the drug I hate not even having much of an idea about how much my med will cost until I get to the pharmacy and then have to decide if I can afford them or have to call my Doctor to change them to something else
Bmess55	Honestly great move by Trump completely unexpected and great for the consumer
DoitDoug	I ve been dead lot of time Its not permanent They re just trying to scare you I LOVE MORNING VIDEOS
Thinxo	Just remove copyright law for prescription drug or open trade to other neighboring country
Weaboo Jones	I m all for this but that s not to say it s a perfect bill I am worried that people might be confused about the drug and it price since the people might have insurance Any one got an answer
lol Maya	Okay but the price showed on tv will give them a general idea I think that most people would have enough sense to understand that insurance plan vary so not everyone s price will be the same Secondly if a doctor prescribes a a medicine that a patient need the patient knowing in the price in advance of this prescription probably won t sway their choice of whether or not they decide to take it Js
theskiesthelimit2	As an american I think it s ridiculous that drug company expect me to have a conversation with my doctor about drug I think I need Americans just want a pill for everything that ail them I think that having drug price on commercial will at least make a few people go wow I cant buy that drug every month Maybe I should check other drug I dont believe it will immediately cause a decrease in drug price but if enough people start to buy cheaper comparison then big pharma might not have a choice but to lower their price But at the end of the day this is America and big pharma will always get their way
Alexandria Centric	This is why more people should smoke eat marijuana for their ache and pain Those side effect go from death ect to sitting on the couch watching Phillip Defranco Wake up sheeple
timeholesandmonsters	Massive
de pinda show	check if the playback speed is on normal
Neezy Ko	70 of American s have at least 1 prescription I call BS on that number the only people I know that have prescription are over 60 year old I don t know anyone else among my friend and family that need a prescription Sure there are alot of people that need prescription but why the need to inflate the figure
FirstEyeBlind	Loving the morning video Philip Keep being awesome and working hard to keep people informed
JustCallMeKeebler	How about we just stop allowing drug company to advertise They already send our rep to doctor office trying to get the doctor to recommend their drug Why should we see an ad for a drug right after a Pepsi commercial and just before a car commercial I m a chronic pain patient who moved to the DC area almost 4 year ago Before I moved I wa on several different medication for pain and anxiety I stopped all med when I moved up here and I feel so much better My pain isn t nearly a bad a it wa my anxiety ha settled and I just feel so much healthier without those chemical in my body If the drug company don t want to do small simple change like listing their price in their ad take away their ad
Steve Oswald	I m impressed Trump is behind this one Regardless of whether price go down or not up front worst case pricing is highly beneficial to everyone
Becky B	I m ok with this cuz I always ask for the least expensive and they still try to slip me the most expensive drug
TAC	This might be the first thing I m kind of siding with Trump on Never really like those commercial I feel like most of the time they re fake I m very surprised in his approach and surprised he cared about this topic He never campaign about getting those damn prescription company in line
Curtis Dolan	Its thing like this that make me glad i live in the uk Don t get me wrong we have our problem but a prescription is a base price of around £9 per drug Doesn t matter what drug it is it the same charge and if your e getting multiple one 1 drug it still only the one charge If you have a child under 18 then your e tax exempt or if you claim certain benefit then you don t have to pay
xxxCrackerJack501xxx	I hate those drug commercial SO much but I can t quite place why they all just have this annoyingly fake upbeat and artsy yet cheap feel and tone to them with that same generic sounding garbage music and afterschool special PSA acting There must be just one production company that film them all
Curse_Z34	This is the first step towards more affordable healthcare You cant put a price on life Capitalism and healthcare shouldn t mix
CChissel	They need to crack down on the antipsychotic prescription giving people these drug for non psychotic ailment is a wide spread problem Even given to people with a psychosis is no guarantee a most become ineffective or worsen symptom and degrade quality of life extensively To make matter worse they will change an inactive ingredient and rebrand it Eli Lilly is one such company guilty of this since the 70 80
AYNSLEY STOREY	Hi People Great news Its about time the people were made aware of the cost of their med a for bringing down price it will eventually when people realise that they are over paying on one brand and they can get it cheaper by buying a different brand the company will have to drop their price to compete with each other it a win in my eye However this is being done by Donald Trump s administration so It ll be an evil Master plan
jancarlos490	coma or death a these may become permanent is there a way for death not to be
YuukitheMighty1	I fucking hate Trump and his administration but I do think this is a step in the right direction Big pharma company need to be held accountable
J Barr	It is batshit insane that drug company can advertize directly to consumer in the US
pixiedust429	Loved the length of the video To the point and covering all important information
droidclone	What you need to make one note in change this isn t a law This is a regulation Anything done by the administration that doe not go through Congress is a regulation This can be changed by the next drug are and or by the next president of the USA That s for big Pharma and their advertising I ve always thought it funny that you re not allowed to advertise to child but that s exactly the way these commercial or written acted out and posted a if Frolic in The Meadows by adult is what everybody s looking to do A happy pill for everyone
unorthadox hooligan	1 07 did she say death MIGHT be permanent
7858salvador	This is kinda crazy cause I always thought these guy control the world or do a lot of dirty behind the scene stuff
Panda Beats	Why would the company be required to display their price only in tv ad Thats stupid to limit their responsibility to one medium outlet
BluntforceJ	big pharma care about you and doesn t want you to be confused s
Kevin England	Love the morning show Phil 😊
Jabo's Fun Train	great vid wish the best for my american peep
Lisa Escobar	I loved this morning show I normally save the evening video for the next morning I just prefer to watch news in the morning so i feel prepared for the day with conversation topic
Reasonable Discourse	As someone in the EU the Morning video are awesome timing wise Also the content is A just like the PDS
Puerto Rico Plays	If we had a morning show everyday you wouldn t catch me complaining 😏
April Rogers-Krick	As the mother of child with Type 1 Diabetes which is a nonpreventable autoimmune disease and ha no cure I would give anything for Insulin and supply to be cheaper We are lucky to have very good private insurance But if we did not I do not know how I would keep my child alive The monthly cost of insulin alone is 5000 then add test strip syrinx bee sting needle ect The cost is around 7000 I am not a supporter of the Trump admin so yes this surprise me
Cornwall1888	Glad I ’ m Scottish government funded healthcare and prescription 😁 America need to catch up to everyone else
tsnorquist	Not sure why everyone seems surprised Trump had this down a a directive at the beginning of the year He s delivering on what he campaigned on
Johnathan Dix	I think it s funny that pharmaceutical company are more concerned that listing price on ad is more damaging than having to explain that anal seepage is a potential side effect of their drug
supercalafragilisticjoy	One of the very very very very few thing that I agreed with Trump about when he wa running wa about the boosting drug competition and drug pricing negotiation US healthcare system is an absolute joke to the rest of the world Pay more for le That s smart
Adam Fox	Incentives to lower their price I d be watching that if i wa you To me that read a the government is going to pay subsidy to the pharma industry which will just mean you ll still end up paying the same price but you ll be paying it in your tax instead
Ben H	Great job with the editing and styling of this short video make all of this information quite easy to follow a Phil talk kinda quickly
Shallotte	I think this is meant to make it so drug company can t discreetly inflate the price while knowing the average person won t notice Drug company are super greedy and I don t have much sympathy for them I m sure the official pushing for this feel the same way It s likely that running a pharmaceutical corporation made him feel bitter and he ended up applying for government and shut his mouth until he wa in such a position of power that he could force a change Which if true is pretty admirable
Jonathan Song	he didn ’ t start the video with “ what ’ s up you beautiful bastard ” wtf
Hu-Ellen Steele	I love your morning video It s nice to wake up and watch a I get ready for work
Jeffrey Hogan	Lol it made me laugh when you were Speaking about whether or not this would actually work to lower price of prescription drug you referenced someone who said they are not sure Welp that get me nowhere lol
Nina369ish	I m not exactly sure how much this will really changed anything I know for myself whatever drug I get is decided by who ha a deal with my insurance For example I kept having to call for 3 4 week straight to get humalog instead of novolog because my insurance decided to make a deal with novolog mind you I ve tried novolog and it doesn t work for me It took me 2 month to get the medicine lucky for me the doctor felt horrible and gave me sample of humalog and I ll love them forever for that Anyways my point being if they did list price in the end it s the insurance s choice who they want to buy from
Quartz Cairn	Work in the pharmacy and in a side of town where a lot of people don t have money I ve come to discover most doctor don t have any regard for cost They only get pen and gift from drug manufacture in a roundabout way The least this could do is educate the people without insurance especially on med without generic And even people with insurance there could be note added to the bottom of script It happens with cream or eye drop They ll state that if x item is expensive then use y I think that this is a good thing
red 19	Wait hold up pump the brake 1 did this dude say 5000 dollar drug 2 What drug cost 5k and whyyyy do u know how many thing u can do with 5k
Charlie Bradley	Requirement should be expanded beyond the TV Especially the internet
Thicc Spidey	Oh wow
Google it	Wait Trump is actually doing something to fight against drug company Is Is that right
Tyler Loftin	“ Welcome to the morning show ” I like the sound of this Would love to wake up to a morning PDS too someday
Erin Davison	Many Americans don ’ t have Rx drug coverage or they have ridiculously high deductible catestrophic insurance or high deductible HSA plan they have to meet before their drug copays are covered Listing the full retail price is important Insurance is screwy My insurance is amazing but I got a letter from them saying they do not cover generic ephineprine auto injector But they will cover epipen name brand So then I have to weigh the cost of buying the generic one out of pocket v my drug copay for the name brand My grandmother ha a “ grey area ” in coverage once she hit a certain amount Then she ha to pay 2000 to hit her max out of pocket before her Medicare part D plan pick up paying again Price transparency in the medical industry will only help everyday Americans
Ljusskygg66	Its already law in my country and pharmacy is by law obligaded to change to the cheapest varity of the medicine if there is more than one so you always get the best price
Matt Johnston	As a Canadian I find it bizarre watching American television and seeing drug ad on TV It s like fucking candy it seems shady in the first place that these company that already seemingly own most of the country are allowed to advertise the way they do
Ely Loew 2040	Is most developed country pharma company can t advertise prescription drug because the idea is that doctor prescribe what is best for the patient which unfortunately isn t always true But I m all for more transparency on all pricing in the healthcare world
Danyel Rash-Sawyer	Big pharma have no idea what is like to go and get your prescription just to just to see that you can t afford it Not being able to get what you need until you scrounge up enough money to get your medicine The reason that they are so against simply adding the price to ad is because they want full control of pricing They raise and lower price on a whim It s like getting pick pocketed in Skyrim
The Diamond Invader	Seems like a good idea to me a long a it is the price before insurance then when you actually buy it if you have insurance then the price will be lower
Katrina L	Ads for prescription drug Holy molly the US is a twisted country
Ricky Spanish	This seems like a good thing
RAY	I have always found it odd that we have pharmaceutical commercial here in America I ’ ll trust my doctor to give me the right medication based on his her experience and education not an ad on TV
Paladin585	Kind of a misunderstood thing about the side effect they re generally either rare or not threatening to the health of the individual They have to list every little thing that go wrong in testing even if it turn out to be an isolated incident
therock343	Uggh this is gon na get lost among the comment because it praise Trump I m a liberal this is a good step forward BUT that said We need to look at other first world country when it come to their healthcare system The bottom line is our healthcare medical debt is astronomical compared to other first world country One criticism Why are you only playing to only one isle of the political spectrum Defranco ha never made a video on a policy like Medicare 4 all or just skimmed by it Talk about Universal healthcare He made a whole video on this policy Call Phillip out on this blatant biased
Mr. Noob jr	He is spitting fire rhyme at the beginning
jcletsplay	I m not surprised This is a move that make sense for the Republican Party It look a though it is a move that stick it to big pharma However since there is no real enforcement or punishment nothing really change As it stand right now it is mostly a smokescreen and one that will generally be well received by the public
TheD†uned	Trump punishing big pharma for funding Hillary Clinton
Velocesreptile	I think giving drug company the ability to show competitor s price on the ad will lead to lower price especially if most consumer are aware of this If i wa watching an ad for a drug and saw no listing of the competitor s price then i would rightfully assume that the competitor would be selling it at a lower price So if consumer think like this company will end up lowering their price below competitor s so they can say hey look we are cheaper use our drug I dont think that putting them on a list to be shamed would have any impact on drug pricing a i really dont think company will care nor will consumer
Owlopusrex	Radical idea Stop over prescribing drug
Russell Holland	As cool a fighting pricing for big pharma is the timing of it make it seem like hey we re trying to lower cost of med but we cant because of the dems fighting u on this Sorry murica Maybe you should have voted red in the mid term
MrJ moto	On the topic of the drug company s argument is total bullshit I dont think I have never met anyone that Contact their insurance to make sure that they cover The drug in question and how much they cover the cost simply one phone call or the counter with tell you I think it should be law that they should tell you what a drug would cost with or without insurance because my insurance some drug cost more out of my pocket so I make sure I know both price
M P	Jsyk I went into labor last night watching yesterday ’ s video and a of about 3 49am I have my second son
Dawson Laramie	I like what Trump is trying to do honestly but I m not smart enough to know all the repercussion it may have lol
Florian Studer	laugh in free healthcare
Jon Carlo Soriano	Well while it might not lower the price of med atleast u consumera can get a general picture how much we would need to pay to get one
Tampatec	💊 I asked a Pharmacist how can you sleep at night charging sick customer thousand for med He said sleeping is easy with Expensive bed and pillow
Mike Shilts	I love Pharma s response because it show why this is necessary A patient s relationship with their in co is THIER relationship not Pharma s The price is the price regardless Pharma is fine charging a lot money because a 3rd party pay most of it and the patient think it s cheap which impact premium deductible and coverage long term Make them show u the number Justify the revenue stream
eyesanew	The price of a medication doe change depending on what insurance you have These company can list the different price for their medication on the commercial However this would not just expose them but also expose the insurance company I don t mean expose like they are terrible evil company more exposure will lead to more competition will offer better benefit for consumer
Mellow Melee	Drugs do not follow the basic rule of supply and demand If you need a drug for pain relief addiction or to stay alive the price usually ha minimal impact on the decision to purchase
tenten32158	if drug company are so worried about how expensive their drug will seem when putting the price on a tv ad it s really simple List an average or lowest possible price that consumer will pay directly after insurance kick in along with the actual price of the drug Like I dunno Drug Price 300 but your co pay could be 20 10 or even 0
wurzyking	Obviously the best option is just not have Pharmaceutical commercial at all and have you doctor make the decision about what is best for you and the possible option This seems like it may affect how likely a person will request a specific drug based on an ad Of course this could dissuade people if the price is too much but it could swing the other way if that product is cheaper than what they already have This could be a good thing and drive drug competition and drive price even further down However this are major drug we are talking about this isn t checking the difference in price between zyrtec and allegra The cheaper option could also be more dangerous i remember an ad for birth control that popped up on almost every commercial break and a year later ad for lawsuit against this drug for family member that died Yaz i think it wa called Yes cheaper prescription drug is overall a fantastic thing but the most important thing is to listen to your doctor about the best option available to you and trust his her 12 year of college and training
Matthew Barr	I really liked the editing in this video It d be cool to see all the video edited like this
7orqu3	Nobody doe a fake worried face better than Phillip The Fence Sitter Defranco
Adrian Maxwell	Wow I m not mad at Trump for once okay I m mad at him but not about this specific thing Even if this doesn t shame company into lowing their price it s nice to have that added information Most of the time when I see a pharmaceutical ad I dismiss it it s just another drug ad stating the usual stuff trying to seem enticing while listing a long slew of side effect Including a price may make me pay attention As someone who struggle financially if I see an ad for an antidepressant and it pop up that it s a monthly price lower than what I wa expecting I may be more inclined to try to get that If they re concerned about confusion because of insurance then give a basic number a patient may pay if their insurance won t cover it then a disclaimer 30 for a month supply may be lower depending on your insurance company It s not that complicated I do think it should extend to other platform a well fewer people are watching TV and by social medium I don t know if they mean social medium commercial like the one they play on YouTube or on break on thing like Hulu or if those are covered by the tv ad requirement It s so hard to get better and be informed about medication despite in a day and age where we have such big scientific advancement and so much information at our fingertip The easier we get the information the better
MrApp Bee	Love the extra video
Mahatma Kane Jeeves	How will the leftist make this about race I wonder🤔
KrunoKing	It seems very strange to advertise prescription drug Isn t a prescription drug given to you by your doctor who should know which drug is best for you considering their medical knowledge and them having your medical information also since it s US and health is not affordable they consider your budget
TsMHicks	Super glad this ha the potential of happening Mark another thing good Trump is doing Ridicule him for thing he doesnt show result on praise him when good stuff like this happens I hope we slowly revamp reboot the pharma industry imho Too many people addicted to prescription drug maybe showing them how much it ll cost them wise will get them to not even take them Yes there are medicine that do help and those people will buy them regardless but most are to get you to take other med and continue a never ending cycle If you impact a person wallet or benefit thats where u will get the most resistance Hoping this happens and we see price fall or people stop taking a many med a it affect their income margin
Glenn Rickard	Thanks Trump 3
Miracle Mark	I ’ m not gon na lie I can ’ t watch one of your video anymore without thinking of a Better Help joke
David Doty	I like this Thank you
supersmashbro5031	The way I see it this could go one of two distinct way in my opinion One way being it could bolster the company resolve and a a result they stand their ground for the quality of their product being a key factor in keeping their price in the same semi transparent state that the industry ha garnered over the year The only problem to this being the actual longevity of their stance and if they decide to artificially restrict access to much needed medicine to the general public creating national headline at the least detrimental to the most detrimental being a public outcry which is denied by an absurdly difficult pay wall to overcome a more and more pharmaceutical are developed to combat more and more disease and disorder This creating an artificial mean of hyper inflated price which would fall down a slippery slope of general inaccessibility to anything that isn t OTC Another way being if they became completely transparent with pricing option to the general public This could result in more general awareness of what you re getting but it could create a gray area of over accessibility This could result in a lot more people being prescribed substance that have a threat of developing a dependency being subject to a misdiagnosis or an overdose of yet another easily accessible substance due to people seeing what they re getting and going through the process to get it in any way they legally can Another bump in the road is to factor in thing like AARP Medical Coverage or even the concept of having medical insurance to begin with These institution do the research on price point and even offer discount based upon their unique tier system Some would argue that this method offer a safer alternative to accessing medicine that could prolong or save your life but at the cost of a higher premium for using their service It could hypothetically render most of those job opportunity obsolete and give that responsibility to the general public who is generally uninformed of most option that they have at their disposal In short there s an unintended yet foreseeable consequence to either standpoint My opinion create a regulated system of obtaining and researching different medication through either an organized effort like a website that can only be accessed through ID number given to you from your chart at the doctor s office or create an equally regulated system of cycling name brand medicine that have only recently been developed with other brand that have garnered consistent result into an accessible OTC form The newer one are only accessible through prescription at a medical facility and the reliable older one are cycled to the public at an accessible price point that is not only visible but comparable to promote healthy yet regulated competition
Mumen Rider	Think of this tactic a a way to get more money dumped into the election cycle a lot of hype and noise now but once the money roll in this proposal will die
shmebulock	Maybe unpopular opinion but hear me out I think it ’ s important to remember that the blueprint at 1 44 said create incentive to lower list drug price While I agree that some medication are exorbitantly priced it ’ s also true that pharmaceutical company will only continue to innovate and research if they can recover their money and fund future product Marketing is a powerful tool and if too many new drug fail to get off the ground because of their perceived high initial cost we could be in big trouble Getting any drug through the drug testing process cost hundred of million if not billion per drug And that doe not include all the investment made on formula that failed out of the testing process part way through If a patient see an ad for an expensive new drug they may be deterred and not listen to their doctor when they say the old cheaper drug is le effective ha le side effect etc opting to continue with an older cheaper drug This situation could easily turn into consumer sticking with tried and true drug ignoring new product and bankrupting company that spent billion on drug research Why would pharma company risk making new drug when they can just market their old drug that have made back their investment and increase profit margin I ’ m not saying consumer should not be informed how much a drug is going to cost them but it is a bit naive to think a patient who see a commercial for an old drug being sold for 50 a month will switch to a new more effective drug that cost 200 a month just because their doctor recommend them too Maybe if the government subsidizes some of the research cost or fund more research itself drug company can comfortably lower price during their patent period All I ’ m trying to say is there need to be more that is done this can ’ t be the only way we try to pressure pharma company because we may not like how they decide to push back at u
onepunch saitama	I imagine that the pharmaceutical lobbyist hyped up on caffeine ready to fight this while Trump is just smiling over steak and egg
N Brown	Outlaw prescription drug ad on tv Many good pill many crap pill a tv commercial is not the way to pick a prescription drug
Gravity Gas	Nice morning video but I m too busy paying attention to the editing to see if I can find out you guy new workflow The video doe seem a smidge off I guess but the only thing I can really put my finger on is that there s le cut to Phil and maybe le transition I mean it s not bad don t get me wrong but it doesn t feel normal and kinda different and I m just trying to be a big brain boi and figure it out but I m not editing guru either Again nice video
Arrieta 187	Wow you guy are barely catching up on this Did msnbc and cnn not inform you The Trump administration announced this like 3 week ago
Chev Campbell	Insurance a a standard shouldn t be involved in perscription drug Your car insurance doesn t pay for your oil change If you want perscription coverage get a perscription plan or coupon It would be like buying a service plan from you car dealer Then there could be a competitive market
Leon Chen	I don ’ t really like Trump but i love this idea Im in
Michael Rodriguez	I ’ m an independent here and I don ’ t agree with this move While yes it is good in theory to advertise the price the actual price of prescription is extremely high without insurance and it will lead to a lot of confusion for consumer This could then lead to possible argument of false advertising if proper legal text isn ’ t worded properly I love the idea of lowering prescription price but I don ’ t think this move will change that
SpIdAgRaY	Why doe this video look like a power point presentation put together by a high school student for their class Something about the editing is off
Dularr	Why is this a surprise You may not like President Trump But he is delivering on almost everything he promised He talked about lower prescription pricing a part of his America first policy That it wa unfair that America paid more for prescription drug than other country
Luis Duarte	Kudos to trump for doing something good for consumer
Melissa Georges	call your doctor if you experience or death because these may become permanent
G-man	american are fucked in every way possible
mecenary1337	I ’ m digging the morning show
Drivetime Josh	What is the name of the big pharma lobbiest
Chronically Chelsey	As a disabled patient that is a former pharmacy technician this is interesting to say the least First let me say that I am not against this at all Second all of this information is already available Patients have a responsibility to educate themselves further on every single drug they are interested in prescribed already or have been taking for some time This includes side effect price alternative Your doctor should know this info if they are worth anything your pharmacy is more than willing to discus it And if either of those is untrue I reccomend a pharmacy linked to a hospital or clinic instead of a big chain this likewise link your doctor directly to your pharmacy staff I dont know I can t help but see this a just pandering to the public
Bo Simmons	I think this is good because you don ’ t know how much you ’ re paying until you ’ re picking up you prescription and then you ’ ve waited to pick it up and you have already seen your doctor
Aurora Quinn	Not a fan of Trump personally but if he can get this signed and passed he may have my vote
val see	Theatre Nothing but show Omg pricing on tv ad Quickly refers to viewership number of tv v online ad

laciee	I thought death wa only temporary and that you would respawn a couple of second after you died I ve been lied to
Dontlie Tome	Accountability to the drug industry Gon na be alot of resistance from those in the pocket of big farma
Uncle Gamer	I think we should outlaw all prescription drug advertising They are sending message about drug to people that often have no meaningful knowledge of health care to understand the drug usage Also the money used for the advertising could be used for more research or even to lower the price of the drug in question
khaled Hichmad	The Pharmaceutical company lobbiests are slacking start writing them check boy Damn America is fascinating
G0DM0NSTER	I am extremely surprised due to how much of a shit human being Trump is this could be good for the future I wa worried this short wa going to be about maybe me losing my Medicaid coverage and not getting my Bipolar and Health medication My parent said they would always make sure I have my med but I just don t want them to pay so much y know Hopefully it help instead of hurt cause I have always wanted to start a project that would help people get the med they need for super cheap or free and let them lead happier life due to the medication they would be on
fuaad Mohamoud	Thanks Trump
Innermix	I think overall it s a good thing when transparency is a part of the equation but a someone who is visually impaired just having it written on a screen is not going to help me make an informed decision I think it should be spoken aloud somewhere in the ad and because their concern is different people will pay different price based on their insurance they should mention that in the ad to cover that concern
enveyorbust	american health care make no sense i take 7 pill a day thats 7 box a month t cost me £30 a quarter or £10 a mointh if thats eiser in america i wouldnt be able to afford there inflated price
Keoki johnson	Some actual good mew Sounds great to me
Electric Fangs	CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE DEATH
MommyOfMutants	If the drug company are worried about having the price in the ad making people thinking the price are too high compared to what the patient would actually pay out of pocket after insurance coverage couldn ’ t they after listing the price have a disclaimer like “ Please be advised that this price may vary be lower depending on your individual insurance coverage For more information please discus this with your dr your insurance provider or go to website ”
B V	Honestly I m shocked to be writing this but this administration is trying to do something beneficial I m for it Though realistically I would force them to say the price too a it need to be accessible for the visually impaired and I would force it on all other advert too not just TV The reason social medium is abused is because people can write what they want and those not wishing to look further into claim will just accept what is said However I gulp commend them on the first step to destroying this consumer lead medical frenzy This idea that it would stop someone getting the right treatment is totally false all other developed country have managed with the doctor deciding what is good for people It work because it s on their head if they get it wrong They have trained for so many year in not only how to keep people healthy but also understanding what drug really do and how they are produced They are expert not just people accepting that what the nice lady or man making money from me on the TV said sound good for me
DeWayne Lehman	Yay the morning show is back I loved it when you first brought it out keep it going Use your other cast if it s too much for you Phil but 2 show is great

Isaac Gruver	If this is a violation of freedom of speech then so is the requirement to put a nutrition label on food The government isn t trying to mandate what you can and can t say it s trying to give the consumer what they need to know about a drug

Raymond Kapala	I love the disclaimer at 1 08 Thanks drug company didn t know death wa permanent
toqe	i visited usa few month back and those ad made me laugh 80 of those ad are just side effect and warning
Teresa Sández	I don´t know if this would work but it seems like a good thing to do right America ha a big problem with public health and the FDA In Spain most drug are free or really cheap if they´re including in a prescription and a doctor gave it to you So only unnecessary drug are expensive It work very well but also we have a good health system so idk
Oonagh72	No one watch tv anymore so excluding it from social medium which is where people research drug is a gift to the drug company
Hector Perez	Liked it
The [REDACTED] Guy	I think drug ad are both odd and creepy I also think that drug ad should not be a thing but that s something I don t feel too strongly about
Quinn Reed	Always found the American drug ad soooo creepy
Cheybat	I mean an actual positive development would be banning these advertisement all together like the rest of the world
LordOwlBear	These sort of tactic are commonplace direct the conversation somewhere else a to distract them from what we really want and what the conversation should be about Universal Healthcare
TheCintnoti	I m willing to bet that if the pharmaceutical company opposed it then it s likely to loose them money Maybe by forcing them to engage in price competition or maybe because consumer will be dissuaded from asking about expensive drug Pharmaceutical company are business and business exist to generate revenue All that really matter is that direct to consumer advertising for pharmaceutical is fucking weird
Lynn Rolaf	Great first step The lawyer sound like Big Tobacco screaming about first ammendment right But still a great step it reeling in Big Pharma
Truck Driver 101	Coma or death may become permanent 😂
Michael Stone	How about a simple disclaimer the listed price are not definite Speak to your doctor insurance on how the price may change Cause even if this get turned into law they ll always be some loophole or some clause to get by
PlaygroundPrincess	Oh my god you talk so fast for my morning brain
Shaun Westling	Pharma argues they shouldn t advertise the cost because consumer won t be paying it Meanwhile healthcare cost is crushing our society and is still rising along with our insurance premium of course they want the consumer to only consider their out of pocket cost and not consider the total cost to the care system that is hidden inside their premium Meanwhile insurance provider and employer are moving to high deductable healthcare plan where the cost transparency is an important factor a plan participant must make more direct difficult decision of cost v health
GG RELOADED	I don t know which is worse prescription drug or BetterHelp
Silent Mobius	Uh oh the Trump administration is trying to keep another promise wonder how many head are gon na explode if he succeeds on another one
Will Lastnameguy	How much you wan na bet the leftist freak out about this
Adel Wolf	Am I the only one who is dubious about this Yes this would be great for the people who actually watched television Will this cover streaming TV a well Excluding print and web advertising leaf out a significant demographic of people who would be well served by this information Just using myself a an example I take several prescription one that without the manufacturer s 1 year assistance program cost over 900 a month I wouldn t have known that even if they were starting to plaster it all over TV commercial And lem me tell you the sticker shock you face when you re at the counter and they re ringing you up and you find out that the med is so new that your insurance doesn t cover it
Nova Kobra	it s about time someone doe something about big pharma in the US it s growing a nation of addict and poverty They will prob win this fight might have something to do with hundred of BILLIONS of dollar a well a powerful politician in their back pocket THis is what Trump should be doing going and and sorting these criminal out Wait a day or 2 though to see the leftist spin on this to make Trump literal Hitler
TheLightningScience	It s a half step in the right direction
Fragtastic	Things I noticed 1 This wa a little mini episode 2 You re using graphic like the 8 o clock news now 3 Drug company will price you to death and expect the government to pick up the tab
Peter Wysoczanski	it a big we will see but I think a a first step to actually try and make a change that no one s been capable of it a good one also ha this been tried before in other field what didn t we see pricing for at one time that we do today
beccathebadger	honestly i really hate trump but over this yes completely should have medical transparency it so important and even though he a bankrupt failure he still seen a a business man and might have more sway The drug industry need tackling let see if this could be a start to it
lopu	YES GOOD VID
thehALomolov2	So only the USA and new Zealand have direct to consumer advertising I m in Canada we have it too Idk if it s on USA channel but they re definitely not being replaced with allowed ad Our provider and network would probably replace them if they were being fined for breaking the law
Riley Findley	i m really anti Trump but this seems like a good bill
Gerald Miller	Thanks Trump
peter peet	So company have a 1st ammendment Interesting
emma de banville	Hey Phil are you goign to talk about what the trump administration is thinking of doing in regard to trangender people They want to determine gender more narrowly tostrictly the sex at birth which would just take away so much from what the trans community ha managed to earn in regard to right in the last decade I know it s not a set thing yet but it could be a very damaging thing to so many people
Kingjay814	Hey I work in this industry on the insurance side of thing Okay so I personally feel like this is a good idea I remember reading about this a few month back for the first time and provided there isn t any hidden evil shit buried in this thing somewhere I m all for it These ad are targeted towards elderly people who are generally in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan These cost are a big deal because sure they may have a copay most of these plan have a limit The donut hole is pretty much all on the patient to meet That s when this cost would come into play because depending on the plan the member may be responsible to pay for the ENTIRE RETAIL COST Now for younger folk Small company who have to offer coverage probably have a really shitty plan With those plan it s not uncommon to have a deductible on your prescription coverage and then the plan will only cover a percentage 80 of 3 000 is still a metric crap ton for people starting off A lot of people thing hospital are where the big expense are and that s not true nowadays This is a good thing The argument that these company are using is utter bull shit Violation of the First Amendment WTF get out of here
Kristina Knapp	I think that this is a good idea even if it they put up a chart of different insurance with base price Let the public know that price can fluctuate depending on your specific insurance I m chronically ill and I take an average of 20 pill a day with almost 10 different medication that make up those pill These prescription pill help make it possible to get out of bed but I can t tell you how many time my insurance denies a medication for me because of price also I have medicaid so if it this difficult for me imagine other people with different insurance So whether this might help drug company lower the price or if it make it possible for more generic drug to be made I m all for it
Rae	Pricing transparency is necessary in pharmaceutical Whether the price drop seems irrelevant It also doesn ’ t matter to me if different insurer cover different amount for the same drug The cost risk is spread out across all participant We all pay for it one way or another We should know the price
Chewyshoot	Can we talk about your involvement in the Better Help scam
Patterrz	Whenever i d travel to the US i d see these drug advert and think they were the strangest thing ever

Andrew Johnson	The administration could suggest whatever legislation they want but BigPharma ha most of Congress by the ball This will never happen
Charlie St. Niklaus	I love morning show
Boba Fett	I object to any of these change orangemanbad
Dutchie's Room	I think this is definitely a good thing but it would need to extend to the internet to have a lasting effect Television is dying out and the internet is only growing from this point on so it would only make sense to be transparent on both platform
prairiepanda	Prescription drug should be prescribed based on the judgement of a specialist not on how influenced a patient is by advertising
Jess C.	Do do I actually agree with something the Trump administration is doing
Lauren Moore	First off loved this morning video Secondly I think this is a great idea I m not sure if it will drive down price but I feel like it is important to be upfront with customer Also people who need prescription tend to know that the cost will be lower than the list price with insurance and discount offered by the company Furthermore the company could easily state this is the ad Honestly I m against direct to consumer ad for pharmaceutical company but this is such a great step forward
Im Smarter Than You	Big Pharma is about to get Trumped Make America Great Again
Colleen Aitken	I m just surprised trump is ACTUALLY doing what he said he wa going to do

Hakuna Matata	The Trump Administration Doing something bad for business And good for the american people Whaaaaaat
Noah Price	I ve been on a medication for three year that cost me 7 a month right now but without insurance it could cost me over 600 the actual list price doesn t really matter unless you don t have insurance I probably would have turned down a medication that ha drastically improved my life if I had known the pre insurance cost
TenebrousFilms	That wasn t where my mind went when I saw American Patients FIRST
doug dimmiedab	Wow the trump administration might do some good weird
CapturingMedia	Like Trump or not at least on this it seems he is trying I cant fault that But I am sure Politicians will try to spin this
Dominic Campbell	Not a fan of the Donald but I ll give him prop when it s due
Sassafras & Lemons	Most of my prescription are generic but one isn t Because it isn t even made in generic form I have to pay 75 for a one month supply It is something that I must take to prevent the clot in my arm from moving to my heart brain or lung I have friend who must take insulin or they will literally die But the cost of insulin is so high that even with insurance it is still ridiculously expensive I think this is a step in the right direction to get drug company to lower their price
HamanisaNomosaki	Morning show

Baz Z	Why are patient choosing their prescription drug Whats the point of having doctor and pharmacist
spring roll	YESSS GO AMERICA AHEAD OF THE GAME never thoguht I d support a trump policy surrounding healthcare but very happy to be surprised even Australia doesn t require transparency with pricing for drug company when panadol can charge 3x the price a regular paracetamol acetophen and still be the most common paracetamol we have a problem hopefully the rest of the world follows suit 3
voltage80x	Phil we need more video like this screw the YouTube drama Phil man to man We are too old for drama
Booker Dewitt	You could just solve the problem entirely by making it illegal to have these type of advertisement like most of the world ha already done a most Americans are already way over medicated but it s a start
broadwayindie	Who in the pharma industry pissed off the Trump administration
Daniel Derese	we love your face too
seed dren	You guy probably have no idea how beneficial this will be to me and my family
Healing Moon Tarot	I m glad action is starting but it s not enough I think advertising should stop This would cause the change we are looking for Advertising wa started to inform patient of option right We all have a phone in our pocket now Most of u are capable of finding info we are looking for We don t need it shoved down our throat
SofaKing Amazing	I don t feel these drug company should advertise at ALL Street drug dealer don t advertise or push their drug that hard on to consumer s and they are not going out of business Maybe the drug company could lower the price of the drug instead of paying million in advertising Just a thought I don t trust doctor or pharmaceutical
Eagle 367	I m surprised Drumpf admin is the one taking this step at least they are doing something which is nice for the Americans The previous admins didn t do anything of value Will this happen and will this be of value only time will tell but the government need to mandate price for a real change
MEALSONWHEELS	it a great premise and kudos to the Trump admin for trying to stick it to big Pharma but the drug company will just stop advertising unless it a cheap drug they ll just line doctor pocket with cash to prescribe their drug more often like they already do
Stephanie Carter	As a pharmacist I wholeheartedly disagree with public advertisement for prescription Patients don ’ t always know what ’ s best for their care and are often resistant to comply with generic medication that are recommended by their doctor because it “ wasn ’ t what they asked for ” until they get a 300 a month copay which requires the pharmacy to do a TON of background work to get it changed to a cheaper alternative So while I agree with adding pricing for transparency it will add to a lot of confusion Many brand name drug will list coupon price or will list wholesale pricing which are VERY different Which will then force pharmacy to give cheaper pricing mind you they ’ re only often making penny on the dollar to make customer happy when their copay doesn ’ t turn out to be what the ad said We need insurance regulation PDMs to make this transparency work in favor of the consumer not add to more confusion
TallWhiteCraker	I m glad to see sxephil presenting quality news I m tired of the celebrity drama and b
snodge and friends	In Australia it like 8 00
Saire	Most of the time the stupid ad are just some happy people smiling around a table and just say ask your doctor like wtf is it even for then I m for this change
Dean Flet	Thank you Phili D much appreciated and informative on the prescription drug ✌🐼🤳
Daisy P	i think that whether or not it help lower price people shouldn ’ t walk into the doctor not knowing what to talk about w any medication and that includes price the first thing i always ask my doctor pharmacist is if there ’ s a generic and if it cost le but i still don ’ t know how much thing cost to begin with there ’ s value in knowing that
Julia Chilcote	Love your face
The Curious Sapien	Insurance company who make back that 300 Billion a year only cover the cheapest generic version of these drug You can t get named brand medication on Medicaid or Medicare I think drug company should be forced to charge the same amount they charge other country and not price gouge which is supposed to be illegal in the USA but we all know that will never happen
Ellanion	Comment from outside of Capitalist dystopia Prescription drug advertised on TV is terrifying to begin with This is several level deep on wrong
reachthroughreality	why would you need to know the price of a medication when you speak to your doctor That really shouldn t be a factor You should only be on a medication if it is absolutely needed to maintain your quality of life and if there is no other alternative Pharmaceuticals especially maintenance drug medication taken regularly for extended period should be a finally volley But maybe drug and medication aren t actually interchangeable term and they re actually being honest and just selling u drug useless shit we don t actually need but may make the human condition that literally everyone ha to deal with a little easier Sure you could exercise and eat healthy but why bother with all that when you could just take this pill to flush all that naughty cholesterol away Life ha you down Instead of re examining your life choice changing your lifestyle and the people you surround yourself with just get really high and be a zombie I know some people actually do need this stuff and do have real problem and I m not trying to downplay that but I m convinced 75 of people on all these drug were just conned into thinking there wa something wrong with them and this magic bean wa the only way to fix it
freesamplethief argle	I think it a great idea Especially since older people being the drug target usually and also not having a damn computer
Toggan Reggif	I m actually very surprised that this might become a thing I m not mad at it I actually like the idea but I m very surprised it s coming from this Administration lol
Christopher Haddock	I love these
Eden Jeffrey	Don t even live in the US and watch Philly D We need a DeFranco clone for the UK
Taylor Larson	Lord I love the new Republican Party We stand for a fiscal responsibility then balloon the deficit We believe the free market will take care of pricing then creates a weird 1 2 measure for drug We hold strong to our Christian value then we make sure that those in need can t afford healthcare or turn away people asking for help Priceless PS Dems are in the same boat
SuperView	I liked getting this extra news video Daddy 😂

Ivar	No no let u self regulate that ha always worked to the benefit of the consumer s
Trevonn Caesar	I mean the world knew how much eppi pen costed for year before they finally dropped the price so we are gon na have to see how supply and demand work or stick to weed
Attira Kell	I think this is a great idea Love to see big pharm have to be more transparent about how much they screw u
Wandering Llama	This is one of the only thing I like this administration doing I ’ m on some pricey medication and it absolutely blew my mind away when I looked at my insurance bill We a citizen of a free nation must have the right to know how much a medication cost before they are handed a prescription We wouldn ’ t walk into a store or car dealership and pick out what we want without knowing anything about the price before we promise to pay the full amount
oddeda	1 08 Death can become permanent really
Parta Canna	American problem so I just skip this one
swampwater dog	Honestly they overperscribe drug There s not enough communication about how and what the drug interact with help your body harm you etc etc They absolutely should tell you how much shit cost especially in ad on TV They can state price may vary due to insurance or help from your doctor since they often have sample coupon
Becoming me Everyday	Even if the price don ’ t come down Transparency is a step in the right direction and yes very surprised this administration is pushing for it I think it ’ s a good move
Nicolas Hernandez	Not gon na lie this is something that I really feel the Trump administration is doing right Hopefully they keep expanding this
Joey TheMagicHeroX	Have more Phil in it
Smile Elims	Kind of mixed feeling On the plus side yes the patient client will have more clarity on how much something is in total With anything medical wise we should know what it cost to get a medication prior to check out Transparency is a big want by people so I can see this going towards a positive direction The biggest con many and I mean MANY Americans do not understand how billing work in healthcare I m in the DME durable medical equipment aspect and many people get scared of that sticker price because it usually is pretty flipping high This would cause a lot of unnecessary panic a to people seeing a commercial having something cost thousand of dollar If they do have to post the actual price they should in big bold capital letter state that it is the price based on the billing code and insurance will vary the price you may be paying
Matt Girardot	Drug company could still list their price in their advertising AND also mention that the cost to the consumer may vary depending on which insurance the consumer carry They could just add that to the list of side effect
John Healey	Could it cause drug company to lower their price Could not doing anything cause drug company to lower their price What doe make thing cheaper is competition
FilZ008	Portugal also ha these drug ad
SupMyNameIsDann	Let ’ s start the morning show everytime with ‘ hello hello welcome to the morning show ’
R.0. B.	While I couldn ’ t be le of a fan of Trump I ’ m not stubborn enough to reject anything just for having his name on it And honestly I wish he did more stuff like this Using his knowledge of business and industry to help better law meant for protecting consumer and a long a it ’ s responsible help kindle the flame of American business
Chase Mueller	No matter how much I hate the Trump administration and even though they ’ re trying to take away my civil liberty I got ta feel a little bad for them at time like this Their main two audience are old people and rich people and in this case the old people are buying the med and the rich people are selling them You win some you loose some
pangod666	As much a i dislike Trump this is the best proposal thingy he s ever been involved in
V1DE0	These new change will only put a small dent in the evil monstrosity that is big pharma but it still a step in the right direction
Caabooose	Drug company and Insurance are just scam anyways always taking more and more giving le and le sure insurance is nice to have when something happens but then the 99 that nothing happened to ha to pay more and because of the over paid b drug company and hospital and the like can over charge
Geoff Handsome	I need my medicationnnnnnn
Pedro Barcelos	Here in Brazil we have a law that created non branded drug every dr have to prescript the drug by their ingredient not by any brand This allows the patient to be able to buy prescription drug at a much lower price some of those non branded medicine are 80 cheaper than the branded one
sam van der plas	Wow imagine having such a crap healthcare system that this is even a thing
Mr Boberson	Good mythical morning let s talk about that
Jei Esterline	No one give up their bottom line for the good of humanity They will find a way around it
Lisa J	Worth a shot It s not gon na bankrupt these company and might just help out the consumer so I say give it a whirl
Gabby Galloway	Love the new editing style
TOMOKIN - Ryota Tomogane -	Drinking coffee homesick playing PUBG watching Philip could I ask your good morning
Kenzie Taylor	I think anything where I have to open my wallet to get should be transparent with it s price
Rocksaltz WID A Z	0 52 Man I ve only been to America once and I ve already seen these type of commercial
Roland.L.F Music	I love the new editing it give the PDS a nice sense of flow
Mark Writt	It would be cool if they could lower the risk of permanent death That being said I primarily watch show online not on tv This probably won t be noticed by people that get their primary entertainment online Tv ad only not website or social medium
Andrea Peters	I really like starting my work day like this Thank you
daniel breece	Yes more
Elliot Sternberg	Surprised Trump s administration is doing this but in favor If they don t lower price it ll increase support for medicare for all Win win
Sara Miller	I think that our government should take a far harder stance on big Pharma Drugs used for medical purpose should not be considered a luxury that only the rich can afford People should not be going into debt even with insurance because they were born with a disorder or unlucky enough to contract a disease that need treatment for short or long period of time I won t even go into what prescription Opioids and other pain medication can do to a person This being said I do think this is a step in the right direction When I go to the doctor I always make sure to research medication before I buy them through my insurance and pharmacy everyone should do this I ve saved plenty of money a well a making sure I am not taking many pill Pharma having to disclose pricing would make this easier especially for those that can not afford tool for research like internet phone computer and such I personally feel that it should go a step further Medical care in general should be considered a basic human right for so many reason
Ryan's Adventure & Info	Holy shit Trump actually doing something right Never thought I would say or type that considering all past behavior Hopefully this proposal isn t just a publicity stunt
cstldk	a an European these ad and just their sheer running time were shocking to me when I first watched American TV
Nicholas Art	Holy shit the Trump administration is actually doing something good
Eugene Horan	Phil you should use a separate backdrop for the morning show It would be great to tell the difference between your daily show and morning
bigpanda1228	A much more important change occurred last week that permit but doe not compel you pharmacist to tell you if a drug you are buying would be cheaper without your insurance For example the minimum out of pocket I pay with my current insurance Harvard Pilgrim is 10 But the generic of a short course of some drug can be around 3 5 That mean I am paying at least twice a much a I need to If I make it a habit to say “ and how much would this cost without my insurance ” I can and will save immediately I am in favor of the pricing information you discus and other change that can help bring down cost but the pharmacist rule is done in force Learn to ask
Kahli21	I think this is stupid We shouldn t add anything for advertising medication on tv we need to completely ban advertising medication on tv magazine newspaper etc People see them and diagnose themselves with something or they think it s some great thing they should try and are encouraged to do so by talking to their doctor but medication is something really complex and shouldn t be so lightly considered There are a lot of factor that can affect what that medication doe including but not limited to gender age current health issue hereditary condition or predisposition other medication or supplement or OTC being taken allergy especially to dye that are often found in medication and so much more Advertising lead to people insisting to their doctor that they want to try this medication or worse have a Munchausen s like reaction where they manifest the symptom and thus convince a doctor they need the medication not intentionally though The worst part about that is that doctor are paid to promote and prescribe those medication and the le ethical one will prescribe them even if they re not appropriate or there are realistically too many risk They don t advertise medication like this in Europe Here s a very interesting paper about direct advertising http www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc article PMC2661977 A disturbing quote from that Doctors typically acquiesce with patient who request drug that they have seen advertised and this increase both population drug use rate and healthcare cost
Thomas Decarlo	There s already a proven model to lower prescription drug out there and it s north of the border
Thomas Long	Infringe of First Amendment Rights Oh yeah just like those darn nutrition fact and ingredient list that are on food I don t know if it will have the intended effect but I don t really see much of a downsize with these additional requirement Like how if I am remembering correctly fast food chain are legally required to display calorie on menu but that did not end up reducing the amount of food people order It didn t have the desired effect But I don t see any big downside with it
Mark Morgan	I m surprised that you didn t mention the president s signing on september 25 of the S 2554 Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the S 2554 that prohibits the use of gag clause which would seem pretty relevant to me when talking about clarity in the drug industry
maridontable	Good work Trump
rubymimosa	Cheeto doing something that seemingly will help the common person Well he doesn ’ t take any prescribed med right I ’ m deeply suspicious of him doing ANYthing Pharma fighting to keep their med cost hidden is unsurprising but Cheeto ’ s push for it to happen is interesting I don ’ t think anything but generic competition is going to help pricing If the fed govt is serious about encouraging those manufacturer I ’ m actually for something this asshat is doing
Duncan Mackenzie	Does anyone actually ask their doctor about the shit they see on tv I ve always just trusted my doctor to prescribe my medication
Dary Collazo	FINALLY Some legislation is being done about the cost of prescription drug My mom need some medication that just her co pay is 93 which we can t afford so she just deal with the pain This is just an example but there are people that require life saving med like insulin that is priced at around 600 a vial I don t think this law would really help consumer What should be done is more of a standardization rule where company are required to keep their price within a range so it can be affordable to more people
Michelle Escarfullery	Why ask a law professor and not and economist professor
Jammin428	The 1 2 and 3 criterion for a free market to function properly is transparency If consumer do not have the information required to make comparative decision the system break I don t know if this will bring price down but theoretically it should help And the fact that the Pharmaceutical company are fighting it you know this will impact something
Sapien	Watch a hundred of commenters commit double think to squash Pres Trump into a box labled Evil Racist
RBL MIA	Please keep doing this I love news in the morning but I avoid it because all I hear it Trump bad killing shooting This wa a great snip bit of stuff I hope you grow large enough to have a 24 7 coverage team
An Overdose	That s why we need to stop the comercials or advertising at all Pharmacy company should not be able to advertise to consumer Your doctor should prescribe drug for you not go to your doctor asking for certain drug So Fukn dumb
NotYourMothersFrenchToast	Takes my morning prescription while loading this video Well damn
tahlia molloy	This is insane to me a someone who work in the pharmacy industry in Australia that in america you can legally advertise perscription drug Not even all otc medication can be advertised here
3ch1dna 07	It won t make a difference because if you need it then you need it At one point my doctor had me on prescription totaling 200 a month after insurance After I threatened to stop them all because I couldn t afford it she then cut it back to 30 but of course at the risk of my health My son s inhaler cost 147 a month which we always have to scrape together and then make do with unhealthy food because the healthy one cost too much In the end if you need it then you got ta have it no matter the price listed
wendy_illa	Ha ha Latuda s commercial coma or death a these may become permanent I had a quack psychiatrist that put me on 6 different med including Latuda and xanax I have generalized anxiety disorder and a d d I m not bipolar so the Latuda wa just not needed and I wa prescribed it when Latuda first came out on the market That horrible doctor keep me sedated and high for a year Do your research before seeing any psychiatrist a this is common practice for them and pain relief clinic There is a website provided by the government that allows patient to look up their doctor to see how much money pharmaceutical company have given them http openpaymentsdata cm gov
Madeline Elizabeth	This is the first time I feel good about a large change Trump ha made
IoEstasCedonta	So that other HHS story
MCTheTrash	Nice video love the visual quality Looks like you wan na spend le time filming and wan na just do audio do audio from home so you just added on the first and last bit which where probably filmed the day before to make it still have that old vibe The new style is really high quality and a long a we still have the old one in the regular video I am loving it
Job Pastor	This will be a great implementation if it doe officially go through
Noble Ghosts	I always like to watch these morning video on the way to school please do more of these video please
graphite	Love the short and sweet pre DeFranco show I m for it for sure
Marie Domander	I am so glad I don t live in america
BRTxNL	Finally credit where credit is due this seems to be a good move by the Trump Administration Didn t think they would take on the Pharma Industry
Andrew Ament	Radical idea don t take pill you don t need don t accept script just because a doctor gave them to you If it s an opioid how about just don t take it longer than you need to and don t go back for more There is no reason to have a high rate of people on drug it s a farce
gulazi	Okay something should be done but I m skeptical Could this lead to people opting for some type of treatment because it is cheaper than a competitor regardless of side effect It seems odd that people regardless of education are being directed ad for thing which are likely way more complex than the typical person can fully comprehend ie I m in Canada and would rather a doctor provide suggestion maybe I m confused about your system in the US though
Alissa K	I love the information but the issue with price is that the ultimate consumer price varies based on insurance I love the proactive measure but what it cost someone with top of the line insurance versus someone with a Humana Obama basic plan versus no plan is very very different Edit yes people with different plan can do the math but I don ’ t have enough faith in our populace to handle thinking thing through
dyl flah	Fair competition is the best thing for the human race
eninman03	Wait a fucking moment death can be permanent Aww man and here I wa waiting to come back like jesus
FierceJadeMakeup	Hey this actually sound like a good thing or at least a good step Our medical system is so screwed that we have to take baby step
Onehotsnow	Wtf is this early or late
Lyn Warm0ct0bernites	Wow Phil you read my mind Pricing did go up I used to pay 10 for generic but it went up for me Thank you for covering this topic
Mike Orr	I don t know if it will help but I highly doubt it could hurt
SheaTheUnicorn	When you re in a coma and your dr won t answer their phone liiiiiike 👀
Anabelle Nevermore	It s Tuesday noon
amber black	I pay over 200 a month for prescription So i ’ m up for anything that may help lower drug price
onealmusicgroup	If you ’ re going to do this for tv it need to be done for social medium a well due to the volume of consumer who use those platform
Kayvahn	How about instead we do what every other developed country in the world doe and stop leaving it up to these bourgeois leech to do the right thing or stop trying to coerce them into doing it and flat out tell them this is what you re doing or you re being shut down
Zach Byrd	He s not all the way he s only halfway dead Big difference
Sara	This policy is the ONLY policy I have agreed with and liked in this joke of an administration People usually have no idea how much their medication actually cost and when I wa working a a pharmacy tech it wa disgusting how much a big pharma company can charge and even up the price of an important medication when the demand is high — think AuviQ and Epi Pen fiasco about a year or two ago The public is ill informed about the cost of medication and that need to change
ShiaraMoon	As someone who take 2 Rx ’ s a month I am all for this People still buy car even though the price are listed in ad why should Rx ’ s be any different
Tobias97768	Tell me whats the catch someone must gain something Publicity Theyll sleep on their wannabe good deed and call it a day
Jon Withey	i think stating the MSRP just like the auto industry is a good thing for transparency As for am i surprised the Trump admin is moving this direction No this wa one of his campaign idea He additionally said he d like to see hospital show their billing price prior to treatment so that we would be able to shop around on where we go and aren t being unknowingly charged and gouged for ridiculous thing like 5 per phone call or 1 per tissue etc
skyler and friends	Loved the extra vid Keep it up Phil 😃 It s crazy i have watched you for nearly 11 year now and it s the longest thing I ve ever consistently done Lol Though u haven t seen me grow I have seen you grow and evolve into a really cool dude and now seemingly great father Luv yo face haha Backwards cap for throwback Thursday Hahaha
alyciadweeb	I love the way this video wa edited I ’ m a long time subscriber and fan of the show but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by how quickly you deliver info which don ’ t get me wrong is actually part of why I LOVE your show too I don ’ t want to be watching the news for hour I ’ m just a visual learner So to have bullet point and graph and captioned highlight wa really helpful to me and I feel like I ’ m leaving this video educated and ready to discus the topic with others I know it take longer to edit video this way but it ’ s something I ’ d love to see more of in the future Regardless keep up the great work and I LOVE YO FACE
Caitlyn Schuller	My main concern here is that this is about tv ad and doesn t apply to print or social medium Maybe this is my I gave up cable for Netflix YEARS ago bias but I think social medium ad would be even more important with life the way it is now Is this actual progress or an empty gesture I m really hoping this will be more effective than it seems to me right now
BRamirez1991	Was it just me or did the editing give the video a different feel
Kolton Nay	I m very against Trump but I admit when his administration doe something I actually like I ll also admit that it s happened more time than I thought it would
Lindsay Clay	As someone who ha Battled stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer since 2011 and is possible a stage 5 now yup it go that high I am behind showing price One of the thing I have to battle the most is insurance NOT the pharmaceutical company If you really want to know why I actually love pharmaceutical company all probably reply in the comment below The insurance company actually have set different price for the med I found the same company offering to cover my prescription saying it cost them 4 different price then AFTER the discount wa giving it made it look like better difference for them I have picture to prove that hell I went through in 2015 This would make the price locked in so the insurance company would have to completely honor the coverage they say they give you it is not the same now I also feel people would be le likely to go get on a new drug without doing more research on it Already most med when you go to use fill the prescription for the first time any where between 1dose 1 month to at least a year you can get help covering it from the company that make it Either go to their website or call and they can walk you through what it will take to get help There is a price difference for Medicare also most of the time Medicare will void if you use any assistance from them pharmaceutical company Having the price printed a suggested is going to be more helpful than the side effect read at 300 word a minute You either have side effect or you don t and if you notice you body being strangely different for a decent amount of time depending on the problem medicine or not you should be contacting you doctor Another thing that would really help u a human is to slow down on the Over the Counter med Talking to your doctor first you can often find that changing what you consume or something added changed taken away from your routine can help more than OtCs can I think once people start seeing true price doing more research that is helpful with the information that is coming from a direct source and trusting in their doctor key to trusting doctor is to first find one that doesn t want to shove more med at you can really help everyone over all I think the change listed are a great start and over time we can work to get people in office to help fine tune them
elzeus13	Expand it beyond TV
kayla Barnes	1 Thank you for covering this 2 Powers are actually trying to do something about instead of being selfish piece of
Lydia Marie	Trump Administration doing something I can get behind I don t know what to do with this lydia exe ha encountered an error
jordaan davidson	Always love these extra morning show Philly D 👍 keep up the good work
ImAManMann	So did Philip stay up all night
Reece Shaw	Y all are in a treat to learn how much some of those specialty medication cost I think it will mobilize a lot of people to realize just how bad drug company are I used to work for a specialty pharmacy The cost of some cancer drug would make you sick
Stickbo	Wait are people actually using commercial to make recommendation to their doctor I m cool with this regulation but I just find it depressing that Americans are taking drug based on commercial
Maria Casella	Side effect from a medication literally put me in a coma for 5 1 2 day I live in pain no medicine at all medication are way way too expensive
Agamemnon	Lo hello
nicolle navarro	I like this it ’ s nice listening to news in the morning when I wake up to go to school
Detective_panda	Liked the morning video
zac degen	Liberal medium will either A Give Trump praise on addressing what is a largely unspoken yet significant problem in American society B Twist themselves in knot in order to spin this story in a negative way against Trump Answer B
Martin Mendiola	We Mexicans only have that vapoorub work on everything cold fever broken bone supernatural phenomenon and pretty much anything health related 😁
jestx101	will always click a video I feel is informative and useful good luck with the new workflow
SirPsycho9	Morning show at 14 21h hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
CasualNotice	At the very least causing pharmaceutical company to put their MSRP out there in their ad make it possible for generic manufacturer to gauge a potential market for generic alternative When the EpiPen price scaling came to light a surprising number of company started gearing up to produce knock offs
BootyHoleBandit	I ’ ll see what happens before praising this administration
Valère Hirwa	1 07 Uhmm how is this legal
Katherine Dickson	Good evening from Australia I m liking this small PDS As I can go to sleep with this then wake up to the main PDS
CreationsFlare	I feel conflicted This is actually a solid step and seems to be a fear measure that the Trump Administration want to put on Big Pharma to at least change Nobody actually expected that Alex would attempt it too considering his track record Thing is depending on whether or not it actually go through the threat itself could actually not have much of an effect at all It also doesn t particularly stop the rampant abuse in the corporate doctor field of Prescribe Today Re scribe tomorrow A reach around might happen whereas said commercial could be tweaked to justify said cost and we end up at Square 1 We d have to see how it progress and if it actually doesn t get lost in congress I could see both side actually disagreeing to this on principle of the lobbyist holding people down so it ll come down to a number vote
CAMERYN COLEMAN	I work for a product and pharmaceutical litigation group that represents company that s would be affected I ll be sure to pas this video on to some of the associate
skelly	the pd show go up at 5 since when
Scarlett	Wow That suck Glad to live in Canada 👌
Amelia Rhodes	The truth is most medication have side effect and doctor have turned their office into conveyor belt experience They aren t there for your medical need but rather to sell pill My mother had diabetes heart disease and died of complication due to malpractice to treat her failing kidney Aside from her lifestyle the blood pressure med s she wa RXed exacerbate diabetes and may cause renal kidney failure Two clinic wanted to put me on the same med s I ended up at the ER twice Guess who isn t going back to any of the doctor I can afford to see I suggest you stop taking ANYTHING a doctor tell you on faith and do your own research listen to your own body and know your family history Because most doctor are too busy to care
Truth Seeker	I like the idea of increasing competition to lower price through this system The pharma bastard have such a tight grip on our collective consciousness It s happening right now before you through the dosing of hundred of thousand on drug altering their conscious state of mind Sometimes it s legitimate such a the treating of schizophrenia but honestly the vast majority of these emotional disorder that people can use a an excuse for their selfish neurotic behavior and then they get prescription drug that dull them out and then if they want they can start selling them to their friend because they fuck them up and in the end you get the current drug crisis and 10 year old on Adderall You can t tell me it isn t the willful selling of human life Those at the tippity top of the separate industry view the greater mass a theirs to milk for money Shill out more of that money to them on technology and food that make you sick and you wind up having to pay for your health later on This should come to no suprise to you should you just take a good long look at the state of our current culture and the complete erosion of common decency and respect It s a sickness of both the body and mind and it is crippling the developed nation of the world and it s coming for the rest a well The current global culture if all of them had to be distilled into one is one of death and give new meaning to the root of the word cult ure even though that isn t the proper etymology of the word it still seems rather fitting And you moron think transhumanism will save you You body s perhaps but certainly not your soul The sci fi movie should tell you that No more how far we go a a specie the issue will that plague humanity now will follow u through the star should we get that far We need an individual revolution of thought One where everyone and I mean everyone get over their self loathing petty bullshit addiction anger issue or procrastination and take complete control of their life Never again taking a step out of the infinite moment of the now A people who s thought match their word that match their action That is what we need if we are to stand a chance against the bahemoth that stand before u that the uneducated would call the Illuminati There is no one unified group that owns the world is a bunch of competing oligarchy group but a time go on they will begin sharing their secret to one another and you will see the Biblical enacting of a public one world government no longer in the shadow a it is now They will one day make it play a day who owns you but by then the VR will be so good no one will notice anyway That is unless we stop them first
Cindi LaLond	To continue with the auto industry example The price shown in car ad is not the price you pay either depending on your credit state tax rate and registration fee the car price is way differenr Not to mention if you pay MSRP for a car including all that you have not negotiated well enough with your dealer I think this is a fantastic way to help consumer Not a fan of our current administration but a big fan of this proposed change Something ha to be done
Mocking Moniker	Why is Donald increasing government power
Lester Suggs	Morning news Hell yes
Chase Jacobs	I m not a Trump fan but I think these are good measure Also once again pointing out to my conservative friend that the Republican party is not the small government party it portrays itself to be a we can see by the change these measure would take
Genta	Some serious side effect may include death Ah that pesky death I hope they find a cure soon I highly recommend the prescription drug segment that John Oliver did if u haven t seen it Its on his YouTube channel
Jude Frazee	My family ha 3 pharmacy drug we need regularly 2 of which are about 10 and the 3rd of which requires me to work extra hour to afford With insurance I d love to see that cost come down Especially because the 3rd one is for my kid
Richard smith	Im not a fan of trump But damn Give the man some credit for this one
J. S	seems like a great thing until you realize that the new NAFTA deal make drug price more expensive for all of u Flash the right hand so they can t see what s in the left hand
ImmortalInflames	Only effective way to lower price is to have actual competitor Drug company often patent their drug so it is very hard for other company to make their own version Basically the whole system is full of cancer The first real step is to focus on free public health care for every American citizen while this get worked on have law put in place for the government being able to negotiate on price similar to Australia with drug medication Also how the Hospitals Insurance company are able to make a fortune out of price gouging need to have fair and responsible price capping in a perfect world if the big company the richest 10 of people paid their very share of tax something like 57 once you are over 1 million we would have more than enough money for Health Care Education Infrastructure Also while I m talking the dream heavily tax anything being imported that America is able to build themselves eg Cars Meat and the government should consider small loan to help out people start their own bsiness like they did after the war and finally let go one step even further reduce spending on military contract by about 10 a lot of the spending is just to keep big military company happy a they spend a lot to lobby for their own cause more business And with that small 10 reduction spend ALL OF IT on Helping the Homeless Veterans Housing counselling Jobs Medicare They served America and it s about damn time America look after them
Your Own Pay	I ’ d like this but one thing ha me slightly concerned As I am completely blind consumer not having it audibly available on the commercial mean that having advertised price a doe absolutely nothing different for me than what it doe now On the other hand I do like having a website I can go to to review the pricing information myself Add the website to the end of the commercial so I know where I can go and get pricing information
Orion	Yeah pharma should not be allowed to advertise
HGGundamreviews	Generally in historic context when company have to publish their price in the full view of the public eye price war of sort happen Causing price to drop a company attempt to make their product the most appealing to the consumer Given yes this doesn t always occur but it happens more often than not I think it s a good first step and if after a given period it doesn t help the government still ha the option of putting in place price control Not a great option but one that might be needed given some of the price increase we have seen in the recent past for life saving drug that come from limited source
LexofGotham	Or call me crazy you could just NOT ADVERTISE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Jesus Americans live in a bizarre dystopia Canadians pay for our prescription too unless you have coverage but you get a prescription based on what s wrong with you not what you saw on TV And if you have trouble affording something often the pharmacist will just substitute the generic version of whatever you need because it doesn t matter which you re getting they do the same job
Anders Taylor	Thank you for this I have so many prescription for my health problem and I didn ’ t know about this Please continue covering these type of “ le attractive ” story that actually affect more people
Blake Wilkinson	Morning show is a great way to start my day Thanks Phil
Joeshirou	It s a fluff piece It wont do anything besides get people to ask for generic if there is any But in the end if there wa a Rx you needed to live and there wa no generic and it cost 500 to buy but you insurance covered say 80 you d still buy it
Logical Reason	Lol what theory It s called price discrimination professor
aalexsoccer20	This look more like a strategic move by the party This is to ensure since they have a majority of justice that a ruling will be in the favor of the pharmaceutical industry
Vayhn	Hey phil are you gon na talk about the trump admin deciding to legally define gender
Barba rossa	I tend to be a fan of le government involvement our day to day life but I have yet to hear an argument I agree with against consumer protection law that simply require information disclosure Also I enjoy these short morning video
thunderjolt	Good morning Let s get this bread
DarkRanger919	Well not gon na lie this sound good
Ryan Horton	Did I just like Trump Oh Oh no Aaaand I just shit my pant
RoseByChoice	It ’ s interesting to me the number of people who are surprised that this would happen during the Trump era only because the Democrats are backed by big Pharma majority and the gun company are back by the Republicans majority there are some lap over but genuinely one side attack the other side and the other side attack back when it their turn I ’ m also skeptical because this seems like a lateral move only because medicine is not optional for most people even if people are now more inclined to get it faster and they were in the past I know drug abuse is optional once you ’ re addicted to the drug it ’ s a little more than just quitting I feel like that ’ s not turn out like the energy drink company is where they ’ re creating fact and company to be their competitor with higher price It ’ s immoral but we ’ re also talk about the medical company here I don ’ t think this is a win I think this is a step in the right direction towards a win but I also feel like everyone ’ s gon na give Donald Trump the congratulation on that and so many other people did more It also must be really fucked up to be those Americans people because you could create the cure to cancer and Donald Trump would try to nuke Canada tomorrow and kill dozen of Americans and your thing would just nullified and is the only president where I could believe that statement I don ’ t know the central eastern me want is dad in during the Donald Trump era just to watch people lose their shit but we put so much of that during this presidency that I ’ m realizing that slow in a cute way more dangerous than overnight anarchy 😓
Abram Maldonado	This wa a wonderful surprise to wake up to
Hadders_07	Great news for the state but I still do not understand why they are allowed to advertise directly to the public Surely my doctor should be telling me which is the most effective medication for the ailment I am suffering I am from the UK and I just find it so bizarre Credit where credit is due on this policy though I am no fan of trump but this seems like a good move
Kushagra Verma	Nice animation
marvioxious1989	Americans are drug dependent How sad
7r0113r	Obama s tyrannical campaign to force people into buying overpriced drug and drive more money to pharma company while Americans die in the street is finally coming to an end The free market competition will drive necessary drug and insurance down to affordable cost for all Americans
Rebecca Vasquez	I think they will either put the price down in those tiny letter in the bottom of the screen or advertise a lower price by saying it for a lower dosage but when people fo to the doctor they will be prescribed a higher dosage at a higher cost
emmi ruu	3 am wtf Phil
Engineering Nonsense	Death may become perminant No one told me that
Ethan Ingmire	Yes more phile
agidyne967	Phil Hello hell Me No Its 2 in the morning Im going to bed
Duncan Ramsay	I had an anti siezure pill once upon a time that cost 120 per pill
NinthTentacle	This sound like a good plan but I wish the price wa said aloud for folk who are visually impaired
Freddie Hoff	I feel nothing I don t buy drug
Lycaon 1765p	Coma or death a these might become permanent Yeah death is fairly permanent
BSinator	Thanks for reminding me to take my med this morning daddy Phil
Jeremy Cote	In general I don t think this change will bring much but it s my belief that a more informed public is a safer public do I d say this is a net positive
reidabee	Love getting the morning video Phil I don t see this a a surprise from the Trump administration a he s a very pro consumer person and is looking for more way to get into the public s favor Even if this doesn t get company to lower their price I think it s a great way to increase transparency I can see how there could be some confusion regarding insurance plan so there s some great room for debate and I m excited to see what come out of that and how that will factor in to what I hope will become law
Shoibyrd	The negotiation of price is a HUGE step The government pay ridiculous price on medication The Government is literally gouged from the hospital industry for money paying a much a 3x more then someone with another insurance And when it come down to an inhaler costing 35 dollar and medicare caid have to pay 150 for it with a copay of 7 the price show That add up fast Or the ER charging an extra 300 for Medicaid processing You can see them nickle and diming I m sure it s worse in larger city a well There doe need to be some legislation on drug maybe rather then forcing them to show their price they should be forced to comply with the world pricing market Or even making them comply with reasonable rate no more affordable drug jumping to 300 3000 over night Make them have steady rate so they can only raise those price by penny They always claim research and funding but we all know it s just the CEO fattening up so they are set for life You can find majority of them have taken raise for their so called good work
luis hernandez	I can ’ t believe i ’ m saying this but is the trump administration is actually doing something good for the public
Alvin Peña-Reynosa	Yea
UranusProductions1	Or you know follow the example of literally every other country besides New Zealand
Sicom	It s surprising sort of I guess the insurance company are putting more money into the pocket of politician than the pharma company
Flippy Sidee	For once I m actually with Trump on something Definitely didn t expect this from his administration pleasantly surprised
Pulse Fel	Think back to mister 5000 they don t care in the end
piaoliang jiejie	Call your doctor if there is coma or death a these may become permanent lol your dead isn t that permanent enough
g1598	America s healthcare is the single most worst in the world seriously you spend so much money for basically very little benefit
Ruaraidh Disher	Main takeaway from this privatised health care is a disgusting shit show
zhzjk	Yet nothing is done to change pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group who control the prescription for insurance company Each charging different price for the same drug These company used to use bulk purchasing power to lower the cost of drug but have since abused rebate system to inflate their own margin at the expense of patient and insurance company
Abigail Mac	YOU HAVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTS Things I ve never even thought of From an outside perspective it sound so odd to hear a company trying to sell you drug whilst listing the side effect including death in that soothing small print voice a the music go twinkle twinkle in the background
Huldah Cripps	Loved the death being permanent bit
Strawberry cat	“ Death may become permanent ” Hell yeah
Olivier Hudon	This episode is brought to you by betterpills com phillyd
uaedaien	Absolutely fantastic plan Should apply to addsand all print medium and stick with the list cost
Shannon Wells	As someone who isn t a fan of the trump administration I do have to say I m happy they are taking this measure though I do think it s more of a half measure This is something I also had a problem with Obamacare and that is that if we re not negotiating drug price like every other first world country doe then the consumer is being shafted This wa something both Trump and Obama promised they d do but then took pharma money and didn t It irritates me greatly That said this might help a little so it s good
Vecka	Im not from the States or New Zealand so I can t really give my two cent on the matter But I think more correct information can t hurt and it show that there are people out there willing to stand up to eco giant for the consumer sake
John Juhl	The extra morning show is like an early Christmas present make waking up early for work more tolerable Thanks Phil and crew
Flannel Fishing	A good day start with a cup of coffee and getting Phil d in
Just browsing the store...	Wow they finally did something good So close to November a well lol
McCauley Arts	I like this progression If they re already required to inform u their medication may cause death then whats the problem with telling u how much death may cause I just don t know that I agree with only showing it and not announcing it and even then only having it pertain to TV ad and not everything else I hope they re lowballing the idea so they can say later We re putting it on EVERYTHING later to look good because it just doesn t seem to make sense to do it on one ad and not all of them I can understand online ad not everything ha their direct price there but those add are connected to a website that should have pricing anyway
Sally Aquin	Personally I predict that pharma company will find a loophole and get around this proposal They always do There s so much wrong with the healthcare industry in the United States I think it would take much more to even begin to fix all the issue
name	Yes more morning show
mutehowl	Well there is the price that hospital and doctor office pay and what the customer patient ha to pay A ten foot tube of plastic hose should never cost me 80 to 90 dollar When i can go to any store and buy a similar tube hose for 10 buck
Bella MacTavish	Well I ’ m in England so I don ’ t know why I ’ m watching this
Daniil Vasilenko	Lowering drug price could also lower the price of insurance
PeppersPoops	Honestly I m surprised you haven t mentioned Canada legalizing cannabis yet I figured it wa pretty big news
Kris Torisky	I think this would be a great change to the pharmaceutical Market that could really benefit consumer Transparency in pricing would certainly help consumer make better financial decision even if the company do not lower their price
Glenn Miller	I see this a fantastic news I am so tired of those commercial This would be a great step a far a I m concerned
Pika Pika	It feel amazing to wake up to one of your video
juicepimpson	He s doing SOMETHING Better than the nothing we have had for decade
Quincy L Jones	What the shit DeFranco
henry mcdonough	Hey so honest feedback while I did enjoy the overall content of the video the style doesn t match expectation and while I can live with that one thing that truly bother me is how some thing on screen move more than necessary Example the logo seen here 4 56
Layla109	This seems like a step in the right direction but if the law is made final there s still no guarantee the pharma company will lower the price enough to make it easier on poor Americans Simply knowing the price won t help make it affordable but it IS something Not trying to be negative but it s a logical skepticism As Phill say Hope for the best but expect the worst
Carlos Rodriguez	I m not a fan of most regulation but I do appreciate regulating honesty Good move
Legacy	On occasion the trump administration surprise me by doing something that isn t completely evil I m all for this I think instead of listing the price of the drug though they should be forced to list the name of competitor
Kilrathi	As someone who pay about 300 for a particular prescription that I need to function a a basic human being I m fully in support of these change Transparency bring competition competition brings better pricing
Jen Woo	Hmmm
Alan Ray	The argument that drug company say this will deter consumer from getting the drug they “ need ” is a bogus claim Their provider will tell them if they need a particular medication Which brings up another thing next is bringing up ethnical standard from not being influenced by the pharmaceutical company would have a greater impact
TranQuil	better help and cv were hand in hand you fed them information and manipulated mental health patient good shit big nose
wemii76	I think you re lying there s no way in the world the Trump Administration would ever do anything to help anyone JK I think it s a good start and they can review thing and get more done down the road hopefully They could be setting up where they give the drug company the option of either listing their price or not be allowed to do advertising at all that can be one way to encourage compliance As far a lowering the price that will just be something that ha to be seen after the rule get put into effect
sophie	could impact anyone who buy prescription drug any american
PrimeSlime. bon	Ok I love these like one topic morning video
Aldo VaSkeet	This is being brought out before the election to give his team a bump Nothing will come of it
Damien Talrose	I wonder how mainstream news medium will turn this against Trump
cole Recksiedler	Good morning show for most good night show for me
Sohel Islam	I like the new addition to the video format and also the animation might make it seem more approachable and pleasing to some people
Remy D	Not surprised Trump ha always been about the consumer and the middle class people He s lowered tax for them Can t wait to say to my doctor why are you forcing to go with a brand that is 2000 more experience than the alternative
Geo Space	What happens if the change the pill count to 29 day instead of 30 Do all the rule no longer apply to them
Megan Green	First off I loving having the additional video in the morning It s nice get a little bonus video about additional news topic to start my day Second I do think it s a great idea to advertise the price of the product in the ad So many time the drug will say here is the benefit of taking this medicine then list a behemoth sized list of potential side effect When I saw an ad for the IUD I have it didn t state it price and I thought the ad wa a little sneaky for doing that w o insurance it would have been at least 1500 or 1600 Showing people the price of these news worthy medicine will definitely benefit the consumer if nothing else it will encourage people to find similar or generic prescription for better price As to whether it will lower the price maybe over time some company will lower the price a little bit but not a significantly a some of them should I don t expect this to lower price but it s at least a step in the right direction for consumer
The Lawn Care Nut	Try reading the disclaimer and factual pricing transparency on an automotive ad lol
Fenrir5522	God damn it phill Since the video is obviously about a change in regulation you gave me hope when you said we were one of the only two country to advertise then you scared the shit out of me when you mentioned that the side affect listing are required by law Lol I don t like this new proposal It make this already damaged commercialized view of medication more commercialized We don t need to increase the selling of prescription medication This is one of the most disgusting modern outcome of everyday capitalism IMO
C Tac	No one watch TV
GKXPress	Yes This is great Hope they actually get this to go through
ThunderGoatz	Why do Americans take so many drug
Yesenia Garcia	I love when you out extra content in the morning You go straight to an important event going on rather than talking about YouTube stuff or advertising
Dragonslayer2315	It s BACK
stockart whiteman	If the drug company are worried about confusion why not just say price may vary with insurance or something Seems like a bullshit excuse to me
Chris Goergen	lose the bouncy icon and text it is buzzfeedy
Matt L	I think this would be amazing if it work tho I ’ m wondering if there will actually be change or if it will cause pharma company to shift their advertising platform from tv to social medium and other online platform since only tv is included in the proposal It make you wonder if these ad will have to include the price in YouTube ad and other online video or if they distinction is just tv
Veikkuli Piirakka	this is going to effect everyone only effect american gj
Sleeo	I hope that this will lower prescription drug price My mom ha a connective tissue disorder that ha most likely been passed down to me named Ehlers Danlos Syndrome that cause her to be in constant pain 24 7 365 She take 10 pill a day just to be able to get out of bed and even then she ha day where all she can do is lay or sit down and can barely walk She had to quit her job at a nature center a few year back because her EDS and Neuropathy got so bad that she couldn ’ t care for all of the animal anymore Most of the medicine she take are relatively inexpensive with our insurance and everything but some of them can still be pricey I can ’ t imagine how someone with EDS and not enough money to pay for their medicine must feel
MrBroawesome	Geez 4 am upload y ’ all wild
Larry Wolf	Ut oh President Trump once again doing what he promised he d do Geeze a man keeping his campaign promise It s almost like he WASN T a politician or something
Jennifer Dally	Overall I like the proposal but I wish they would tweak it some I think that it should apply to all ad if it is important enough to be required in one type of ad it is important enough to be required for all ad I don t really understand pharma s objection that the list price is misleading a that is the price before insurance if that it really their concern then they can simply state that in the ad
Jordan	Don t you take my fucking Adderall Phil This is your fault if they take mine away
LivingDeadGirl	The law professor who is not an economist btw is full of shit when she say something to the effect of “ one company lowering their price doesn ’ t shame other company into doing the same thing ” If that were the case we wouldn ’ t have company willing to “ beat competitor ’ s price ” even sale price in order to lure business in By lowering their price they are being shamed And if this market competition didn ’ t happen you ’ d be driving all over town to do your grocery shopping
BerserkrB13	They have a pill for this video
Shane Breathnach	prescription drug should not be advertised directly to consumer Doctors should not be incentivised to prescribe brand name drug over generic drug when you re with your doctor they should tell you about both the brand name drug and the generic drug if they are out yet At the pharmacy the clerk should advise you of generic option encase your doctor failed to mention them in this situation you should run it by your doctor before just picking a generic drug that the clerk advised you about they may have good intention but there can be genuine reason why a generic wouldn t suffice
Fair Play	I am so glad I live in a country where cost doe not factor into my decision to seek medical help
Alex Jones	I m not living in the US so this really doesn t matter to me
A Chinese Fox	This will be interesting with biologics like Humira and Stelara costing up to 36k per month for a single dose
Pizzaxbandit	Great day for being diabetic
Nerv ClaX	Way to go Trump MAGA
Roy Kay	BigPharmaIsntAPerson BigPharmaCanFuckOffAbout1stAmendment
Celia Lovett	One thing I can always count on regarding prescription if it is new and ungodly expensive and one that insurance will fight not to cover that WILL be the medication my doctor will prescribe every time
BrokenAngelFalling	I think this is the first time in a long time that actually saw a youtube ad on the PDS Crossing finger it stay that way Also I think having a way for pharma company be more transparent through advertising would be a good thing The wording for it sound like pharma will take the specific information about prescription off their website which would limit research capability and be kinda shitty
Luke DeHart	If it wasn ’ t going to affect drug pricing I doubt Pharma would be fighting it
Jade J	Yay more defranco
Marak Of Southern	Really love the morning show
Nikola Mitevski	death which may become permanent yeah
Salaundre	The medical industry is the only industry that can charge different individual different price for the same service or product and every one think it s normal
Julia Peterson	Increasing transparency in the healthcare industry is definitely a step in the right direction It invite more competition fairer and usually lower price and give consumer more information to make the best decision for themselves Different insurance plan and their individual drug price definitely make true transparency more complex but it ’ s nice to see healthcare moving in the direction albeit one slow step at a time
A I Gaming	Ok I am fine with temporary death a a side effect but I draw the line at permanent
Clare Halacy	No the price need to be both displayed and spoken Especially when it come to pharmaceutical it is SO important for accessibility for people with disability Just requiring them to put the price on the screen completely disregard anyone with disability relating to sight
NotFunny ButFunny	Good morning
Chris Brown	If by anyone you mean Americans I am a Kiwi and we have virtually no medication ad and certainly not like the one the US ha I wa in Cali in 2016 and the medication ad shocked me They are sold like designer clothes or lifestyle aid So while we do allow direct marketing we also have very strict consumer law that stop glorification marketing We also have a fully funded public health system where almost all prescription medication is subsidized by the Govt Most prescription drug cost 5 per item on a script That s per item not per pill So a full regiment of any medication cost 5 and will also cover the cost for upto 2 repeat script As a result there is not much push for pharma company to advertise We do not require health insurance and most Kiwis dont have it Our public health system pay for all required and even some elective surgery
Momo P	4 06 First Amendment right Really Suck it up and admit it s about your bottom line The proposed rule are pretty mild Honestly they should stop pharmaceutical ad completely Spend le time making ad and more time reducing side effect Several year ago I got a prescription for an acne oral medication a day before news broke about the possible psychological side effect It took a suicide to get doctor to start warning people about it And the situation hasn t improved Most of the side effect and thing I need to avoid on my current medication I learned from forum and article And this is after reading the included information
Craig Berry	I can t see how anyone think this is a bad idea
v2thekey921	I like these early vids Nice way to start the day
wolfkilljoy	Pharma company slide billion of dollar across table how about noooooooooo
Kyra Hogue	If this actually go through I would like to think it will be a good thing I really hope it help consumer The cost on the screen should also be said out loud for those who are blind or have vision problem like senior citizen I m actually hopeful for a Trump policy change I hope this isn t the only time
Lorri Bell	Having been in Healthcare over 35 year and learning pretty much every department this is one of the most inclusive explanation of the current issue
Jay Workman	How doe Trump and his scum family profit from this You know he doesn ’ t do anything unless he get to skim a little off the top Maybe he ’ s hoping the pharma industry will offer him bribe
Troy Stuart	Because it is Trump I imagine Democrats will hate it regardless lol
Scalpymesuse	I think Canada get these advertisement too but it might be because sometimes we watch american channel I m not sure
Alex Rey	I don t think this whole situation would cause drug company to lower their price but it would create competition where if they didn t lower their price they would be losing out on customer
Long Nose Joe	I swear if the market wa more free than it wouldn t have been controlled by these monopoly Its not capitalism it s the lack of commitment to it
Michael Parr	The editing in this wa different with the dot point and stuff I liked it made absorbing the information easier
Tracy Parker	As someone who work in a Pharmacy the dream would be to have these cost lowered so that patient could afford their medication but I can tell you that I don t think this approach is going to work Drug manufacturer don t care because they know that Americans will make purchase if enough scare tactic is used by doctor It is really sad to see patient come in and struggle between getting needed medication or paying a bill or even eating Don t even get me started on the cost of LIFE SAVING drug It cost le to get opioids that it doe medication needed to breathe
Sench	Well those all sound like swell idea How about 5 Educating people about the drug they take and that the majority are not at all necessary and many are not even helpful before taking potential side effect into account Big pharma ha hammered into many people s head that if they re not taking drug they re not healthy but that s a complete lie
Frosty Ginger	The pessimistic side of me say that if this becomes a law it will give criminal an opportunity to know what kind of drug are expensive and would target people who have said drug
courtneyblushtg	Should have been longer and covered more topic
JJ C	What in the hell doe any of this have to do with the first amendment
Gavin Reddig	I d take it if I only died for like 5 minute but permanent death is just to risky
Cade Shortt	The rule is no longer open for public comment The information at 4 23 is out of date a of publishing the video
Harlon Thurlo	you know death might be permanent just might be
Kalek Nelson	It s only going to work if there are cheaper alternative
jakethreesixty	I feel like 70 of Americans is a bit alarming How many of them were failed by their doctor or therapist instead of getting help they just throw you on pill and call it a day Taking antidepressant solves nothing
Old Dirty Gamer	Does anyone even watch tv anymore
Capt Biddy	no one watch fucking tv anymore so i will do nothing drug company win when they look like they are losing welcome to corporate america Remember when they boosted the price of inhaler and insulin by like 300
Anthony Gonzalez	Law pass Drug Companies OK then Puts price in the tiniest fine print possible to the point that virtually no one can read it
Jeannette W	Or y all could stop advertising drug The public aren t doctor and don t diagnose or prescribe these conditions\meds So wtf do they need an ad So they can self diagnose and ask a doctor to prescribe and Pfizer get a boner Ugh I hate this pill for everything culture And of course my stupid as got into pharmacy Literally applying for factory job rn co I hate myself for being a part of this scam for 20 year Faaaaaaaack
CrazyRandomzZ	coma or death a these may become permanent well no shit Sherlock Watson you ve got it
As Always	WHAT Death is a permanent side affect
Grumble Dore	Death may be permanent Grandma Gladius just read about Jesus
Weabe	Of fucking course the Drug company don t want transparency lol Surprised NOT
Frank Rankin	If you have to ask the price you afford it
DaOneJoel	Yo hit like we need this
Robin Morgan	Are sure this is from Trump I m shocked really
Joshua Cooke	Prescribed by betterhelp what do I do
Brandon Watkins	Yeah I m shocked that the Trump Administration is putting this through also yes I like this morning video format
GothSaidWhat	I work at a paint store Obviously we have to display the shelf price of our product in store and more often than not they are more expensive than our competitor due to quality We often are asked about our price and so we discus with every single individual customer how we match price and offer discount to people who spend a minute of their time to set up an account and that we have sale a few time a month Sure it get repetitive and yeah at first people think our price are too high but 99 time out of 100 the customer actually save money Lots of people s discount are different too so we have to spend the time going into their account and going over price with them a we explore their option Having shelf or market price available up front HELPS the consumer and while it take time to explain pricing to them we do so on a case by case business because that s literally part of our job If this proposed plan go through pharmaceutical company are just going to have to suck it up and get on other business level I don t know how many time I or someone I know ended up refusing medication because it turned out to be too expensive This will help a lot
E.I.E ANIMATIONS	why didn t we jump right into it
Cierra Foley	I d love to see this happen Big pharma ha needed major pricing overhaul Though I think insurance company have a big hand in it a well hopefully this kind of law would end up being drafted well enough to be a good first step towards making perscriptions more affordable
lucidity910	Does anyone really need a drug that s being advertised on TV
Shamelesscritique1	I m english and I haven t watched tv in a very long time literally removing my antenna and telling the BBC license harasser to fuck right off but from what I can remember we don t or didn t have drug company advertising on TV or at least I never saw any it not only feel tacky and exploitative but like an obvious scam Watching a lot of them it s like the modern version of those old wild west tonic and elixir being sold by travelling con artist where said miracle cure contained cocaine opium high dos of mercury and arsenic etc warning may cause addiction madness and or death which may be permanent
Brennan Beyer	I am surprised but I want it to be for all pharmaceutical advertising
Joe Schmo	Why am i paying 260 dollar for my adhd med and 200 dollar for my bi polar med help me phil i work 60 hour a week and have to choose between medication or food and im 26
Meet Vora	Good job trump
Quentin Styger	They can put the base cost and mention that insurance policy will change the cost to customer Non compliance punishment need to hurt in order to be effective I don t put my hand on a hot stove because it hurt if it tickled I d probably put other body part on the hot stove
Raeda Masri	Wow I am actually impressed that Trump would advocate for patient
Izzy	Wooo Morning show
a Nurchin	Wow the production value of this video seemed might higher than usual I don t even live in America but it wa great to watch
EmmySweden92	Yaaaay Loving this
mitchelle245	I glad the government is taking the approach of informing consumer This way basic economic principle come into play and I a a consumer can elect to take my dollar elsewhere This will also force doctor to explore and be aware of alternative so they can have informative discussion with their patient To often the doctor writes you a script and you blindly get it filled only to be shocked at the drugstore counter This is a minimally intrusive way for the government to effect change a opposed to stepping in with an even heavier hand
tapo00	thats just crazy the fact you have ad for prescription drug why you dont choose what drug a doctor prescribes to you well in Ireland we dont you get what the doc think will help best
henry wright	yay New Zealand got a mention
sOMeBoDy important	This is actually one of the few thing the trump administration ha proposed that I actually want Price transparency is so important and drug company I feel would have to lower their price if competition increased If insurance is such a big issue just say price are subject to change depending on insurance It s not that hard
snakedude61	Maybe I m thinking about it too much but with Healthcare being such a Hot Topic going into the midterm It look like they just want to talk and point That I don t really think would change much of anything Especially with thing like NAFTA 2 0 Extending the length of time drug company can hold a patent on their drug Eliminating generic for longer I don t think they really care they just want to talk and point for the midterm As a last ditch for the couple extra vote What are they going to say It could cost between 5 and 500 depending on your insurance Ask your doctor about bulshit medication today I don t think it ll really matter We all already know they re expensive and it depends on your insurance
hummercat14	I m a person who ha a really large stake in this outcome and I honestly feel that this is a non issue I don t think this will effect drug company or consumer very much either way I have a chronic autoimmune disease for which I have two medication and drug infusion which are very very very expensive And I am a biomedical engineer who ha worked on manufacturing of drug in large Pharma company The flaw in this argument is that this rhetoric is saying that the person taking the drug is the customer of the pharma company but that is not the case at all The customer for prescription drug is the doctor You don t decide what drug you take your doctor doe with knowledge of your financials and insurance situation In almost all case these expensive drug will give you a rebate back for the cost because the cost are made with the assumption that insurance company are paying for most of it I think the real problem that could be addressed is the drug company advertising to the doctor If a company want to sell more of their drug they need doctor on their side There are ethical way to do this by providing study and documentation and the like but unethical way like giving gift and kickback for prescribing more of their drug There are rule in the business for this already but there are always loophole Addressing this issue will most help the consumer because the doctor is the advocate for what is best for the patient in this case and they should be making that decision with no outside influence Whew hope that help
Spriggz	Ok good job Trump administration Credit where credit is due Hopefully this help lower price
Mahaveez	Death is permanent Is this a rogue like is this just fantasy
Joshua Short	Just a proposal before mid term to make sure that big pharma remembers to make their donation This is a flex on big pharma that doesn t really matter but it just a nudge to the lobbyist It s just extortion from Trump Admin to big pharma They know that dem s are slightly more likely to make law that would regulate them and cost them more in profit So this is Trump Admin saying Bitch Pay Me or I ll show you the devil you know
Gewsfrahba	I mean the goal of this all is great but I don t see how it change anything I think most people know that drug are expensive and if other doctor are like mine they suggest cheaper alternative anyway
XXXPread	Forget “ better help ” I ’ ll be “ better pharmacy ” if you want anything dm me 🌚🌚🌚
Peter Jarl	Video showed on my homepage but not my subscription Weird
Kanakine Shiro	As someone who ha just started taking medicine last month I would love to know how much my medicine would cost before I get to the pharmacy I got hit with a rather large price that I wa not anticipating and it made me consider not taking medicine even though I truly need it It would be great if price came down but I honestly don ’ t ever see that happening
Jess izthebess	Yay a Morning Show
Rebecca Loptson	4 35 fine seriously you don t know how breaking the rule would be enforced
Daniel Luna	moar morn n vidz ples
The No Life Gamer	Phill me in PAPA
Jack Dillons	What is going on I tap my screen for le than half a second and all the suddon I m a 3rd of the way through the coments
Heather Noelle	That ’ s pretty great
Lizzie Phebus	I wasn t expecting this and woke up to it made my morning
Jacob Dowdle	Lol good time to go to bed
Couch Lord1	I can see why it s a complicated topic There are 6 possible price a person may have to pay the advertised drug could possibly be covered entirely or partially by their insurance or they might have to pay out of pocket if their insurance doesn t cover it or they have no insurance Then that advterised drug may have a generic brand version that could also either be covered or not by insurance Then let s not forget they can start to use misleading sale tactic like the classic TV sale pitch normally drug Y cost X amount but you can pick it up now for Z amount Hard for me to take a stance since I m only 22 year old and healthy so I don t buy med yet
KyleCorbeau	4 12 Can anyone explain to me how this requirement would run against the First Amendment in any way The Constitution is in regard to people not company Companies have very different right and law than individual citizen that make them up so bringing up citizen s right in this regard is incredibly confusing to me
ericsiggins1007	The advertising requirement will just push the pharmaceutical industry to advertise where they don ’ t have to show the price
Nect	That s a fairly early morning right there
Farrakhan Wolcott	What infringing on freedom of speech for tell people price hahaha
Kenny1594	Least they are trying something Drug company are evil by nature Look at the opioid situation A drug turn normal people into drug addict You think the medication will help and it doe way more harm then good
Ch0pSticks	Wait America ha tv ad for prescription drug Lol that ’ s so absurd to me A tv ad is something that should generate interest in a product which sound pointless for something like prescription drug It isn ’ t like you wake up one day and want a certain drug because you saw it on tv Ads are more suited for general consumer product and not prescribed drug
DOAM1234	Telfast Australia ad Lmao drug
Kivutar Kisat	Pharmaceuticals are outrageous with and without insurance They re kind of like tollways You re supposed to pay off the cost of making them eventually but the owner always coming up with another reason why the price need to go up
james wylie	Great video PhillyD Maybe there is a light at the end of this dark as tunnel
cfcaitlin15	Simply advertising the price can be extremely misleading Not just the price changing based on insurance and other coverage program but there ’ s a lot of research that go into long term price so putting competitor drug head to head in study and showing ok X drug is cheaper but people who took X drug v Y drug ended up in the hospital 15 more than people who took drug Y Which can lead to long term cost these often time are not simple transaction like CPG these price based decision can have long term consequence and the average consumer is not educated enough to know that going in
kewe box	but orange man bad
Grant Hernandez	I never realized death wa permanent
Paul Garcia	The Pharmaceutical company that say there are different price for the same drug is the same thing a when car are advertised They list their price but depending on the dealer you can get the car for a lower price
Asphalt Pilgrim	70 have at least one prescription in the US AYFKM
TheCure	Right before midterm Seems like trump i calculating or more like a smart person at lest is calculating
Bill de Iturrondo	I think that advertising drug is contributing to the high price and would prefer that it stop all together
Smiley McCabe	This tell me trump is probably not personally nor is his family invested in the pharmeseudical industry
cavingincolorado	This is totally what I expect from a republican mindset They would totally think a person would have totally have the mind set that medication is a luxury item I don ’ t take medication because I want too I take it because I have too It ’ s death or pay That ’ s not a supply and demand workable scenario
glasco61	WUT SEVENTY precent on at least one prescription drug I m pretty sure UK won t be far off of that But DAMN that is a real shock
princekelsey95	I thought it wa a little early for this video to be posted
Tony Pee	But the main issue is still the same those pharma company still shoving all those drug down American throat
jason dirt	I don t think it would matter This law will change nothing
chris chao	In nz we get 5 prescription medicine and thats the total cost of the prescription no extra
vinny9500	How about we just follow the rest of the world and make law that ban the drug advertisement all together Most of the money from these exorbitant drug price go to advertisement and the CEO shareholder pocket Very little of it go into research and development a most company claim
Ravaeron	As someone who is not from the USA I can honestly say I d be terrified to be in a position in which I need drug or healthcare over in your country More and more I get the feeling that if you either 1 Are not born into a comfortable uppermiddle class family or 2 Spend all your time and effort into a backbreaking job you re basically screwed and perhaps even those are not a guarantee False or misleading advertising is just a symptom of the system that allow predatory behaviour it seems Obviously I get most if not all information on these system through news show documentary and website and never first hand so I could be terribly wrong but thats my viewpoint In the Netherlands where I m from most if not all mainline drug operation and other healthcare are taken care of in exchange for a monthly paid fee to a healthcare insurance company while alternative medication and treatment come from your own pocket Just to provide some perspective
Erick Almeida	It would be a crime if we don t get these morning show Phil It s great is what I m saying
Sam Haines	Alright what s the catch
Hot Mess Ness	Hell yes more morning video I need those for my morning coffee I ve actually been concerned for my mother who requires a few prescription drug and the cost to which I believe she should pay nothing because she s retired and her SSD only give get so much a month She life with me my husband and kid because the can t afford to live on her own So I m intrigued to see what happens and what this could mean for her
Adele Etherton	My husband take one of the drug you have shown At our Medicare discounted rate it is 258 a month There is no other drug that ha worked for him and before retirement the drug company wa letting u have the drug for 50 a month With le money coming in and we are on Medicare they will not let u have that price because we are involved in a government agency OH MY WORD unbelievable We have paid into Social Security since I wa 13 year old till I am 69 and now I am i Involved WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY I have called the drug company on three separate occasion and they will not give u grace on this drug We pay it and drive an older vehicle and are getting by but I certainly do not know for how long And there is no competition for this drug all they have to do is change one thing and then it can not become generic Don t even get me started Anything anyone can do would be an improvement Let s try this P S May cause death
BJlovesTech	You forgot the best side effect evahhh Anal seepage 👌😂😂😂😂
Andrew Conlan	doe shelf price even exist in America
Bigeast Starlight	I think this is a pretty good attempt at some more transparency from the pharma industry But I don t think it should be limited to tv commercial Those rule should apply across all medium It s only when le people are using traditional tv doe this plan start so it feel like limiting it to tv only isn t transparent enough
Nick Barnett	Yea This is just painting rust It look good for midterm but really isn t going to fix anything Who still watch Cheap TV or ha cable They only require the price on TV and not the other way they advertise Social medium hit more people than a commercial If I where these company I would continue migrating away from TV commercial focusing on social medium I don t think this is going to spur more competition just more very deceptive and targeted ad This is just a midterm smoke screen just like the tax cut congress who is recessed for the midterm is working before the midterm so say ole tiny hand himself
Vaping Moderation	Give the MSM a few hour today to tell u why this is exactly what Hitler would have done
Furan Orbit	all I know is my schizo med dont make me feel any better and I m glad I don t need to pay for them smoke doobius
Archecard	New show idea Good Morning DeFranco
ishattered.ghosts	Personally I dont think so There s a huge difference between how the car industry work and the medicine industry work Mainly because with car you dont really need expensive car because there are already cheaper car albeit still a high price that already meet your need While a with medicine there s really no other alternative with the medicine and you really need the drug to improve your health at least that s what i think Though I would like to see some people prove my point wrong and if there s flaw in my argument please point it out politely I m very excited with this kind of discussion mainly because it touch a bit of economics
Light Monolith	MORE MORNING VIDS
Brittany Conway	Love this morning video Super informative I had no idea this wa going on right now
Luke Clough	lol the T Admin Takes a positive universal stand on Pharma Drug law in this Country Ok I ’ m let ’ s see how the left opposes should be interesting
Grant LeVasseur	Definitely not a Republican but I m glad the Trump admin is at least attempting to move in the right direction here This is a good idea the consumer need all the protection they can get from big pharma
Sandy Mitchell-Bayona	As a medical insurance analyst with pharmacy technician experience the most disgusting part of this video is the idea there is amain lobbying group for the drug industry called PhRMA Think about that for a second lobbyist were originally created a a go between for citizen to reach out to their representative Instead of a Congress person or Senator receiving hundred of phone call directly in regard to the same issue the lobbyist would receive those call compile issue that were most important and then present them at one meeting Originally lobbyist s salary were paid for by the member of Congress or the Senate who wanted to utilize their service but thankfully big business stepped in and offered to cover the cost of those salary That happened in the early eighty anyone else remember what happened then That s when Reagan wa introduced to the idea of the trickle down theory Yup lobbyist that were hired by big business gave the idea to our representative that if large cooperation s were to get large tax cut they could then share their profit to their employee like smaller mom and pa store did Notice I said they COULD not would have to that wa never a law So even though they could and especially since they SHOULD our larger company took advantage of those tax break and kept all the money a profit for themselves and their share holder This is why their aren t any more ma and pa electronics store or clothing store or vacuum store Walmart put them out of business Large pharmacy chain like CVS Walgreens and Rite Aid put all the local pharmacy s out of business and that is why price gouging is happening now These store have the money to order drug at such a high price and since insurance company will reimburse and customer will pay those cost their is no down side BTW most of the medication you are prescribed are unnecessary if your doctor would research natural way to heal such a a chiropractor instead of a spinal fusion or eating healthy to keep weight down and finally stretching every day is a great way to reduce injury to your joint therefore needing le pain killer wouldn t that be good to stop the opiod problem we have All of this is known outside the US but here we are so concerned with a free market that we literally make people sick just to sell them harmful drug Wow there is so much more I can say but I ll leave you with this do your research What you are being told is not the truth Uninsured patient were not causing a money drain on insurance company Doctors were not double billing on patient that had insurance they can t the way their contract are set up with the insurance This wa another lobbyist group trying to confuse u citizen and convince our representative to pas law that FORCED u to buy their product Don t drink the kool aid do your research
Alex F.	As a pharmacy student it s hard to look at the pharmacy company and think that they are doing good While many researcher have good intention it s very hard to believe that the company themselves aren t trying to make a much money a possible Take the EpiPen for example In response to losing their patent on their drug and a generic being formulated the price of epipen skyrocketed Is this because pharmacy company think of the good of the people Definitely not There are many who raise the price to the point where most of their consumer can still afford to pay for the drug but just barely I took my PCAT and had my writing portion on this topic and made a good score so
Space Duck	It s too damn early Phil go back to sleep holy shit
JokoCi	Americans relationship with drug is completely fucked up to begin with If 70 take drug than 50 of them do it without any legitimate reason to begin with I think doctor need to be explained the hippocratic oath
JVYSAP 117	Love this Awesome to be able to hear an interesting story in the morning Keep it coming
justblush april	Who else recites the intro and outro with Philip
Tyz The Phoenix	Since my sub randomly clear all the video away I ’ m glad out of the 2 video that are still in my feed this wa one
dpark	death only may be permanent who knew
Ringo 1	More morning video please 😀
Matt McCaskey	I think it s insane that medication is advertised like any consumer product When I go to the doctor I want him to prescribe the best medication for whatever my condition is not whatever medication he s getting the biggest kick back for prescribing Health care should be about making people healthier not lining the pocket of big pharma and corrupt doctor
Niallisim	Holy shit my country got a shout out
Leigha Mercer	It seems like everyday something new come to light that make me hate the Trump Administration more and more but this would be amazing for u It ’ s a huge turn around from the greed that we ’ re always shown
Holo Faydren	Always love an extra dose of news from you
Virtueman1	I heard A Tzar instead of Azar but it turn out that the meaning is the same
Robert Morin	I think this would be a good thing I ’ m not sure it would cause them to lower price but I ’ m all for the consumer getting more information about thing that are being lifestyle advertised on tv also couldn ’ t pharmaceutical company mention that the price to the consumer could vary based on insurance in the commercial a well when they mention the price or something to that extent
Emerson Best	Got a BetterHelp ad before this video 10 10 guy
Hannah Bernal	Oh wow when you say morning you mean MORNING Lol I ’ m rarely up this early but I appreciate having something to watch
JorgeFabrizio	Oh shit If the government negotiates price that s a massive step towards lowering the cost of healthcare
AllKage	So so early phil appreciate the hard work
Max Perkinson	Even here in New Zealand the ad we get are for those cold and fever Lemsip type drink and cough sore throat lozenge and that s absolutely nothing compared to you guy in America
Torchmanz	The fact that Phil had to put this in his gon na be demonitized by Youtube morning segment is VERY sad This kind of news is extremely important to everyone 70 plus percent of people that watch YouTube have some kind of prescription drug they take Wake up YouTube your AI is bullshit and broken to say the least and it killing real creator on your site
SafariPilot	Funny how the rest of the world get along with hardly any prescription
XiterCifer	Why do people advertise drug Shouldn t doctor prescribe you the medicine idk it doesn t seem right
Monica B	It would be nice to know ahead of time if a medication is going to be super expensive and save the trip call to your doctor to ask for a cheaper medication
Mandurath	How many people actually watch television though Seems more and more are watching TV alternative Those alternative are not covered by this rule it seems
neonswift	How you fix it ban drug advertising Simply a that really
michelle collins	Does not affect everyone I ’ m sure I ’ m not your only international subscriber 😛
Matthew Hunt	Thanks for the morning video Good way to wake up I do believe that all medication should be listed with their uninsured price because even if you have insurance you don t know if you are covered for that specific drug That will at a minimum give consumer the knowledge and chance to prepare for those type of expense before hand or even seek our generic version if possible My monthly prescription change price sometimes when we switch healthcare provider or plan change usually yearly and I m never sure what my inhaler is going to cost next year
jack riff	Good job President Trump
TheVerucAssault	Interesting Interesting that this would come from the Trump era too
trapexit	How would these help with price How about removing government subsidy to their business How about just asking about price like every other product How about getting 3rd party payment system out of the system so cost are not externialized Fewer not more regulation is necessary
LordVader1094	Should I really care though
BG GAMING!	£££ For prescription drug lol not in the uk
Claire	Does this affect me in Australia
Dabi	Holy hell this is something the Trump administration is trying to do that I actually supportn if this pas good job
Ghost Grandma	As a Norwegian I think it s ridiculous how USA drug are sold Yes talking to your doctor about pain is good but don t he know more about what you need than a random TV ad Just seems so super shady to me and yes I know some doctor are in the pocket of drug company but still
Loken Lok	Just having prescription drug advertisement alone is all kind of messed up hay buy this drug even though you weren t consulted by your gp no wonder the US ha such a massive opioid crisis xD crazy
Ken Williamson	Love the morning show Phil great way to start the day It would be hard to give a price for the drug because pharmacy all charge different amount It would be nice if it wa all the same no matter where you purchased it
xcuteyetx	Thanks Phil
kendall Dayton	I think the fact that the administration is even approaching the drug company is amazing I go to 2 diffrent pharmacy every month for my medication And in the past 5 year ive only seen it rise I hope they succeed
XGambit139	This morning show is awesome Big fan
kilsync	Another reason to get up in the morning D
MrHaloswrath	Good
kris bob	Can you please talk about the transgender right situation going on right now As an LGBT person I feel that more people need to know what s going on with human right Thanks
Griff Saur	My dad and my grandma both heavily rely on medication for their daily life hearing that there is potential for those drug price to go down in any margin is music to my ear
ce neblock	Yeah my concern is about the First Amendment with showing the price Personally I d rather they be banned from airing As noted in the study there ha been a very large increase and my concern is that medicine is no longer between the patient and the physician but instead the drug company and the the consumer
James Wise Magic	If death isn t becoming permanent for you we have a bigger problem than the prescription drug price We are in the midst of a zombie Apocalypse
Legendary King	Iam dream or is Trump finally doing some good
Dominic Caciappo	I wonder how libs are going to spin this against trump this is actually a pretty good thing
MrBrokenazs	I enjoy the morning show It feel like one of the best change in the last year or 2 Keep up the good work
SomeBritishDude	Or and this may sound crazy stop pharmaceutical company from advertising altogether Just don t do it like the rest of the world I don t get why the US ha to be the exception to every rule in the western world
J Menz	Keep up the good work I feel like ur our generation Walter Cronkite
Nichlas Alenius	If the drug company argue that this will lead to confusion then it their own fault for making confusing ad Just add a Your price may vary depending on insurance plan after saying the price Its not that hard
Kelsea Altman	As a medical assistant who work with primarily medicaid and medicare patient I know that often the name brand prescription aren t covered until patient fail trial of two or more similar medication and generic version of the same medication Commercial insurance is another game entirely and varies plan by plan so it can be a nightmare trying to figure out what is covered and how to get thing covered through prior authorization I think this is a step in the right direction because I ve had patient who say they want name brand medication only and refuse generic but then get mad at the doctor for prescribing a 1000 medication Companies and the government usually put out annually updated formulary for covered med but those aren t always accurate and aren t always easy to access The only way to know how much a prescription will cost out of pocket for a patient is for the pharmacy to run it through the insurance on file and patient don t like being slammed with a high price at the checkout counter Companies like GoodRx have started some competition with cash pay price but I can t wait for the day pharmaceutical company finally lower price appropriately and truly take the average patient into consideration
Gabo LongQua	the editing reminds me of PragerU and it make my skin crawl
Sniperfuchs	This whole thing is insane Lower price Great But doctor should be the one deciding which prescription drug is best not the patient Who thought this wa a good idea This is the equivalent of a house being on fire but instead of putting it out you are adding some flower to the garden to make this mess look prettier
Aslan Hoskin	morning lol
Crystal Sipp	Big pharma really need to be taken down a peg I ’ m surprised this is happening during the Trump era but I have my doubt that Trump actually care abt this rather than the guy who proposed it
KOSS800	I live in Italy and I can hear leftist head exploding from here Trump administration pushing an anti big corporation pro consumer law “ BOOM
Moreganplease	I ’ m happy the Trump administration is trying something here to lower drug price Our healthcare system is ridiculously expensive and any step to fix that is great Whether this will actually be effective I don ’ t know but it ’ s something Also I am not generally a trump supporter but I ’ m not going to find a way to hate on everything he doe if he doe something I think is good then I will call it just like when I think he doe something bad
Cody Columbia	Is Better help word blacklisted Can anyone see this
bless up	i didnt know when you said morning video you meant MORNING morning lol
Ramen Dragon	Anytime I hear pharmaceutical news I still think of Martin Shkreli
Chad Dougherty	I think the advertisement should have the billing price written but say what a typical out of pocket cost the individual
Gracey Gonzalez	getting Phil ’ d in first thing in the morning hell yes 👏🏼
DatGrunt	This is good right But they should also make these requirement applicable online A lot of people dont watch TV I don t watch TV There should be more transparency online a well Big pharma can cry me a river
MrFester	This Is not going to change anything in the long term Watch this and learn where the money really is watch v YQZ2UeOTO3I
SunnyZ	MAH PHARAMA ABUSE MONIES How dare people be accurately informed about the cost of their drug This is only the tip of the ice burg hospital DRASTICALLY overprice the most mundane shit this constant money gouging against public health ha to end
Bee Wilson	Anytime I see a commercial for new medication I think of Kat Williams Did you experience fucked up side effect from this pill Call 1 800 OUR BADD
steph dcc	I think the law will help consumer find alternative rather than pricy med but it doesn t solve the main issue that we have in American which is overpriced medication
Rob Proctor	This could be a double edged sword I like the idea of lower priced medicine But that also mean more consumer if it doesn t cost a much more people will purchase them and do we really need more people on medication I mean sure there is a lot of legit med and if those go down in price great but if this lead to Oxycotton selling for next to nothing it s gon na be a nightmare
Chris Boscawen	more keep vids coming
Laura Baumgartner	It s going to be hard to lower drug price to the consumer if the government doesn t address the extremely high cost of getting drug approved through the FDA Pharmaceutical company need to make money some how and increasing price to the consumer is how they achieve that The FDA ha also never been fully funded to do what they are delegated to do There are a lot of factor that go into the price of prescription drug One last note your pharmacist is NOT the same a the pharmaceutical industry or your insurance company so if you don t like the price of your medication do not yell at them HAPPY PHARMACY MONTH
alejandro palacios moreno	i like this type of video but i feel they are suited more for maria or danny instead of the normal show
Sara B	Thank you for the morning news It wa really nice to wake up to this
intraVRt	As an Aussie travelling through US the majority of ad I saw were for pill I spent most time in Florida if that make sense
LT. SJW Leon Davis	Beware the side effect if they re being given to the elderly The side effect can lower their immune system and possibly kill them
Andrew Fogg	It sound good but I work in insurance and one of the biggest shock I deal with each month is looking at ingredient cost for prescription R D account for over 85 of prescription cost and those cost are projected to rise 50 in the next 2 3 year The over prescribing of specialty drug over equally effective multipurpose drug that cost significantly le is another driver of cost that should be stopped So no I don ’ t think putting the price in an advertisement will do anything to reduce price but I did enjoy the quick morning show
Michael Scott	TL DR don ’ t list the price Ban the commercial a a whole My thing is this I agree with the argument that there will be confusion I work in medical directly with the coding and billing aspect There is so much to how patient get billed for anything you have to take a 3000 course to be certified for it Because copays and deductible play such a huge role in how a customer pay it ’ s ridiculous However being in the position I ’ m in these same medicine company come straight to the office to try and advertise straight to the doctor themselves And doctor are in most case the expert on what a person should take medically There ’ s no need to advertise on TV because your doctor is already being advertised to directly from a drug representative Ban the commercial
Crazy Buttboarding Guy	All my med are covered and I dont have to pay shit Come to Canada guy we will take care of ya
Rj Bruce	Loving the new workflow and editing of this video Definitely a higher production value than before prop Looking forward to the coming video this week My thought on the topic of the video I think regardless of whether or not it cause pharma to lower the price of drug the price transparency is a necessity To me it seems pro consumer and add a layer of accountability to the pharmaceutical industry that doesn t exist a of yet
DoorisJ	Ya know if they just legalized marijuana we could all heal and not need any drug
Prazed Platoon	My first mourning show Jesus can t believe this is my first mourning of being Philed In
TheStackeddeck77	Hmmmm if a competitor had an ad for the same drug it may work to lower price just because there will be direct competition but at the end of the day transparency is a good enough reason to do this And wtf is this the government may not even be able to do anything we live in a country where everything that is not banned is permitted that is apart of english law and it is why our 10th amendment exists it wa made to mirror that law and allow anything not banned Now that doe apply to the people and I would assume to the government too thats why we put restriction in place instead of allowences for the gov t So really our government should be able to do anything then the people decide if it is correct or misguided
Tokin	Ya ll act like doctor dont look at you like a drug addict when you ask question and actually know about the drug you are about to consume You act like doctor in America actually listen to you You act like this isn t exactly what they say to you This is how I am going to treat this and walk out of the room with no conversation
woods ivan	Trump really is fighting for the little guy
MysticMarble	Just a reminder to the Importance of Voting NOVEMBER 6TH The 🌊 DEMOCRATS 🌊 will CRUSH the Republican cancer that wrapped itself around this nation
Wabbit -tan	Um Canada ha these ad too And Canada isn ’ t part of the USA so there ’ s 3 country then
WafflyNimb	I got a feeling that there will soon be a vacant position for Secretary of Health and Human Services
TBouvier	I don ’ t seen anything wrong with the drug company being transparent by displaying their prices— will it hurt them Not really but at least people can see what they ’ re paying for Personally I think it ’ s all a ripe off for those who seriously need the medication to live or die shouldn ’ t cost you everything you have
spritewon	For once the Trump administration is doing something good
Moriganne M.	I say GOOD these company have gotten away with too much for too long
Stelios Koutroulelis	I m so glad they cleared up that their drug can cause permanent death I thought I wa going to have to deal with intermittent death
SAmB	More expensive drug may be seen a more premium too Who want 2 anti depressant when you have a premium 50 brand
david581s04	Feels very strange to hear about something positive the Trump administration is proposing Wish there wa more news like this
Luana B	Shame them into lower price You are talking about the company that got everyone addicted to opiate I don t see them a having shame
Taye Nic	I think a website would be better no But only in properly directed there Websites could be interactive They can have a list of price via insurance company someone to talk to if you have immediate question abt the product And besides it not like the watcher would always have to get up and go to a computer to look it up People have smart phone smart tv etc
Tenebras	I always thought the biggest joke about America is the fact that their eating habit are ridiculous and that they are all armed But advertisement for prescription drug Thats fucking insane patient aren t supposed to decide what drug they take doctor do that You don t take drug to function better you take drug to make life bearable while you are healing this practice make it look like drug are enhancement for a person to choose Prescription drug are no joke they should be avoided if possible
AJ Warner	There ha to be another reason Trump administration is doing this Not just cuz they re conservative but because they re politician There s no way their end goal is to lower drug price way too much power in that industry to let that happen
nemobla1	I v been to US once and the first thing that hit me when watching TV there were all these STUPID MORONIC commercial about all these different drug for this and that And my friend and i had alot of fun about that they spent more time warning about their shit than actually advertiseing it
TeaEarlGrey	Drug industry will just throw hundred of million in bribe Nothing will change 60 day worth of greasing palm will do wonder for them I am surprised that the Trump admin is doing this though seems too friendly towards average people Something is up maybe a smoke screen to get the drug industry to start throwing more money their way then they ll cave type of plan
Stalker Bleach	Does anyone actually decide to use a drug based off those shitty tv add
Edgard Pinheiro	I will say something that I really dont say much often Congratulation on the Trump administration
Curtis Swingell	Whenever I see anything healthcare related come from the US I m thankful I live in the UK Luckily I don t suffer from anything that requires surgery medicine etc like at all I get a cold maybe three time a year and that s it But I know if I ever require healthcare I won t ever struggle to afford it
Gamer Voice	He need some milk 🍼
MrYoop	I woke up just for this
calichef1962	If drug company are going to advertise directly to consumer I want all drug price CLEARLY posted for the duration of the ad AND announced in ALL pharmaceutical ad I don t care if it s on TV radio online magazine newspaper billboard or anywhere else ANY DRUG prescription or OTC is advertised I don t care if it s Theraflu or Harvoni People NEED to know And they need to announce when there is a sudden stiff hike or series of hike in any drug s price It s easy A 30 capsule prescription of Fuketall is available for 89 95 at pharmacy everywhere Price stated is full uninsured price your health insurance may cover some if not all of the cost Fuketall historical price were 59 95 in 2017 and 9 84 in 2012 Pharmaceutical company may cite their reason for price hike but it MUST be factual
Briana Leslie	I ll add a more insightful comment on the actual content once I ve woken up but I have to say that the graphic editing lately look spiffy af
von Darkmoor	Thank you for the extra morning video it pair well with my morning coffee I hope this becomes a regular thing
Elyse Winch	Liking this new editing style for the text portion of your video look awesome
Riley Andrews	It s fascinating that out of all presidentential administration that Trump is pushing for cheaper perscription drug He s always been supportive of Big anything As a person who at the moment is uninsured it s exciting to hear something about lowering price The total for my monthly amount of medication is 400 for 2 generic brand asthma medication It s insanity but you know I ll believe it when I see it
Tigersofgul	Whoa animation
Nathaniel pittman	im glad you are trying the morning show again love it keep it up
Russell Souder	Love the morning video I love the regular pd too but since the morning video is one story it feel like I m getting more out of it I know the same amount of work go into all the news you talk about but it just feel like I get more this way Not to mention you being able to single out a story that sometimes normally might get you flagged and still be able to talk about it
J. Scott Holt	How much wa paid for this pharma ad
Casey W.	Who watch commercial anyway I feel like this is just a minor stupid thing Trump is pushing so he can brag nonstop about how wonderful he is especially when trying to get reelected Just a smokescreen in my admittedly biased opinion 😉
Michael Hedges	Medication profit should be capped at 10 over production cost
Frank Zolchak	The more information a consumer ha is all the better Unfortunately a lot of people will be against this because Trump like the idea
Chilly Jack	Damn Trump and his racist consumer advocacy
J Fraulo	I get into work and there ’ s new Philly D Today ’ s gon na be a good day
Matthew leffel	Love just a little info in the morning on something that I didn ’ t bother following Probably should have with my pile of subscription Thanks for the morning back Phil
Priyank sonwani	U guy sure do love ur pill
subsidedanimal	Morning show at 2030 Love it
Terran Qualls	rubbing eye Good morning 💤💤
Raistlin Majere	The scarier thing about those Ads is when and where their placed right smack between 12 am to 6pm on most broadcast station They target the eldery trying to scam them out of their money slamming them on Channels like T V Land or Me T V
Will Scarangello	This wa your best video yet Love the format and how the information is presented Thanks Phil
Prisim Drone	it is true that drug price vary on the person insurance maybe they can have a link in the ad for people to goto if on pc or handheld device look up TV that will be a page that people can check the actual price with the insurance they have
openning	I think this is a great thing And just to be clear in this polarized political climate I am decidedly NOT a fan of Trump but I think this is a fantastic thing and so credit where credit is due Consumers should be informed The pharma company are correct though in that the cost of drug will vary with insurance yet another reason for a national insurance program but I think this could easily be solved by coming to an agreed standard between all the company for how to calculate price of course this would have to be agreed upon first and they would have to be held to it I would assume they would chose a standard that would give them the lowest price possible which is still fine because if the standard wa the same across the board it would still allow for comparison
Yarek-Karey	Omg I love this When a new PDS drop I always wait until the next day so I can watch it a my morning news digest This morning show is exactly what I need in my life
David Dellsperger	I think this is a good step in the right direction but really only affect drug who advertise on TV etc Specifically this doesn t hit the company that Azar used to work for Eli Lily because they don t advertise their 1 money making drug on TV at all As a user of that drug which currently cost me about 2500 out of pocket monthly luckily my insurance cover it it likely won t have the impact that is desired if anything I think more of those company will move away from advertising on TV which I welcome simply because they can be le transparent with other mean If they really want to fix this they need to force people to have the price on all marketing material and if on TV Radio or any audio based advertising they must speak it I am hopeful that some of the other thing pointed out like the US government being able to negotiate price down will become more of a realistic goal that medication that I take would cost me about 225 a month in just about any other country in the world
katie g	a an australian i find the fact you guy even have ad on tv like this wild let alone can put ad for medication in print or digital medium it literally so suggestive to some people who would see an ad and go oh i can tick those box i might need it then again we arent allowed to have codeine without a script over here anymore
Skyler B	The whole pharmaceutical industry need to be overhauled No more ad punishment for ridiculous price inflation of old drug and more government regulation on these ethically bankrupt company I am totally against government regulation in most case but these drug company are out of control
BlweLotus	There is literally nothing better than this in the morning Thank God for being on the east coast
killernat	please call your doctor if you have coma or death ill get right on that
Moni B	Interesting Thinking about it I only remember price being said for fast food such a 2 for 5 auto and a seen on TV product
SlimThrull	Forcing company to say what the price for their product doe violate the first amendment However those right do not exist in a vacuum I m all for this I have doubt that it will do much to lower price but I do think that once big pharma know that it s day of hiking price for no good reason are coming to an end we will see drug price go up slower This is new regulation that I m for That say something because I m usually very opposed to regulation
Blue Pig Gaming	Big pharma can suck it
Beth Ann E	The face that those drug company are so against this transparency lead me to believe that they really don t have the consumer best interest in mind with their worry about price confusion Also so happy to come home from work to find you posted another video greeting from Beijing
Inspiring Thought	Those ad are a classic example of manipulation
Yakal-6	It s 8 pm in south korea but thx anyway
Bearded Wonder Youngblood	Only tv add tho
drhilltube	That s cool I wa up anyway and this is good news
Lexer Grande	Yaaaayyy Morning video are back
S PACE	READ the book Undoctored You will never take drug again if you can avoid it Written by a Doctor
Zilla Films	Where i live the doctor will just proscribed really strong addictive painkiller to anyone who come in and send them out My brother got really addicted and later found out they had him on much too high a dose but they never took any responsibility for it at all it s disgusting how easly they hand out pill like sweet
Das	I like the idea of advertising the price but my concern is that some people who really need the medication will opt to not take the medication or even see a doctor because of the price
ImaginedIntrovert	Well I wa gon na sleep but
equesdeventusoccasus	I said it before and it received around 1000 like you should make this a regular thing and make the morning show world news We would likely still watch both but viewer who really only want one or the other can get what they want
shadow librarian	This is a good move that the Trump Administration is taking these Pharmaceutical ad need to be way more transparent
Amanda Desens	I dont even see why there an argument Insurance only lower the price for consumer That s not a valid argument that s saying hey this is wrong because people could already have the price cheaper Not everyone dy permanently but drug company still mentioned that I m confused on what the problem is because you dont even have to reshoot your commercial You have to re edit them That s it If we dont try to change it how will we know Simple economics say that if a price is too high demand will lower Then when price lower demand will be high
B C	This won t largely affect drug price because already many doctor actively consider the cheaper alternative generic There is a reason why only your country ha drgg advertisement It s not for patient benefit
iceman4154	Trump is so good a negotiation lmao He released his plan to fuck big pharma and instantly they are freezing price increase and becoming more transparent Such a genius
Brynn Lemoine	all the animation and such were a really cool addition
Joshiah Phillips	i am a pharmacy technician in CVS and our thing for saving money is putting the generic brand by default The doctor or the patient would have to request for the name brand so I heavily doubt that it bc of the name brand prescription for why the cost of prescription spending is so high I personally believe that it because of the longer life expectancy and increasing population size of the senior citizen which is a big part to blame for the increased spending There were not nearly a many old people nor a many medication which people could buy This seems like an attack for the wrong reason But i am still happy to see more transparency in the pharmaceutical industry
Lemon Tang	Only for Americans
Zechairah McKenzie	Woke up just had my coffee so watching this is a treat I appreciate the extra content Phil
Harry Senior	I ’ m sorry you guy won ’ t to make prescription drug one of the number one killer in the u cheaper are you nut
Robert Stoll	It isn t far enough it s only for TV and still with a ton of loophole It s suprising Trump is doing this but it obvious who exactly he s doing it for the fox news audience Who the hell see drug ad on television otherwise
Jaz Alvarez	Has anyone else noticed the editing and the visuals are a lot cleaner and more professional Like when he wa listing the proposal I love it and am here for it
Insanegaz	How do you contact them if you end up in a coma or death becomes permanent
Tdld77	Well at least they re giving it a shot going against those bastard
Cloud Nine	Morning Show Literally 12 28am
Jig	coma or death a these might become permanent wtf here I wa thinking that death wasn t permanent fml
Leo Ambermane	I like the idea but I am skeptical on the implementation The drug company do have a point that not everyone pay the same price and would cause confusion I am not sure that shaming is also appropriate As a matter of transparency I do work for a major hospital chain
Charles D	Thanks Phil for the info I can ’ t help but feel like the administration is doing a bellhop delayed goodbye after offloading your luggage Of course not to u but to big pharma Call me a pessimist but this may fall under the if it ’ s too good to be true it probable is category
johanskoglund	They said that Trump would be a dead duck president who spent most of his time on vacation but he actually getting thing done with speed and alot of them are good stuff His election promise are being crossed one by one which I doubt Clinton would
John Herrera	Getting that PHILLY D in the early morning now
Adrian VanRassel	I woke up with a hang over and saw the PDS at 6AM Am I still sleeping
Steve Smith	I m skeptical if something like that would make company lower price on prescription but at least if they do something like that people will not be surprised by the pricing
JohnTheGuy	Philip DeMorningshow
BIG NIBBA	Oh look big Pharma only give a damn about money what a surprise Lol
S H	A republican must have been burned on the price of viagra and got his fellow old men in Congress to agree and request change
ATs Channel	5 for 60 Adderalls let ’ s keep it that way
TheMrbloem3000	Here s some honest feedback I like the one topic per video format and the graphic showing the list of item while you were listing them If the video stay ad roll free the length of the outro is fine otherwise I would shorten it to keep a nice ratio of content to stuff I don t care about In any case keep up the good work
BlaineTog	Wait wait wait wait just one durned minute This doesn t actually sound like an apocalypticly bad idea And the Trump administration is pushing it This might be the craziest news of 2018
Samuelle Saindon	Looove these morning show Phil
A.J. Olsen	I ’ m in a pharmacy class becoming a tech and some drug are so expensive because it take year to get approved so they get a patent for a certain amount of time so if there ’ s a new drug then a cheaper alternative won ’ t be available And everyone ’ s insurance is different so putting the price won ’ t be the amount everyone pay
Emile van der Merwe	We have add for some over the counter medication in my country but I ve seen your add and there s something erie about them I cant help but feel uncomfortable while watching them
Josh Maddux	Is that 70 for normal prescription or one time off for surgery etc I would like to know how many of those are for diabetes antibiotic for surgery etc and not long term drug
fspsyco1	the only good thing about waking up at 4 am every day
Edenn C	Phil WHAT so early
wantafry	As someone with a chronic illness I ’ d love to see more transparency in medication ad I don ’ t see how listing the price in the ad would deter someone from getting needed medicine If they have insurance they know they ’ ll likely get a lower price And the competition introduced would make my life easier considering my illness will be with me forever I ’ m not a fan of the Trump administration but this look like a step in the right direction and if I see it happen then he ha gained a bit of respect from me
Ricky Williams	A bill that would encourage competition amongst pharma company Of course these company are going to fight it
Fluffy Willson	Canada ha those advertisement too it ’ s not just Canada and New Zealand
Flash Frame	I mean this idea is at least an idea I can t think of many other way we could attempt to hit big pharma in any meaningful way other than a complete overhaul of the insurance system But seeing a how that s hugely unlikely I dunno maybe the administration is on the right track here I m hesitant but hopeful
Hamburger Chef	drug should cure people why poison in them
Masen H	One of the few time I like when the government interferes in the economy is when they attempt to boost competition Competition lower price and tends to lead to innovation
Smash-ter	Okay one of the good thing this administration is doing
Faizah Mohammed Aruwa	No Philip we shall NOT talk about my prescription drug Thank you very much
Chaos Miner	All aboard the motherfucking trump train
ChaosKitchen	It s nice to hear good news coming out of the Trump administration I very much support this and what is trying to be done though shit are they going to have a fight on their hand against Big Pharma
Julia Nell	This is extremely smart I went in to my doctor looking to change my birth control after seeing an Ad but the new drug wa over 300 for one month
David Vasquez	Hey insomniac it ’ s me Ya boi
Bible Illustrated	Those commercial are real I thought they were just parody in the Simpsons
Nicole Starr	I have 3 prescription sometimes 4 an antibiotic to treat acne I ’ m on and off of two of those are over 100 and we didn ’ t know that until we showed up to the pharmacy The third and the sometimes 4th is free because the third is birth control and the fourth is a generic brand but I have to pick it up every two week
Alex FRD	Donald Trump want to take on the pharmaceutical industry Good luck
SportingRedwood	“ Call your doctor if death becomes permanent ” SIGN ME UP
That Aussie Guy	Love the late night show Bout time a US late show wa available in Australia
Hansel And Gretel	Takes Meds while watching this video Oh oops
Nautical Soap	Anyone think that the policy the trump administration are enacting are strange This one is a latest in a course of them I mean it s not something I expected trump to do but I m not sure how I feel about it While pharmaceutical company should disclose price more often on commercial the way the law just came to effect wa very sudden almost a if there wa little warning or prep time for company or people to be informed of this I m unsure a if this wa spoken about before in news or medium but this is the first I hear of it While I think people should informed sudden and seemingly forced change to company could tilt company to favor filing dispute like Phill mentioned a they would feel at risk of losing their business I guess we d have to see how this go
Skitnit2	Rx drug have ALWAYS been a last resort for me personally I don t even take Tylenol unless I m in agony Instead of running to pharma at the hint of an issue talking to your Dr about reasonable and obviously non threatening alternative mean of a cure should be a part of the treatment plan
Rya N	F big pharma
smgofdvld	the amount of people that spend a shit ton on prescription drug and have to use them due to medical reason is really scary 😨 good on this hopefully it take a few buck away from big pharma
BlueFan99	I don t usually support Trump but this is a good step forward
Gordy Luft	Big for Trump s administration Between this and the NAFTA restructuring Trump is finally doing something besides antagonizing shit on Twitter
Cesar Dedios	Whoever edited this show I hope they stay away from the regular show not a fan how this wa edited just my opinion
thoughtlesskills	Great now legislate the ad away all together
Kyle Magaro	Well this is a bit early
arandomwasteoftime	I personally find this to be something needed and I hope it happens Not only will it open a discussion with patient and doctor about possible alternative medicine but at least give a ball park estimate or legitimate pricing on how much it will cost to use the life saving drug you need It would have saved me a lot of heartache and 8 000 this past year if my doctor or the pharmaceutical company were open about the cost of my medicine So now I m in debt and still in pain
Kai	This is the best news I ve heard in a while The government need to be allowed to negotiate with price because the pharmaceutical industry is too powerful and I hope this ha some affect on drug price and lead to greater change in the future
Cristina M	I m interested to see how this play out I work in pharmacy and there are definitely patient who come in to ask our thought on new med they saw in an ad before talking to their doctor They ask for pricing side effect interaction with current treatment etc I see potential for this to be confusing but also very beneficial Having more transparency on the cash price of a med is certainly helpful Many people with insurance have high deductible or if they have Medicare the donut hole where they are responsible for a higher percent of the cost of the medication until a certain dollar amount is paid So knowing how expensive a medicine is at cash value will help them better decide if they can budget it
The Fire King	The phermacudical company are wild with their excuse It might confuse costumer because price may vary depending on their insurance Then then tell them that in the ad
Escape Reality	Wow I can t believe I m saying this trump administration 👍👌
cetriya's Art n Comics Channel	I don t really need them to list of price l eventually find out what I really care about is having an appropriate list of competitor and Effectiveness rate
HeyThisIsRya	I sell prescription drug policy to Medicare recipient for my day job This is huge news One of the biggest thing that affect people I speak with daily is called the donut hole Once someone s medication cost certain amount for the year they pay more for their prescription until they re out of pocket cost total around 5 000 That is not unique to my company that is written right into the legislation of Medicare regulated drug plan for any company Legislation ha been reducing the donut hole year over year but people don t realize that those cost then get past back to recipient The cost of policy are going up next year and no one is happy about it my heart break that we have a system where some people are only getting 1 000 a month for their fixed income but have to pay almost half of that just to cover their prescription
Maddy DeVeuve	I m all for lowering the price Just not entirely sure that if this pass it will actually get company to lower their price I do still think the price should be displayed on the ad anyways though for transparency
Adrian Smith	You guy in the U S have access to a large quantity of prescription medication not available in other country like Australia for example but you guy are paying through the teeth for all of your medication most of ours are subsidied by the government which make it much more affordable I hope for your sake this move brings the cost down so you guy can get the medication you need without worrying about also not being able to afford other living expense
eggstoastbeans	The sacrifice is worth it phil You don t need sanity when you have u
Welcome To My Channel	Phil whoever on your team edited this give them a raise and a hug Fantastic
Xylon Hurst	Very surprised and pleased by this move from the Trump administration Very pro consumer when it would be all too easy to take the lobbyist money
Xzygy	They re also trying to legally define gender a immutable which is troubling
RonVandeil	Shaming is a good policy

maverickhunterzero20	I love this format it ’ s an impactful and important story that I think needed the 5 minute where a it might get a couple or a mention in the full PDS due to higher priority news volume Thanks PDS Team 👍💪🔥
In No Particular Order	Extra Philip DeFranco is the best ra Philip DeFranco
Alyssa Hoe	the morning show Phil i ’ m in Buffalo NY and it ’ s the as crack of dawn lol which mean it is hardly “ the morning show ” on your side of the country lmao love it though more video the better 😘

MediusMajere	This story wa just strange What happened to evidence based decision Oh right Trump Never mind 😂
MetalGearSEAL4	I have doubt on that plan I don t believe ad have anything to do with american spending more on drug I feel like it just ha to do with the drug being more costlier a time go on
Andrew McNulty	Insomniac here great time slot today
Kyozoku Kyokyokuu	I try to give credit where it s due even if it s the fucking Trump administration and I think this is a step in the right direction I think more than a shame list is needed but it s a start Actually I think we need to stop allowing direct to consumer advertising But again Baby step
rahl163	Know what Trump and his administration doe this they will have done exactly one thing I can wholesale approve of
Giffica	Will the left admit trump saved America yet
William Torres	This policy would lower drug price and will lower the cost of healthcare If they ’ re required to show price of their competitor they ’ re going to have to make their price look more appealing than their competitor At the same time if you show me a price that I see is too expensive I ’ m not going to buy that particular drug regardless of whether or not I suffer from the condition The erroneous part is that pharmaceutical are saying that I ’ m not going to buy a drug to deal with my condition I definitely will I had the condition and I ’ m going to want to treat it What ’ s going to happen is generic more affordable alternative will be purchased more which will force bigger company with higher price to figure out how to compete and so on and so forth The idea behind capitalism is that there ’ s a free market economy that would regulate pricing because of competition Right now Only the company that are already doing well can afford to advertise so essentially their competition is drastically reduced The other thing that need to be addressed a well is requiring doctor to disclose when they ’ re being paid or sponsored by a pharmaceutical company the same way that youtubers have to disclose it If my doctor is telling me about an alternative to the drug I heard about on tv he should have to tell me if the alternative he ’ s giving me is paying him to do it
Ricky Strasser	First no one ever pay the list price of a drug Not wholesaler not pharmacy and certainly not patient There are a lot of contract in place that negotiate different price between manufacturer wholesaler and pharmacy There are also thousand of insurance drug plan that cover drug at different rate Second most of the drug that have ad don ’ t have a generic i e don ’ t have a competitor They are the still on patent and a generic biosimilar can not be produced until that patent expires You can ’ t post a price of a competitor if competitor don ’ t exist That ’ s all I got Listing pricing is a good idea in theory but would not help much since that ’ s not the real price
Zant	Death may become permanent guy
Wyser Wiler	Yes Lower the price Too many people are dying in this World because they can not afford medical treatment wither it be just prescription drug or anything else
LionByTheChurch	More Philly D is always a good thing I could get very used to these morning tid bit
Alice Dubois	Phil You KNOW we love morning show why are you even asking ❤❤❤ good morning everyone
oppai	Good morning Remember to drink water
Eli Eeee	Honestly I think it is a good idea if anything it won ’ t cause drug price to rise so what ’ s the harm
K Hendrickson	The President of the pharmaceutical lobbying group look like a pompous as
Ursula McSoriley	Okay so about NZ drug advertising in New Zealand it mostly just asthma hayfever and viagra type medication that are advertised and usually only feature during daytime tv And when you bring it up with your DR they will probably just prescribe the generic that is funded by pharmac so that a 3 month supply cost you like 5 Yes we have prescription ad but it very different to the state
Jack Ryan	I love the new morning video It s perfect for me I usually try to watch something before I leave the house usually it s political commentary by Steven Crowder or other producer but I like the idea of getting some good news from PhillyD in the morning
Harvey Brown	Fuck yes morning show
Gouravager	Canada approves
Latina Broadway Lover	Death may be permanent
Spectre	Huh Didn t know that about u and America with the advertising
Mike madness Top Comment Cleanup Crew For Health	You da man trump
Keith Kanz	If people need a drug then their doctor will prescribe them Pharma company are not people They dont have human right
Zeikxx	My friend on the left told me I should oppose this because of the orange man being bad
Jaime Resendiz	Philly in the morning 👍
Teacher Tornholm	Well this is good news From a European point of view I ’ ve always been surprised by the commercial that are allowed in America Political ad for kid and pharmacy commercial
DRUNKARD	Trump ha already done more for me than Obama or Bush ever did If he doe this then it ll be official Best President Ever
pieman22	I m genuily happy about this news The Obama administration did recognize the right problem but pursued the wrong solution The affordable health care issue had not much to do with insurance but on the pricing of health care in general med general care and emergency care if the current or future administration could address or regulate these pricing issue we wont need to pursue a semi flawed system of universal health care because a 1 25 iv bag would cost 5 to a patient not 500
Pickle P	I have this drug that will improve your quality of life or save your life You must pay to receive it What you cant pay Feel free to jump through all the intentional red tape to obtain at a reduced cost Its ok we will still receive our 6 and 7 figure bonus Our investor get paid Whats a little pain and agony or loss of life when it come to profit
JORDAN HAS NO TALENT	Canada ha those ad too but most people should know it usually fugazi
Guerrilla Gaming	I m no fan of the Trump Administration but I have to give credit where it is due This is a game changer
DJ MoistSausage	I ’ m not sure if this will actually do anything but it ’ s a very surprising move by the trump organization and possibly the first thing I fully support can ’ t hurt to try and definitely worth a try considering how ridiculous drug price in the US are
Crockxen Clan	In my opinion they should be added in magazine and newspaper a well When you are in a doctor ’ s office you sometimes read a magazine which could advertiser prescription drug and they might influence an individual to ask about said medication As for newspaper at least where I live they are still handed out at traffic light everyday and they should be taken into consideration
Kay L	It seems like a show more than anything it ha good intention behind it but it wont actually fix anything it on a dying platform although they are considering expanding it to other thing and cable is still popular with people who are older I just feel this entire thing doesnt actually address some of the bigger issue with the industry and seems like they are going to make an image of taking a hard stance against these company while Americans will continue to pay the highest price and company will be able to effectively lobby doctor to push their pill If just a part of sweeping change it a good addition but alone it doesnt really solve anything
speedy01247	Woke up from my first nightmare in year nice that I woke to this video Like in the dream I had finally reached the morning after going through hell of a haunting only to hear a door crack open so I go to check on it and while it wa my dad opening the door opposite the room attached to my room door which had a window with bar on it were two arm hand missing everything else damn it suck a I really need more sleep but I now feel like I won t be getting any
Fox San	Two video in one day Are you Scarce
Dave Morreau	Uncontrollable muscle movement coma or death may become permanent Got ta love the legalese disclaimer
EmilyKate2656	I ’ m definitely surprised at the direction they ’ re taking happily so mostly I figured not much wa going to change for better OR worse regarding rx drug I ’ m really glad it ’ s being talked about but I ’ m worried that it might be rushed into and a better version of the plan may be left in the dust I definitely want to hear more about how they think this will be effective and perhaps talk about a multi step plan involving the other focus on that list I ’ m afraid that the pharmaceutical company are right that people would be dissuaded by seeing price because I actually feel like having ad for the drug is important in America because our healthcare system can make it difficult for people to have regular doctor ’ s appointment during which the doctor can say “ hey this isn ’ t normal let ’ s try you on this drug ” A lot of people are only getting these option from watching these ad Which is a whole other issue but still a factor in how this will play out But also people are dying from not having their drug ANYWAYS because even if they know about it they can ’ t afford it So it might be a case of “ get cost down any way possible ” I just added a new medication to my litany one that is actually more name brand and I think commercialized so I ’ ll be very interested in how this unfolds
Blake long	LOVE the morning video
Coal Dust XIII	For transparency sake this is a great thing As for the last point though I ll take the Washington University law professor position on the pricing I know that people will go after the high price because they think they are getting a higher quality product I m guilty of this myself So the pricing thing is in question
Keyon J	Lol I always would laugh when they have their laughing and having fun while telling you how this drug can kill you
ᕼᗩᘔᗩᖇᗪ	What ’ s up guy scarce here
No Need For Sleep	Woke up at 4 am wa pleasantly surprised by this video
alltowner	I ’ m not sure if it will cause the price to be effected initially but if a generic version advertised at a lower cost it may lead to lower price on the original or give incentive to insurance company to cover more of the cost thereby making it more affordable for consumer My insurance give me Nexium for free because they provide insurance for worker at the company that make the drug even though the initial charge is about 75 The generic version is only 25 and doesn ’ t get a subsidy
Arem Jarem	If putting the price in an ad make the company lower the price then yes it should be mandatory All drug company charge way too much for thier drug And if they are really worried that it will cause confusion they can fix that by adding a disclaimer saying that the price may vary depending on your insurance
armyscout11	Damn wicked early I do not think it will change much of anything at all
Shrey'o'ley !!!	Being Philled in before school 6am here Love ya face Phill
Ian Alvord	Sounds like a good idea Let s just hope it work
anonymousdratini	I wouldn t mind perscriptons being cheaper I don t see how putting the price of the drug will male that happen That will probably just reduce the amount of people taking drug if anything
Morthana Magelight	I think American healthcare need to have a larger focus on more natural healthcare alternative rather than drug that are highly addictive and have a huge amount of negative side effect Drugs should not be a first point of call for every single problem especially when there ’ s more natural alternative that work equally a well or even better In my opinion American doctor should be encouraged to try to avoid drug prescription when there ’ s better alternative that work just a well if not better
Tony Mozzarella	I wa told to comment and like if I wanted to continue to getting Philled in so I did
SirKnobofCheese	Do there have TV ADs for weed may curse 1am munchies
King Head	This is great news
wizard680	I m honestly surprised trump is actually doing regulation
Michael Weston	It s 4am why u posting daddy
Edgar Berlanga	I got some mixed opinion Really the one argument that got to me is about price scaring away those who may need them but then again drug company just have a terrible rep including selling drug that don t really do anything This might be a good change I m not sure
Carlos Molina	Insomnia kicked in and led me to watching a Philly D vid at 4 am Life is getting craaazy
DrevlikDehGamer	ITS 4 15 AM WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP GO TO SLEEP
DARK	Call if you die because it may become permanent
NintendoWolf	It ’ s weird I ’ ve never payed attention to drug commercial to see that weird trend of side effect narrated over happy video
Library Adjacent	My family thought I wa crazy when I heard them list death a an actual fucking side effect Ha I knew I wasn t just hearing thing
ASSASSIN199998	I m surprised by the move and are for it I think some company would lower the price a bit like a few cent or dollar and that s it
amelia tieman	I think it s a good idea for everyone to know how much the prescription is or whatever before the insurance is put into play
Milo Crawford	I like how Pharma s main arguement wa our price are so high people won t want to buy it
N K	Was awake and wanted something to watch on YouTube while I ate cereal Your video popped up on notification Perfect timing
chadoftoons	Hey thats great to see the right side do good i can applaud holding company to good standard and protecting consumer Hey you can even be conservative here and just do it with TV ad first it atleast a step in a good direction Though i also don t think they would not change their price and wonder if thats going to be enough to make them do so
Potgar J	Hello MR Sir woke up early af just for this Vid
Chris Tate	why this early
Jessica Barnum	The thing is a lot of time you have med for example one that I took is a 5000 medication but with the combination of insurance and the drug company offered co pay plan that I renewed once a year I only paid 5 month Yes sticker shock would have stopped me but most doctor work with drug rep to know if it s going to be be costly if their is a copay option before offering it At least that s what my doctor have done
iCkEdMeL	So well put together Thanks for the break down
Alexander B	Being someone who work in Medicare I see this a a good thing However I can already hear people calling me and hollering My drug plan isn t covering the medication the tv said it wa 20 Fix it it s dishonest But so it go got ta take the good with the bad I suppose
Amanda the Jedi	Not American but anything that might make drug manufacturer think twice before arbitrarily raising their price is a good thing The advertisement of drug in America is honestly the most unusual thing
Josh Berut	Ty for the morning show
Mew Ling	I am here too 4am you are not alone
Lainey Bug	This just seems like something inconsequential he picked because he knew they could squable over it for the next x amount of time he s in office so he look like he s fighting them but doesn t actually have to do anything that effectively reform the industry SmokeAndMirrors
Skyy Crews	I m all for this because even if it show the actual price of the drug people will still know what they have to pay depending on their individual insurance plan because math in a thing
Neomi S	I liked this I like hearing Phil talk about stuff his fairly sexy news voice Though a someone who life in the UK I do find it extremely weird that America advertises drug on TV
Michael	This organisation is so weird One minute they re denying downplaying Saudi involvement in Khashoggi s murder and the next they propose consumer protection for drug price
Victor Young	Good morning Phil Thanks for that morning news
Strange Kat	Seems like a good idea Where I live we don t have drug advertised And you pay a fixed price for each prescription or you get it free I have to take quite a few prescription medication so this is quite useful
avgaskoolaid	Jesus Christ Phil it s way too early go back to bed
Ryan Sheridan	I ’ m not sure what to think about this I ’ ve never been a big fan of drug company they seem like a necessary evil to me and forcing them to be more transparent seems like a good thing to me That being said they do bring up a good point that it tougher to broadcast price because insurance company make everything more difficult But on the other hand there is a lot of shady stuff that happens with insurance company and drug company and could be limited with such a rule Idk I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see
Mac Dietz	What product price would be in the ad The actual price which doesnt matter to anyone other the in company or the insurance adjusted price which will obviously vary by plan This seems very stupid Id also like to see what happens when the US the global pharmaceutical pioneer change the way those business conduct themselves to the tune of billion I wonder how fast hong kong or singapore will take our pharma crown a company flee Bring back low level manufacturing so we can lose a quarter trillion dollar a year in gdp Maga
Alexander Pitman	Finally we can learn what a drug is supposed to cost Not the five different cost provided by five different pharmacy
Savannah Kendrick	This is interesting As a young person that take 6 different medication for varying thing a lot I know Im falling apart lol I am always concerned about the price of medication and cheaper alternative My doctor have generally been good about prescribing me thing I can work with my insurance for and it isn t an issue But there have been too many time I have gone in to find they have tried giving me 150 medication without any warning and I just cant do that especially on the spot I like the idea of knowing about cheaper alternative to some drug But this definitely would not change a thing about price in my opinion
WhatAmIDoing	What should happen is they completely ban advertising to consumer and not just to doctor
Andrew Yang	Wait how is this infringing on their first amendment right That just seems like big pharma is trying to use every trick in the book to mislead the public like usual
aztec11	this sound fantastic for consumer
bassmastapr	View 37 Sweet
Mntdewmania	Love the Extra video Well a I take several med honestly I don t know how this would help actually I mean I guess it could be useful to know whats coming but I doubt seriously drug company will lower any price I tend to natural mean first such a Fish Oil Cinnamon and Red Yeast Rice and thing along that line It would be helpful to know more about generic brand though I think that would be very helpful A lot of drug have them but the brand name is all you ever hear about sometimes and most ppl don t know there is a cheaper alternative that can be taken that doe the same job maybe that should be on the ad too
Patrick Burke	always love a bit of transparency
zy2zy4zy	dear gaben 6 am morning show IM GAME
failsrus96	I m not sure if this will do anything but I m just glad now an administration is finally doing something about pharmaceutical company intentionally misleading consumer And with more state planning on voting to either legalize or expand recreational medical marijuana in 2 week it s finally glad to see the pharmaceutical company getting their just dessert
Rainy Day	Before my Gram passed she wa paying 1 400 a month for prescription That wa with her insurance covering some cost Heck 1 400 is more than I pay in rent Half the med she wa taking she probably didn t even need
Richard	Im in au so when you release your evening show i get it in the morning and when you release your morning show ive got it in the evening ITS PERFECT

bryan mollett	Phil can Phil me in any time lol
Hope goes a long way	Why the posting is so early Idk but do I care Nope Yay new video
Jennifer Rodriguez	Seems like a good idea but coming from the Trump administration being so money driven and big business friendly I ’ m afraid there will be some kind of loophole for Phrma where consumer still get the short end of the stick
xMusicx	No you pharma prick show the price without the insurance cost you know the one that just F s everyone over to start with
Leave a like for no reason Please	Is it just me or is the editing a tad bit different
SquallLeonheart	My question is with this is why now iirc it wa pushed during obamas and a few others a well but now they are trying to push this idk it feel like some one who ever it maybe is trying to hide something and i dont like it
xbigEx	What do you mean only America or new Zealand i get these ad all the time and im in Canada and yes they are on Canadian channel
Angus	It s always interesting to see the perspective a an outsider to the US To me even the thought about marketing prescription drug in TV is mind boggling I heard in other video that most people go to the doctor saying they want a prescription for a drug they saw on TV I m not sure but it s possible that doctor s earn a bit by writing prescription so that would be a motivating factor In my opinion the doctor should decide for you which drug are necessary and to go through side effect etc This marketing kinda circumvents the prescription concept
Zoha Baig	I 100 think having the price in the ad is the right way to go It would allow people to make more informed decision on what drug they buy and ultimately change the market If it cause demand to go down for a drug that ll lower the price and make the drug more accessible More competition is ALWAYS a good thing
Derby Reeves	It ’ s 4 AM in LA and I ’ ve never been more confused but happy to see a Phil video at this hour
Red Shift Rider	Please cover the IPCC report on global warming
Miss Kevonni	Prices should be listed in commercial Maybe it will discourage people from using them
Anna Murray	Just in time for my commute to work
Ryan Edwards	I m all for this I don t like that these premium brand can cost upwards of hundred of dollar but the generic version of the drug work just a well My inhaler can cost over a thousand dollar and although I have insurance to cover most of it it s just not right
joe poole	As a neutral from these video the trump administration seems to be doing quite well despite the fact that they are hated
xander rice	I ’ ve never had a commercial dictate what drug i should use i usually have that discussion with my doctor If anything doctor should have to divulge that information up front and discus alternative solution to different brand Hospitals and insurance company decide what med you go on not commercial

OmnomRanger	I feel like a lot of health insurance cover the bulk cost of medication mine doe and this might not effect a many people purchasing the product a one would think I don ’ t have any prescription however but whenever I do have to buy one it ’ s never more than 20 because my health carrier cover the rest unless I ’ m mistaken

Jonathan Odude	Literally every other country can do this you get the price and if you have insurance you know you wont pay the full thing and then you ask your insurance how much it will cover dunno why these company think Americans are dumber than every other country citizen and cant determine whether their insurance will cover them or not

Erin Vititoe	I would not expect this from the Trump Administration but I have to say I love this idea I hope it becomes a law We have a big problem with the entire medical industry taking advantage of people because of the mystery behind the cost of everything Laying out the price first thing in advertisement will help so many people and ha a high chance of helping to increase competition which is honestly what the entire drug industry need more of
