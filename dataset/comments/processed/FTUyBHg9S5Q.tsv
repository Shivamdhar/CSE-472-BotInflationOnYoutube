Hawkesey11	Is it just me but is Triple H s ego out of control His promo s are cringe He love biggin himself up Someone should show him clip of dx in 1997 They mock and make fun of the older wrestle at that time who are passed there best Yet here we are 2018 watching an old dx

Ahmad Jadoon	😭😭😭 Roman Miss u
Andy Hackett	This is perfect timing for Ambrose to turn heel It creates further intrigue for one of the top 2 headlining story on RAW Maybe the reasoning can be linked to Roman leaving and Dean losing his mind over it
umar naik	i pray roman become healthy
Jeeva V. Jeeva	i miss u roman
Rooty Rootyson	Can we stop harping on about Bayley and Sasha being low on the card Those two are established star and they are getting good visibility week in week out You can t possibly grow a woman s division by having a couple of performer monopolise the title scene for year With the limited match slot afforded them this is the only sensible way to broaden the talent pool to a point the WWE might actually feel it s proftiable to put more woman s wrestling content out there
Megan Lambert	Mr The jobber Really
rockthahouse1	I think Ambrose turning heel wa perfect timing Made it really go over a a complete jerk type of heel I think most week Dean still get cheered but last night it really pushed it through a an asshole move
للعشق جنون شيفاي انيكا	ليش ي رومان رينز المصارعه بدونك وعع 😭😭😭💔💔
World is topper	Roman ne agar WWE chori to Kia hoa Kun ke WWE is faie
Reece Bender	imo it the best time for dean to turn fully in kayfaybe he distrought and emotionally unstable because of his friend being struck down by an illness he doesnt know what to do and it could be said he upset by it and doesnt want to be around seth reminding him of roman pain and also that roman cancer could be a i need to take my chance because life can go at any time thing he came back from his surgury buff a a fuck and looking strong before he left he took brock to the limit now he back i hope they let him go a step further and have a serious title run and some time at the top v braun seth drew and brock he the perfect guy to allow the scene to step away from monster without them being beaten in gimmicky way by smaller guy seth beating brock or braun would look weird seth beating dean or drew after they take out brock braun would be a good way to transition it though i think seth need to be on smackdown no matter what happens he too good to be ragdolled by Big Sweaty Men™
epickithri	I would give the Dean heel turn an F The Shield won the Tag title for Roman Reigns who now down for another bout with Leukaemia The remaining shield brother would have been huge face that could have been pushed hard and would have really won over the crowd and sold a ton of merch a a dominant Tag team champ They look now like instead someone who could lose the belt to a pair of jobber It s just way too soon to break the shield up
Bacon Tomato	I went to a live event on Sunday night and they had lio rush push finn off the rope when he wa going for the coup de grace I much preferred the Dq win to what he had monday

anushiya shankar	Get well soon we miss u roman 😨 😨 😨
ValdoVlogger96	The timing wa perfect
combatinfantry008	First and foremost cancer can get the F out Joe Roman Reigns is a great man ambassador for the WWE Not a fan of the character but a fan if the man same a Cena However though done amazingly shouldn t the turn of Dean waited until oh I don t know at least a week after they won the tag title What do they even mean now Are Seth and Dean going to team up and defend them Couldn t they have had them get wrecked by AOP next week and then had Dean turn The emotion wa great for the wrong reason the portrayal wa amazing the story is just rushed in a way that make no sense Why would Dean turn when they needed to lean on each other Why after they just won the belt which they promised to do Where wa the logic Once again screw cancer See you in the ring before too long Roman
HeelNattans	The fan have pretty much everything they ve been doing cannon now Owens is face Braun is face Elias is face Lashley is heel Roman is gone the character not the person Now all we need is a Sasha heel turn
Anju Kumari	get well soon roman
puropinchemikey	Roman reign fan hit like
The Memer	Was it an Elias babyface turn though
Auritra Dey	Roman will be back to rock soon
Kristian179	I mean it make sense a now people can really hate and have a reason to hate Dean Ambrose a a heel
Ryan Pollock	So they are the champ but will be feuding interesting
Kaden L	5 18
John Marston	If WWE think I m taking a break from RDR2 for Evolution then they are sorely mistaken
Abrax 23	No one is talking about the way HHH ran over the last remnant of kayfabe with a monster truck during his promo making direct reference to Kane being the mayor of Knox County So all that history of the Kane character from his first appearance a Taker s mysterious brother to all the background story that wa played out over the course of many feud Fuck all that say HHH let s just toss it all away and totally break the 4th wall destroying the credibility of a beloved character in the process Yay Oh and let s mock the Brothers of Destruction s choice of venue for their promo too made by the very company that HHH is the COO of So what is this feud now Four guy that have been around so long that the very integrity of the nature wrestling is at stake That s going to be the added stipulation just before the match start at Crown Jewel Vince Russo will come out and declare This match is now for the very concept of kayfabe If the Brothers of Destruction lose then it will no longer be possible for the entire WWE roster to use their in ring name
Dark Hawk	I try to keep these comment clean but F k Cancer I don t know the man and likely will never meet him but any time I ve seen him out of character like on UpUpDownDown or doing the charity work He just seems like a great chill guy The fact he s been living with this for 11 year apparently Explains why he s always there when they do the Connor s Cure promotion That promo messed me up and seeing Seth cry when he came out messed me up more Take care of yourself Joe we ll see you when you beat this thing
issac lopez	thankyouromea
William Iron	I hate Roman Reigns and I hate the way WWE is now It s like a fucking cartoon show
urianthefatmansgreat	Was it too soon No First off that crowd reaction wa perfect We ve all speculated for month that he wa going to turn and he did it when nobody saw it coming Combine that with his and Seth s performance during the beat down and it wa perfect Second I d rather have them do something that will showcase both of them than have them do some odd 2 3 shield run that devalues the intercontinental title
Nick Baker	Alexa retweeted a promotional tweet for her fight so I don ’ t think she ’ s injured
Deuce Treyz	2 3 year for average treatment
Ernest Wert	I have a theory about the recent 50 50 booking It s all your fault Not your a in Jack s fault I mean everyone who think they re smart and who think they know everything about wrestling WE prof to you each and every time you stand there scratching your head and wondering why the fuck did they book it so stupidly that they are unpredictable and that they are exciting Also another theory ROMAN REIGNS IS FUCKING WORKING YOU LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN Can t you see it it s the ultimate grasp of WE for making Roman likeable let s give him a fucking cancer and hope people will feel sad and clap for him repackage him a the GOD in 2 week when he come back with Leukemia s Heavyweight Title and make him win the entire Wrestlemania Fucking mark
Foxgames 539	thankyouroman
Flying Toaster	Dean still hold a grudge against Seth Rollins for what he did when he betrayed The Shield But he wa loyal to Roman and fought alongside Rollins for his sake With Roman gone there wa nothing left to attach him to Seth and so he turned on him
Jose Theragood	With Roman gone expect the WWE to burn through all the internet fan theory and fantasy booking all the wrestler that need a push will get a little faux push and all the dream match will happen but they will just be shite so they can be gotten out of the way
Louis Campbell	This wa the best raw in age I wa really losing interest these last few week but this wa a great episode
Bearded Nerd SheDanigans	I personally think that wa the smartest and possibly the only way to turn Dean and get the fan to actually boo him Everyone know if they turn him any other time it ’ d be a Becky situation
Der Punkrockpazifist	Guys it´s time to change the Becky Picture with an angry Becky picture
Dz Drak Media	Hope roman reign will come back 💗♥💗 Love from Kerala
Noel Halyard	Elias turn face drama turn heel This wa the best RAW in year
Peter Fleming	It ’ s an amazing heel turn and I ’ m sure Roman would have given them the thumb up to go for it and have a tremendous feud until he get back
Shaik Ayaz	I miss you roman
Mr.Otaku2399	the BIG DAWG is gon na beat cancer and comeback a the true super hero vince always wanted him to be ThankYouRoman
Fuck Wizkhalifa	I deadass had to fast forward through the ending cause it wa so hard to watch
Milan Suvajac	Only RAW this year to deserve an A
Jesus Munoz	If I know Roman reign he kick out at 1
MH Creed	I mean it s kinda the best time for dean to get heat right
Steve Smith	That make a lot of sense The show must go on Well it s to soon to turn Dean Fucking IWC
MrGreyfu	As soon a Roman said My name is Joe my stomach wa just in the pit and I knew straight away it wa worse than an injury A real oh for fuck sake moment Adversley at the end the evening when Dean go off on Seth I had a pretty hard laugh I knew it wa the worst night to do something like this in kayfabe but Rene shouting that disapproving hey when Dean hit the dirty deed on Seth just had me howling I wonder if the announce team knew it wa coming
Sam Mort	I think the heel turn wa perfect I thought from the build beforehand if he turned it ’ d be too obvious but after he won the tag title and reign promo nobody expected it that night Pissed people off Perfect
Franky Bernal	this episode of raw felt bigger than it had in year i feel this will go down a an era defining episode
Bob Tallman	I hope Roman get well soon but it really helped give creative a hard reset that they needed Braun face Elias face Dean heel Things are moving in the right direction Wonder how Renee is going to handle commentary when Dean is in the ring
zman2748	the best raw in a long time
Bikrama Yadav	I can t explain my emotio 😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Tyler Gomola	It seems I m in the minority but i think Dean s turn is a bad move Heel Ambrose is boring in my opinion And turning right after winning the title is telegraphing them dropping the title in the first defense thankyouroman
Ron Hathorne	What a terrible situation it ’ s like this Vince “ I wish Roman Reigns could get over a a babyface ” WWE Universe “ We wish Roman would drop the title ” Monkey ’ s Paw “ Hold my beer ” GetWellRoman
cool manxd	WHAAAAATCULTRE
Macephtopheles	I d say the Dean heel turn wa perfectly timed I think doing it not only after the emotional Roman Joe promo but also immediately after winning the tag title made the timing even better because it wasn t expected Like ANY other time and you d have people saying it wa obviously coming too predictable but if anyone say they saw it coming after that promo then they re just lying so to me I d say that s what made it perfectly timed
MikeMcc 19	I wa there and everyone wa cheering Dean Ambrose Do idk if WWE changed it on tv but the whole arena gave him a huge pop
Shaü-aü Phom	This wa heavy
sunny Talukdar	Oh allah plz save roman
Grayhound	never really thought about this but is Jack Mr the jobber because Ross is king
Jeff Gordon	A few amazing moment 1 When Michael Cole said Not tonight After Ambrose s DDT 2 After getting DDT D Seth Looking at Dean and saying It s okay 3 The fan saying Why man why Probably one of the most impacful bit of storytelling from the main roster show I ve seen in a while
roman reings	Sun never set on roman empire come back soon
animesoul167	Yes it wa too soon to turn and thats why it work Its the most evil thing
Imran Khan	No Roman
Larry 35	I don t mean a single bit of disrespectful intent I pray for Roman and hope he beat this and come back That said It took cancer to turn this man Babyface Vince ha been one upped by reality that or Vince is literally God and took drastic measure to get him over
Colin Lynn	ThankYouRoman
LEGENDARY & EPIC	Alicia Fox looked so Hot last night dayme
Pauladin	I agree that we need more Woman Stories beyond playground bitching but with the Bella Twins that fit their character perfectly They play the mean girl role great
Himanshu Sinha	loved the backstage video of roman with a lot of the other wrestler and wwe personnel specially paul heyman and braun
Md Jabed	Get well soon Roman love u🤙🤙🤙🤙
JURASSICDANGEROUS DINOSAUR	Regardless to how you feel for roman he deserves respect for doing this I really hope he pull through THE BIG DOG
riselikethephoenix1	With roman out i would think vince would want lashley to look dominant and add him to the main event of crown jewel Weve seen lesnar v strowman We have NOT seen lesnar v strowman v lashley
Dylan Piazza	it not too soon guarantee Roman is fine with it He know the business so do Dean and Seth and it been coming for a while anyway it wa good timing if anything Ive always loved Roman never been one of the nerd hating on him for thing he cant control and i still liked the heel turn a lot Love thought an prayer out to Joe and his family though all thing wrestling aside
Christopher Lawrence	I honestly don ’ t think it ’ s too soon If you asked Roman from a story telling standpoint he would be all in for it I thought it wa brilliant My only concern is what title will be on the show next week Hypothetically Seth should be hurt the tag champ are broken up and the Universal title is vacant
DSTY Boys	Heel and face turn galore What a better than average episode of RAW I dont wish to be rude and feel free to dislike if you disagree but i hope they ever so slightly incorporate roman s leave of absence with dean heel turn
Mark Orr II	In what time or in what spot could Ambrose had gotten better heat nowhere and never this vacates the tag title for possibly AOP and widens the main event scene
Ben Warner	The correct answer is that it ’ s an A grade
CapHowdy	It wa perfect timing for the turn I am sure all three men gave the go ahead for this WWE have already failed with Becky and her heel turn so to do this now take away any risk of fan not accepting Dean turning How else do you make the fan hate Dean this much As Roman said thing do not stop the show need to go on With the fact that Seth and Dean are also tag champ now just add even more to what wa a stroke of genius in regard to timing In fact the announcement by Roman would naturally probably make Dean even more unstable so yeah perfect timing in my eye Even the most die hard Roman hater know this is Joe now and are showing their support of him And with a more long view on this a far a Roman go If he doe indeed get over this it is probably the one thing that will actually get him over a the 1 baby face Kinda shitty that
Justin S	Jack Roman s shocking announcement Dean s shocking heel turn Elias turn face Heymans great promo DX in the house and you give it a B ARE YOU SERIOUS BRO
Jason Busch	Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins have more chemistry with each other than anyone on the main roster
brian6502	It wa not too soon for Dean to turn The show must go on and and that it did once the first segment went to commercial
Stairwell Toronto	Jack shamelessly plugging his merch is why he ’ s great
Adnan Malik	Rip tag title
Billy Purdue	Dean Ambrose heel turn wa perfect it now make him the biggest heel in wrestling and show he never had the problem with Roman he just had the problem with Seth
ayanna bertrand	I believe Dean s heel turn wa perfect timing Who expected it last night of all night Thought the crowd s response really legitimized it
Josh Reidy	Ambrose turn wa perfect if they left it and did it later we would have seen it coming
The Ghost of Teddy Long	Is it sad that I d much rather see Balor v Rush
Mark Armour	I ’ m so sad Roman ha had to leave for a while I hope he get better soon but I feel this will be an exciting time for RAW and Seth for Universal Champ let him hold all the make title on RAW
Samuel Linkous	All the horsewoman should be on Smackdown
amillo01	When Roman come back hopefully soon he should come back more casual like last night
sourodeep ghosh	thank you roman
Steven Kelly	You better believe there ’ s gon na be one fucking hell of a pop when he return like imagine it He deserves the pop in my opinion
xMKxUltra	I think Roman wa suppose to be the one who would hold the Shield together He wa the glue Now that he ’ s gone what is the point in pretending to be 2 3 of the Shield The timing is savage and I applaud them for it Dean and Seth will prolly happen at Mania along with the IC title
Jake Dennison	I ’ ve made it no secret how I feel about Roman Reigns the Character in the past But I like hopefully EVERYONE else can differentiate wrestling from Real life If you believe it prayer definitely pray Everyone is wishing for a speedy recovery
James Davis	Opening segment get an F As in FUCK you cancer Speedy recovery Roman Can ’ t wait to start booing you again
Dysart Demon Dad	Definitely not a Roman fan but I hope he kick cancer as When he doe return WWE will then have their Roman baby face they always wanted How could you boo a guy who beat cancer
sidra naz	don t woryy everything will be alright
Vernon Loyed	NOT too soon People have been expecting it for week Placing the heel turn on this show wa when no one expected it By next week people would ve started talking about it again It wa not too soon it wa PERFECT
Shane Fagan	I d say they wanted to build Balor a bit to have a top babyface underdog
Kapricorn71	Get well soon Roman kickcancersass
Rueben McFadden	I think it wa the perfect time he ha been itching to not be with the shield for a while and this wa just the right time for it I feel this heel turn will get it more into the John Moxley persona Might see some more extreme fight from him if we are really lucky
teccosman	I hope Roman let wwe use this in a storyline
Pallen	I actually think there wa no better time to turn dean heel If you want to establish a proper heel and get him hated then last night wa the perfect time from a storyline perspective to do it
Hugh Alabaster	Reigns is going to beat leukemia at mania 35 after 1 spear Believe That
Tyler Leggett	Im not a Paul Heymen guy but his promo last night wa incredible
Jonathan J Mitchell	Hope Roman ha a full recovery and come back ThankYouRoman
Angel Carballo	At first I wa against Dean turning heel but after watching it again I agree it give Dean so much proper Heat after the whole Roman situation and their emotional win it also fit well with his character
Jagdish Bharvad	nice
DrLipkin	I don t think Elias turned face I think it wa a one time thing because of the event of the night
kilala plush	Get Well Soon Joe ☹😢
The Negan Guy	Get well soon Joe ThankYouRoman anyway to RAW it wa good B for me my only negative is Finn v Bobby and then Ronda and Bella twin promo wa a let down
Pentarax	Weird thought babyface Elias show up with an electric guitar
Jake Pearl	Typical Roman putting a downer on RAW
Mad Maximoff	A few take aways about the heel turn It happened in the same building where Jake the Snake Roberts DDT ed Ricky the Dragon Steamboat onto the concrete Dean being the massive Jake mark that he is not only delivered Dirty Deeds on the concrete a double arm DDT he said I told you this would happen Trust Me before delivering it a line Jake delivered when he turned heel in 91 Dean also turned on the hottest babyface of the company a Jake did with Savage originally warrior but warrior got fired so they pushed home Jakes turn against Savage Dean also did several of Jakes heel mannerism during the turn the smile that turned to a murderous look and the lingering sitting blank stare after hitting the DDT Only thing missing for Dean now is to walk around wearing inferno snake tights and his entrance theme being a slowed down version with him saying Trust Me over it Last night Dean Ambrose became Dean The Snake Ambrose
John Douglas Racing Video	Paul Heyman s word about Roman Joe at the beginning of his promo were awesome I m glad he said what he said instead of ignoring it Roman wa part of that storyline and it needed to be mentioned instead of ignored and a usual Paul had every right word to say about him before moving on to the work section of it His transition from real to kayfabe in that situation wa seamless respectful and effective A
GTA 5 games GTA 5	thankyouroman I hope you survive lukima please superman punch and spear his butt
Jay Booth	Hope Roman get better soon no one deserves to go through that hope he whip leukemia as from post to post thankyouroman
Kassadyn	It make sense to me tbh Dean is like Roman s best buddy and when Roman left Dean snapped in anger and find it a good opportunity to jump on the one that broke them apart year ago or some shit idk more believable a well because he hesitated too
Yy Memi	If Brock fucking win fuck me dead
Alfie Ryan	I stopped watching raw after summer slam suppose I ll watch next week now All the best to one of the most divisive heel of our time
Bakorafanboy13	We believe in Roman
Dead Wafflez	I don t think it wa too soon to turn Dean heel It wa the perfect moment WWE used the sadness of Roman leaving to add to the turn Would it have the same impact with Roman there
Roman Reigns Fan	Roman reign got cancer so sad I m felling like crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
LockedLoadedDestruct	When roman beat cancer and come back the pop will be heard around the world Shame he got cancer again I wa finally beginning to warm up to roman after year of ignoring a majority his match and promos because they were meh Come back soon Big Dog ✊✊✊
Ron West	Two thing we know for fact Roman always kick out at 2 Roman always win Joe will beat cancer Oooooooooooowahhhhhhhhh
spaceracer23	the woman s division need an undercard title I suggest a TV Title This title would be defended on RAW Smackdown The hook with the title is that six win while holding the title allows the tv champ to declare themselves the no 1 contender for the woman s title of their choice The TV champ is also allowed to defend on BOTH show if they wish in order to get to six win faster This allows WWE to push a wrestler for a couple month without bringing Rhonda into it
J.R. Cummings	A WWE contract signing with no broken table or violence
NotClickBait	Rollins face at the end of the Roman segment wa so devastating Made me cry too
sona sona	wv nbv vv bwa DC c thx c n xvf BBC m ex dear dryer 76
nikmigvalbuena	giving dean a much heat a possible i guess
Miàn Ahmir	Roman shit
Crayniaq Gaming	Too soon Hell no it wasn t too soon I mean aside from the obvious fact that it s a work and I m sure Rollins and Ambrose went out for a couple of cold one s right after the show with Roman s announcement this wa PERFECT timing because literally especially after that announcement and then winning the title nobody expected the turn to happen in the same night That s what make it so perfect
Shavinder1999	Heel turn made complete sense Seth called dean a lunatic again and that made him snap Dean wa struggling with trying to fight off that name but couldn t in the end which is why when he wa attacking seth he kept yelling SAY IT AGAIN and WHATCH YOUR MOUTH YOU STILL THINK ITS FUNNY Justified turn
Moshe	The shield ha fallen
LIAR LIAR OF ME BLEW TOO MOVEMENT	I ll be cheering for leukemia
CurbCrusher	WWE really suprised me with that episode it wa good P s Get well soon Roman
Iron Marmite DC	The Roman reign situation is heart breaking and I understand why people are little apprehensive about the timing of dean turn Personally I feel like it had to be this week Nothing is going to get him more heat than turning on Seth when he did This is the way they are going to get absolute most out of it He clearly heard Seth say something which I hope he might reveal next week or maybe he just doesn t trust Seth without Roman there holding them together I just hope that wwe atleast talked to Roman about it
Advocatus Diaboli	Wow Roman Reigns face turn is when he reveals he is dying and leaving As usual too nobody s opinion mattered
whatssofunny171	So the point of the men MITB briefcase is
Jason Fuentes	Whole lotta unexpected thing happened here Two Face turn a contract signing where the table stayed intact and there wa no brawl a major Heel turn Fin Balor won a match and of course the unfortunate Roman Reigns hiatus
MAC CHZ	So nobody s gon na mention that Mayor of Knoxville reference by DX
HAVOK586	The heel turn wa executed perfectly They had been planting the seed for week so when a genuine setback occurred they were forced to pull the trigger Any other time or method of trying to turn him heel would have left u still loving him Now he seems like a genuine villain I think he s got Ciampa level of heat now which is great It s still early but I think we ll be talking about this RAW for decade to come and how this may be the best heel turn of all time
Marfoof	So are Mickie James and Alicia Fox now the Heels in Heels
Kenpachi343	I may not be a fan of Romans push but nobody deserves to have their livelihood taken away like that That wa not how I wanted him to lose the title I just hope this is not the end of his career
xXtherealbgbXx	It took Cancer to turn Roman full face Yes I realize how crappy that thought is Best of love to Him and the Anoai family
I hate the Young Bucks	It wa the perfect time for dean seth to break up Happening at the same time a roman leaving put over roman and I think the shield reunion hasn t worked and that they are stronger apart from each other
AcornPlays	I think the turn wa too soon in the fact I really don t think they had planned on doing it this week However if you were to have Dean turn any other week he wouldn t have been booed Seth wouldn t have been a emotional and it wouldn t have been quite a intense One of the most visceral heel turn of all time
Sourav DotA SEA stream	Cant even abuse him anymore the tv character we all hated most not the person roman really tough for him now
Andrew Downey	Love reign hope he get better a he is an under rated performer I thought the ending wa a touch of genius
yamochan	That wa one harsh raw to watch One thing to take home is hopefully Roman will be back soon because he finally did it He finally got everyone behind him Its so very sad that it took this to happen
rohit kumar	Give a superman punch to leukemia and come back man U definitely defeat it 100
Fritz XXI-TFK-777	Maybe balor is getting his push now a RAW is desperate for babyfaces with credibilitu
Naveen Burdak	M n aaj tak wwe kaval Roman reings k leya dheki h un ka eak bhi match bina dheka nahi chodda I m pray for God please Roman ko jaldi theak karo
Noah Jones	I honestly forgot almost everything not Shield related from this show
Mada Don	I request All the fan of Roman s to pray 4 him😐
turtlehead2	I ll have to rewatch the shield dog of war match to see if Dean and Drew touched each other
MisterMercy	This wa the first RAW I have ever been to live and holy shit What a bombshell to witness live
J Gordon	Its funny I actually think the timing wa PERFECT A week ago a heel turn would have got a cheer People have wanted Ambrose to be a heel forever Heel turn shouldn t get cheered They should get booed They knew that tonight of all night for the first time in age people wanted a cohesive shield Hell maybe even one last SHIELD bomb with Roman on Ziggler to close the night after the title win Instead they pulled the rug out People were booing the hell out of Ambrose The heel turn WORKED Now the story can proceed with the crowd against Dean and entirely on Rollins side a he s the one who in their eye is still holding the SHIELD banner with Roman It wa PERFECT
blackbeltbap	honestly I don t know about the ambrose turn either on one hand I really think they should have waited at least till next week to do it because it just add more emotion to the show on top of Roman and that the roman thing took a bit of believablity out of it ambrose clearly had gotten emotional before the backstage promo even after he had somehow made it through roman s segment where rollins broke down on the other hand ambrose now ha even more heat because he turned on rollins at the worst possible moment
Philly Prince	Prayers up for the big dog ThankYouRoman
1 billion subscribers with random videos	i never thought i would have cried for the wrestler i hated most Get well soon Roman
Michael Daniels	The way this setting up is Braun win and Drew get the push he deserves I hope this doesn t make Braun a transitional champion but Drew ha been on the top of his game since he ha been back and I would love Drew to become the first WWE Universal Champion from the Scotland and the UK in general
Tom Lucas	Hope joe beat this and get back into the ring Hate the character love the man
Syed Daniel	Damn man I wa shocked when I saw the news Really sad Hoping for a speedy recovery for him ThankYouRoman
MisterCorrin	Wet down elia hair and let him join the shield
Edwin Ortega	So fucking sad
Charlie Newman	imo Good vid on a Raw that had some real power As much a I hate opening talk replacing wrestling this one wa a gut punch powerful The main event and following action wa ace a well Between the open and the main event poor to so so with just a few really good bit imo
Lucas Chapa	Weird woke up this morning and Roman reign ha a cancer story line now Vince will try anything to get him over
cqdw 1234	Look think of it like this Dean could be the biggest heel after that turn If he keep being a low life heel then it ’ s kinda good but the timing of the turn is a bit off
Pappu Jatav	The Power OF ROMAN REIGNS
Fleabag McGilicuty	One of the greatest heel turn I ’ ve ever seen Some say too soon but it ’ s wrestling Using real life shitty situation to get heat is textbook
Cameron Worley	Here ’ s hoping Roman kick out before one and piledrives leukemia into oblivion
enniobg13	Im sad for the person and hope he can return healthy for his family For the character I think is the best for WWE WWE wa stuck and now they have all the possibility on the world
Unknown User	I wa thinking ambrose wa going to turn on reign imagine the heat
Ryan John Davies	Shock factor it wa amazing I didn t think they d turn him at all after Romans announcement and I would have hoped that WWE asked the Shield member if they were all okay with the turn happening tonight
Marc Leslie	One of the best heel turn we ’ ve seen in a long time I personally don ’ t think there wa a better time to do it It would have been le effective if they did it at any other time
Pellet #1	It ’ ll be cool if somehow Dean and Seth keep the belt for a good while and hate each other at the same time I could see Dean winning a match and making it a point not to ever tag in Seth
prince 007	thank you roman and get well soon
GunGreenGo	I think it a work Vince will do everything to get roman over
Prince spady	No matter how you felt about the booking of Roman or how he ’ s been presented no one want to see someone battle a sickness I hope he come back soon 😢 ThankYouRoman 🤙🏾
Deport Robbie Kruse	That Roman promo wa the best of his career WHEN he come back I hope he can channel that emotion into all promos thankyouroman
Adam Stewart	Everyone in the six woman tag match except maybe Sarah Logan deserves a better spotlight at Evolution But at least they won t get lost in the mix of a huge battle royal
MIKE CROWTHER	Can we trade Jack for Simon
David L	Thank you BIG DAWG
kaylamoonshoes	Dean wa yelling at Seth the whole time he wa beating him up Say it again and This is what you wanted I m curious to see where this go
AmadoMayday	Will Seth and Dean still have the belt or will they have to relinquish them
Wake me when we get there Huh	No matter how we feel about Roman a a wrestler he a a person I wish you well and hope you can beat this evil again
Amr Abdelhady	It just make me cry more and more every time 😭 and please Roman come back and I will be praying 🙏🏻 for you thankyouroman
The NDstructible1	Finally Elias is a face took long enough He ha the look and can tell a great story He ha what my biggest complaint with Roman and why I couldn t stand the Big Dog Character natural mic skill On that note Joe get your as back home to WWE I want you to work on your character and mic skill If you come back with that real feeling and improve there I will be behind your character cause Joe the real man is an awesome guy All the thing he doe outside the ring wa great Sorta what I like about Cena but Cena dislike wa cause he killed great story by never losing So with Joe out and the whole Tag Titles win and perfect heel turn cause it made it so much more It wa the most intense heat that felt so natural but off the chart The kid asking Dean why why Dean made it even more powerful Braun is the Babyface now and he can be part of himself As you can see via his social medium He is a goofy big guy and can be a face finally and his run will be more natural a a face cause it also feel natural compared to Roman God Damn it Joe you better kick Leukemias as so you can make the greatest comeback story ever I mean if he beat the big C imagine the hope this story would tell kid fighting cancer I could put up with the shitty Big Dog persona for that story Seriously while this wa a heart breaking episode of Raw it wa also an awesome one Also seeing that emotion on Seth Face made it hit home and brought tear to my eye cause in that moment the idea of this being a work stopped in it track
duracell 1692	That merch plug wa swift af
Ragestick	Lets hope that the Bigdog superman punch that leukemia and get well
Mridul Batra	Literally every wrestler on twitter ha said he s the locker room leader and the best guy around them I hope I can like the Roman Reigns character when he come back Get well soon Thanks for the entertainment
Skye Nyx	Oh god I had no idea Wow
Adam Celona	I wa their last night and had an awesome time
sammy 428	this will go down a one of the most emotional raw of all time thankyouroman
Kurt S	I boo Roman I cheer for Joe beat cancer
Clément Masse	Gon na find that asshole yelling you still suck after Roman told about his leukemia and we won t after he said he doesn t want people to feel bad for him and fuck his weak dumb as up
Shinneth	Your interpretation of Dean ’ s motivation to turn heel match mine Jack “ Lunatics ” usually won ’ t understand or care about doing a anything “ too soon ” And from a meta perspective given how badly they ’ ve handled teasing a Dean heel turn before this this wa the best time to do it to get the audience shocked AND invested Any other time after this loses one or both element
JuJuJetastic	Cancer the ultimate face turn
Buncy The Frog	I m a little confused logistically how you deal with the tag team belt being held by people actively feuding I m assuming
KryLys	ThankYouRoman
Kris Fields	ThankYouRoman so sad 😢😭
MrMikehunt87	The response from the fan is genuinely heart warming For all the hate that wa being thrown at him people realise that he is still a human being deep down inside I ve had a lot of negative thing to say about a TON of wrestling fan over the year but good on you all for showing the world that we aren t a hateful bunch of moron So where doe WWE go from here They were pushing Roman to be the next big thing the next cena the next Hogan the next Austin
james harmer	i think that wa the best heel turn ive seen in a long time i do think it perfect timing
KevinSkye1	Nothing strange about Sasha s position on the card she buried herself with that comment she made about the fan
SAY UNCLE!!!	They need to add MacIntyre to that match
Abyss 1	I really think the last segment should have been your first A grade People complaining about timeing but I think it wa perfect Everybody wa shocked cause nobody in that arena expected that and the way that Dean and Seth executed what wa perfect Roman will beat cancer cause he is Roman and this is what he always do lol and we will look at this moment a one of the best segment ever in profesional wrestling
Yo Uncle & Yo Daddy	I m incredibly sad now a Roman is probably my favorite full time wrestler at the moment
Erick R	Random thought there s some wrestler who are talented and need a push idea New nation of domination Lashley Apollo crew Titus These guy aren t getting enough credit
awesomeluis	I hope from the bottom of my heart that Joe Anoai kick leukemia butt and get well soon but if this is some sick kind of way to put Roman reign over and get the fan to cheer for him Wwe will get what s coming to them
Maximillianrex Carpediem	I think Finn won to cheer up the crowd
sanket sinha	The Ambrose heel turn whether good or bad depends on the why promo next week
JoyBoy_316	OMG I didn t watch the ep and I just heard it in this vid this is the worst news I ve heard in a long time get well soon joe and come back to u ThankYouRoman
necrolobstercon gaming	I know it an angle but what the hell did rollins say that pissed off dean that made him scream to rollins to say it again I reiterate i know it an angle Did anybody find dean s turn peculiar he seemed almost hurt Not owning his turn but rather hurt emotionally
Theoretic101	Hate Roman love Joe Anoai
SuaveTitan	Whats tricky about the turn Its OBVIOUS he wa turning so why not do it now while anybody wa on a emotional high gon na go down a one the best turn ever
Sharaun Martinez	Wouldn ’ t wish that on anyone but we finna got rid of roman If only for a little while
Erik Finkbeiner	if Alexa Bliss is injured they should make it a triple threat match between Trish Stratus Lita and Mickie James in my opinion it s a nice nostalgia match at least and certainly better than a tag team match with Alicia Fox
NinjaSYXX	Wishing all the best for Roman ThankYouRoman On another note it may not be smart business wise but having house show a week or 2 prior to payperviews seems to be not so good of an idea Alexa getting injured is a huge blow to that match
Adolfo Coy	Maybe Roman wa the lynch pin for Dean and Romans sickness drove Ambrose mad
Potty Top	One would of thought by now after watching raw so much Jack would realise how much the WWE love their 50 50 booking Obviously he isn t that clicked on how WWE do thing
Robb Hebert	Having Dean turn heel on this night wa a very rare stroke of genius for WWE Kudos to them for getting that right Biggest heel turn moment since Ciampa turned on Gargano
Val	I honestly believe Dean s turn wa absolutely perfect They managed to make a predictable heel turn unpredictable and the timing wa perfect for Dean to get some major heat
KingsHeathDon91	I would give the Reigns segment a C
Brad Montague	To try and spin a small positive out of this Roman at least got to see the fan don t hate Joe they hate the character he portrays Once that character wa pulled back the fan supported him without question For a guy that s been mercilessly booed and ha had trouble handling that reaction at time I hope this help in the grand scheme of thing Good luck Roman Come back stronger than ever
tomtomthebear	All it took to genuinely make Roman face wa leukaemia if only vince knew this sooner
brock _heymanguy	Are the raw tag title going to get relinquished too 🤔 If so put them on AOP
Nick Montenegro	Get Well and beat it Roman a k a Joe I love your family and yourself Roman will be back
Drake Farmer	I hate Roman but not Joe Hope he will get better
George Varughese	Yes it wa too soon I give it a F They only have each other and wtf is going to happen to the tag title
Sam Laskowski	thankyouroman thatheelturn
Phil Christian	The heel turn had to happen With Roman gone they need to get people into the Main Event scene If Braun win and Brock leaf the main event scene go to Braun Drew Seth and Dean so they need the Seth Dean feud completed by the time Braun Drew have completed their feud so the champion ha someone to face especially since Braun and Drew haven ’ t held the top belt and aren ’ t experienced main eventers
MVPboppin	That wa the perfect time to go heel The show must go on and it just made the biggest heel on the roster It wa definitely not too soon It ’ s story telling It ’ s pro wrestling
A.W. Lawson	I hated the heal turn HATED IT However I feel like it ’ s time we start allowing wrestler to have an in ring character apart from their real life persona When Roman said my real name is Joe it could usher in a new age of non existent kayfab It would really help the product It is absolute garbage right now with this meandering between real and fake
Logan Johnson	That wa a sad start but an intriguing ending
Huricane Lizard	Roses are red Violets are blue Leukemia hit it ’ s finisher Roman still kick out at two For all the crap we talk about Roman and I still don ’ t like his push that wa such a heartfelt speech and it really shook me I wish him a speedy recovery
wyrw	So will Seth and Dean have to defend the tag title
Pelvis Wrestley	ThankYouRoman
Scott Reardon	I ’ m a little surprised that Glen Jacobs is ok with participating in Crown Jewel I imagine that his doing business with Saudi Arabia wouldn ’ t look too good from a political standpoint
Sean	Aside from the Roman situation something really sad from WWE is the complete disregard they ve shown for Evolution They want brownie point for The first ever all woman s PPV but it really seems like they aren t even bothering to make any attempt to make it a GOOD PPV The card is smaller than any of their other PPVs and mostly very meh They clearly didn t really care about this show beyond the publicity It s very upsetting to see them constantly treat the woman s division this way And knowing WWE I wouldn t be surprised if this show get very low rating on the network due to the lackluster card and rather than blame themselves for putting on a bad show Vince and the rest of the higher ups will think it s because no one want to watch woman s wrestling
Benjamin Kelln	That Ambrose heel turn wa executed perfectly but I think it wa the wrong time
Cody Laighton	Ambrose Turing now is perfect Any other time he would be cheered when he turned On this show he wa basically the devil
Clash with Andrew	Roman will be the biggest baby face on the roster when he come back And I predict within 2 week or so after his return they try and turn him heel However he will be cheered when they want boo just like he wa booed when they wanted cheer I respect the guy and am proud to be a fan I did boo him but it wa only because of booking I will be on Romans side from this point forward Sorry for the short essay praying for you Joe
MrsPig69	Roman always kick out at 2 anyway so he ll be fine
J-TAR	When and if Roman beat leukemia maybe they should consider bringing him back under his real name and without the Big Dog moniker
Charles Berg	The good news is there are many different type of Leukemia and we do not know which type he ha here s to hoping it is not a severe strain of the disease Personally I do not like Roman Reigns however I have nothing but respect for Joe thank you for your hard work and your dedication to the business
Ryan Smith	I absolutely love Elias I am so glad they tuned him face Really just hoping they don ’ t ruin his Booking because he can be a superstar
Quan D	The pop when Roman come back is gon na be CRAZY
Zyshawn Moore	Good Luck to Big Rome in his fight with leukemia Hopefully he s back very soon I haven t shed a tear in year but I did tonight
Malorm	I m an unapologetic Roman detractor That said my prayer are with Joe for a full recovery and strength for his family Never thought I d say this but I can t wait to see Roman back a soon a possible I ll never be able to boo him again
Naheem Quattlebaum	ThankYouRoman
JSAcousticJuice	Watch it back and take a shot every time Maggle mention Roman Great episode ruined by Cole a always I wish no harm to Roman but by Christ i didn t need to know he ha leukaemia 600 time
JustOmegaMan Ω	Personally I m ok with Dean turning It get a bunch of heat on him a a heel It s something fresh It s pro wrestling based on story not real life They re allowed to be friend whilst feuding Finally Dean didn t turn on Roman just Seth
kibowman	Sunday sunday sunday
Mcp2powers	“ I ’ m gon na take out Braun ” by kicking him once Yep that ’ ll do it No more monster
Nathan Eli Draper	I ’ m thinking about Finn Balor ’ s win against Bobby Lashley is that with Dean turning heel and Roman the top booked babyface gone Finn is essentially the next guy up This may be Finn ’ s time to shine 😳
Hermaeus Jackson	Just go to show people may have bitched and complained about Roman but in general people are better than that and are able to see the human being behind the character I m very glad people didn t boo him because that would have been tragic
Snake	Well I wanted Roman to take a break but not like this
CR 15	Wwe never mention that crown jewel is being held in saudi arabia on tv neither on raw nor on sd
Connor Richardson	Get well soon Roman
Evaldas Sadauskas	this week s raw wa really high on emotion ThankYouRoman spear the leakaemia and pin it and we are waiting for your return DA BIG DOGGG
ysonline	So Braun went face Elias went face and Dean went heel all in one night
Mitch Davison	I ll tell you what you grade it Jack Fucking A This wa bloody insidious and the perfect time to turn Dean for maximum impact You can t tell me that the shield lad wouldn t have loved this out of kayfabe Top 5 best heel turn
twinewinder1	Deans motivation will be something Seth said to him in the ring after the match which set him off
King Covfefe	That shit made me cry hard make you realise how precious everything is Love to everyone in the comment and big love and prayer to Joe WWE probably didn ’ t need to mention it another 50 time though nearly turned off so many time Really hard episode to get through
MattFrencHammer	As a 15 year old i can t quite realize yet what happened i wa one of them the guy who booed him every week for his terrible booking when he came out last night i nearly turned off raw i feel so bad and i think i have learned something today i think lot of kid discovered that wrestling wa fake today
Sean Huggan	Roman is a man of faith a am I Im praying for him his family his fan I pray that not only will this episode of cancer go away but there will be a huge miracle in the cancer leaving for good I can do all thing through Christ who strengthens me Love ya Big Dog
gazbason	AOP for tag title
Triggered Wresting	ThankYouRoman
Jennifer Agar	No it not too soon All this fake outrage is silly it wa the perfect time To get him heat

H3AD	You forgot the part whr dean did the cross sign when he wa in the crowd
Shady	Really fucked up of WWE to play with my emotion Get Well Roman
Ty Marshall	ThankYouRoman
gingergreek	I give the opening segment an F for FUCK CANCER Regardless of what you think of Reigns wrestler are literally the most selfless entertainer because whilst doing something they love they do it knowing that they are in the longterm sacrificing their body and wellbeing just for the sake of putting a smile on our face
Rice MenaRQ	Seth cry got me
sriram panth	I have mixed feeling With Roman gone I see a better and more unpredictable product coming out from raw Genuine world class talent like Drew and Seth will be vying for the top title Maybe the wwe championship will start headlining once in a while a well But I will miss booing Roman He is a tough lad who ha made his career fighting against adversity You need serious mental strength to come out after beating Taker and soak in that reaction So I am sure the big dog will be back soon Just hope he show up on NXT and put a younger talent over on his return which would earn him major respect from all the smarks ThankYouBigDog HUUUUUAAAAA
SR B	I don t understand the issue with the Dean heel turn I think it wa perfect Doing now give it the most possible heat without actually using Romans sickness a cheap heat No one wa expecting it now which it made it even better For me it wa well timed perfectly executed especially by Seth and I m so excited for this feud
Dyscalcular.	Don t worry we all know Roman s gon na kick out at 2
Daniel Wilson	deen how cud u
zhivago	It s about time something ended his push lol
James Harrison	It s a work you filthy mark Vince ha proved he will go to any length to get Reigns over
Ady Simons	Its ACTUALLY took cancer to finally get Roman over
Martin Walker	is it too soon Don t be silly it s a show and the surprise wa great make no difference to Roman so why not make it a great show
Rueck	YEAH JACK GIVE TAMINA THAT WOMENSMATCH THE D
1 Survivor	Cancer is a bitch I lost my uncle to a very aggressive form of Leukemia 20 year ago I m not sure which specific kind but he went from healthy to sick to death within a matter of only about 1 2 week I wa young at the time and it hurt me a lot So I know how bad it can be When I heard about Roman I cried And I have no shame saying that When I saw Seth cry after hugging Roman I had a nasty pit in my stomach it made me worry about how bad his diagnosis may be I m praying hard for Joe and his family Love the character of Roman Reigns or not Joe seems like a genuinely good guy And he s always busted his as for the fan Please pray for this man guy Trust me nobody deserves to go through what he s going through I really really hope that one day he come back and get to do what he love to do Go kick cancer as Big Dog We re here for you 💯
Vincent Monroe	Apart from that stunning news at the begining and I wish Joey all the best please get through that time 3 ThanYouRoman what wa really heartbreaking story wise wa the Its okay from Seth after the first Dirty Deeds Also the look on his face at the end
Savage Sagwa.	Come on big dog Spear cancer right out it boot thankyouroman
Omega Riddler	It s obvious you didn t hear what Dean Ambrose wa saying during the assault but it s obvious what the justification wa He feel like he s being treated a a joke and he s had enough with Seth Rollins making lunatic joke
kmt78901	Since when is a roll up a clean win lmao
Ishtarahara	new punishment for a ppv walk a mile in Alicia Fox s shoe
Jorma Steelhail	I think this wa the perfect time to turn Ambrose heel I think his reasoning is Seth calling him lunatic and being condescending to him about him I think that will be very interesting to play out
Adrian Smith	Liked this Video For Roman Regins
DannyBTalks	SpearCancer FightBigDog
Just One Guy	I hope I am wrong but I swear to God if this is all a work and Roman return at Royal Rumble entering at 30 and win It s a disgusting disgraceful thought I know but someone need to say it I don t expect WWE creative to stoop so low to get one guy over but still I have never before hoped to be so wrong a I am right now I hope Joe recovers and return to the ring soon
Helicard	You will never see Lashley Apollo and Big E in the ring at the same time For the same reason you don t see Mick Foley Mankind and Dude Love in the ring the same time
kuhpunkt	The new Halloween movie is no remake it s a sequel to the original Get your fact straight
TheTwuh	I really think the turn should have waited honestly I wanted the turn but it really should have wait in my opinion I mean the emotional backing to it made for incredible timing but fucking hell lol Honestly the reason I have an issue with the timing isn t because Roman had to take time off I just think it being immediately after winning the tittle wa poor timing for the belt themselves because they re likely gon na be put on the back burner so we can focus on the new dynamic between the two
zdruva Nosworthy	I hope roman get well but and if he doe beat the leukemia vince will be rubbing is hand cause everyone will be behind him and if people didnt cheer roman during is wwe career so far it not hate towards the guy but how he wa booked thats what people hated about it cause it wasnt a genuine thing
soullessginger83	Ok i wonder if i am the only one who noticed on the still picture for the sasha v ruby that both liv and Sarah s face look like they were photoshopped in from another career which is also filmed lol Don t worry Liv I still love ya
Connor Darbyshire	FuckYouCancer Roman ha been an idol to me since returning back to watching WWE and this hit hard Nothing ha made me cry in WWE but this wa a bullet to the heart He will fight he will conquer and he will return faster stronger and better than ever Thank you Roman❤️👊🏻

space pegasus	I think the timeing if the Dean turn wa great a we were all excpting a hell turn from dean but doing it now pull the rug out under u

Daryl Castillo	Kobashi that shit Leati

Georges Drouillard	Keep your shoulder off the mat and we ll be sure your hand reach the rope Roman You got this
Brandon Denniston	Not a bad show
HockeyDood 33	Just honestly I think it made the heel turn even better because there not using Roman a the focal point of the feud but it make Seth Rollins the Biggest Baby Face in all of wrestling probably my favorite heel turn off all time

Anthony Lopez	Come on now Nobody I mean NOBODY think it s a work to play off his diagnosis from over a decade ago It s not a if the WWE hasn t done worse to generate heat
Venemofthe888	The title on raw need to dispersed a little more since seth and Dean hold the men s title and the universal title being vacant now I hope braun win the universal title to be a mega face The tag title I hope go to someone else cause atm they r just kinda there
Jamieb1994	I really hope Joe Roman get better soon come back to RAW better stronger Also even though the past few RAW show hasn t been too enjoyable imo but last night s RAW ha been enjoyable Elias apparent face wa entertaining to see wasn t expecting Dean to turn heel especially when they ve been crowned a new champion but having it happen last night ha gave me mixed feeling though In a way it wa interesting but at the same time I felt like it might of been a bad timing for it to happen
Sequellbellhelmel	That wa one of the most emotional heel turn in quite a while Everybody saw it coming except not today It gave it that extra oomph that additional punch to the gut if you will
Kenny Havoc	Roman is over now He ll come back to a monster reception and he ll be loved And we ll all love him too
