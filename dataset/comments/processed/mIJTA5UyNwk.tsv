Jordan Eggers	He's gonna kick out at 2 as per usual
Ric Ancira	...I like big, sweaty women.
Andrew Howden	3:05 ha hahahahaha haasahabab
DJ Grice	Its always a good day when there's a Father Ted reference.
jph727	Fantastic intro üòÇ
juggalotopuss	One of the best if not the best time to turn heel ever. This was great. Such emotion was invoked. Perfection ( sorry Mr. Hennig).
Dave Booshty	8:57 i have no idea either way , but to me , it almost looked like that lady was "planted" by the WWE.
Jordan Darnell	Dude wwe is fake he don't really have it Fuck u an him wwe is fake
Shun Shahin	I love you boss plz caming back üò≠üò≠
Sagger Mail	What is this? B tech WhatCulture.............
Robert Billing	At least Reigns can be a true babyface when he comes back now.
AkiraSlayer	8:54 is that a Impractical Jokers reference? If so it makes me love you even more Ross haha.
Leather Hitman	#26 I feel like this could've been better timed at Crown Jewel. You know, *AFTER* Drew and Dolph used their rematch clause and win the tag titles back. Dean snaps, attacks Seth and set-up for a Wrestlemania rivalry. Dean wins the intercontinental championship with Seth going to Smackdown. Gives them room as singles competitors while RR gets some R&R.
JaredTheCat88	Fucking loved that Father Ted reference there.
Quinn and Valor	I think an important line can be drawn between what people hate about Roman and what's going on. People hate the booking and creative direction of WWE character Roman Reigns. I am one of those people. Most of us, and certainly myself, hold no ill will against Joe and never have. By all accounts he's a lovely guy backstage and it's not remotely his fault that he's just not booked in an interesting way, and what's happened to him is absolutely dreadful, we're all looking forward to seeing his return.
kryceksangel	I haven't watched this series since it was on the first channel
Stitch	Maybe Michael Cole IS a women ü§î
Art Vasch	"Don't do milk" could be a new shirt, lmao
J-ROC	Bishop 'Len' Brennan intro was brilliant! LOL
Mike Tyla	Bobby Lashleys mouthpeice should henceforth be known as Leo Thrush. Cos he's an irritating cu..................
seanomac13	HAHA I loved that Father Ted reference at the beginning!ü§£ü§£ü§£
Dodge Charger	Robot angle
DeeDo	I‚Äôve been a bit off and on on watching wrestling, so I was just wondering, what do people think of Renee Young (hopefully I spelled that right) as a commentator? Personally I think she‚Äôs a great addition to the table.
Mystikman	Is this is a Storyline from WWE just to get Romen Over I‚Äôm don whet WWE forever. Because you just do not kidding Whit Cancer.
Mario Gillette	Guitar straps can be expensive!
maskath	Wasn‚Äôt it Shawn Michaels who said nostalgia was a polite way of saying old not triple h?
Marcarse The Barbarian	Dean's heel turn was fucken dumb, he legit turned on seth for no reason othet than "im a crazy guy". And now we have half the titles. on RAW vacant, coz i can only assume the tag titles have to go vacant now as what team can beleivably fued with Dolph and Drew?
Brad Heckman	You guys should do the 10 best Roman Reigns moments for a video
Jeremy Boyle	I‚Äôve always been a fan of the big dog Prayers your way Joe I‚Äôm in your corner
Jake Green	DONT CALL ME LEN YOU LITTLE PRICK!
langzi74	Am I the only one seeing a whole sale change with the Shield? Unfortunately Seth Rollins will be kick out of the group and Ambrose will take those tag team title belts back to....Dolph Zigler and Drew McIntyre and the New Shild will be born!
Anirban Kundu	I'm not a fan of the roman reigns character. Never liked his push one bit. But after raw last night, i sure as fucking hell respect the shit out of joe anoa'i, the man playing the character. Hope he gets well soon from leukemia and makes a comeback. Hate roman reigns all you want, but please don't shower your hate on joe anoa'i the man. Know the difference between the two.
Brenda Morris	My gosh, I've never seen anyone talk as fast as you other than an auctioneer. Is your brain really running that fast?
tony matrisin	üê£üéä
Bakura	Attitude era SUCKS. Ruthless era is AWESOME. I agree!
Salamence778	"Dont do milk kids" f*ck I'm dead
DedMan28	6:58 - You HAD to go that route, Ross... XD
Boots!	5:41 I haven't done milk for about 15 years
Liam Evans	Roman Reigns VS. Leukaemia - Super Man Punch, Spear. 1. 2. 3! Roman Reigns kicks Leukaemia's ass! That's how it's going down. The Big Dog's got this! No doubt.
Raymond Lewis	Road to the WWE Evolution was boring.
combatinfantry008	Dean turning heel on Seth right after winning the tag titles made absolutely no sense. How was this not a WTF?
sujan m Kashyap	Don't do milk kids- ross
Zac Heap	Such a weird feeling, partley because of how unexpected and sad this all is. But also because where does raw go now? Noone feels big time enough (wwe's terrible booking=only 1 protected top guy) at least if he does beat it he will be the top face wwe think he is.             I just fear that if people get over while Romans away and he does hopefully recover , wwe will push him to the moon at others expense killing whatever star power they've gained and over time sympathy and support for roman (which will be there if they book him properly) not much faith though (seths heel return, Daniel Bryan.....)                 2 ps,1 my pops died of leukaemia don't at me 2 just have him be a g with the usos as a group,  anoi mafia or something  would be cool. Longest comment ever
supersasukemaniac	Evolution is the first ever ALL WOMENS PPV* *With Appearances by Ric Flair, called by MIcheal Cole. What the Fook?!
King Linksy	Tbh didn‚Äôt think you would do a wtf out of respect
logan kerr	one of the most saddest Nights on Raw in years. its right up there when Edge retired. really hope that THE BIG DOG superman punches cancer again!
Antercept	Thank you other Samoa Joe
Kyle Cavanagh	Like for the Father Ted tribute.
Refer Panthers	Wait reigns is 33
ThatWhiteguy	The fact that Vince has tried literally everything to get Roman over, and is a mad bastard enough to actually do it, I'm not entirely convinced this isn't a long con to get Roman Reigns cheered. Claim cancer, take him off TV for a year and a half, and he's finally the babyface of the company you've wanted for the last 3 years.
316whatupz	Well, to be fair, Michael Cole wrestles like a girl.....just saying.
Rocky Pingale	When Roman came out with civilian clothes, I knew there's something bad coming up.  Speedy Recovery Roman
thisdamnthingy	Renee and Beth could've called the whole ppv, but oh no, Cole needs to get his fingers in everything. Not remotely surprised.
Robert Kent	With years of trying to get Roman over using every trick WWE knew, the biggest positive reaction Roman gets is when he announces he has Leukemia. They were finally cheering for him.   I do think he is good in the ring and I hope he beats this and is able to come back better.
George Holloman	Drew McIntyre is a beast promo. Also. Roman. Nooooooo :,(
liam flanagan	First time watchin in a long time loved the father ted refernce us irish love it
Kimball Infidel	Is it just me or has Ross started looking more handsome lately
Flukex1001	More Father Ted intros please! Hahahahaha
Doug	Best intro yet, Bishop Ross.
Muhammad Smith	Zayn is injured  Owens is injured Bliss is injured Lashley is apparently working hurt Roman's out Universal Championship is vacant Lowest TV ratings  Lowest attendance ratings RAW IS CURSED
trojansfan87	to be fair, ross, evelution CAN'T be an all girl show as there aren't enough girl commentators (hence why cole is on the show) or refs, not to mention the writers, agents, and production personnel
Dark Hawk	Said this on Jack's vid, but... it bears repeating: F**k Cancer.  But, on a lighter note... Yeah, you'd think on the go-home show for Evolution the women's matches might be given a bit more time. I guess Sasha and Ruby got a bit of time, but the fatal 4-way was ... what... two minutes?  And... goddamn... the timing on that heel turn just twisted the knife. Definitely heard several audience members "Tonight? Really?"... goddamn.  Also bears repeating: Looking forward to seeing you back after you beat this, Joe.
logan breau	Hate his character with Vince's never ending push, but the man behind that doesn't deserve cancer.
Lenore Estefany	Get well Joe Anoa'i. Hope you can come back to the ring someday.   Also going to miss Ross screaming THE BIG DOG too.
jaeger mclaughlin	4:40 stay with the WWE roster leave indy wrestlers to the jobbers
Gabriel Cook	Same-move-simon Reigns has *3* Moves of Doom. Those *3* Moves of Doom were enough to defeat Brock Lesnar for the universal championship at SummerSlam... Leukemia doesn't stand a chance.
Ross TwedDiddler	Hello, I am evil Ross. Also known as, Ross Tweddiddler. *insert run of the mill heel line such as I didn‚Äôt do it for the fans*
MisAce2500	*Get well DA BIG DAWG we're praying for you*
Heartshapedbox81	For anyone who cares to listen to my random story  For this episode of Raw my mind completely blanked, I was tired and so my brain wasn't functioning as well as it should be, the only thing that I managed to keep in my head was party planning because I was in charge of taking care of party planning for my little brother's birthday, so I'm just so concerned about making sure he has a nice day and everything's great and fun for him and the rest of my siblings who are celebrating it with him so I completely spaced on Raw... Absolutely forgot about it. I haven't missed an episode of Raw in years, I couldn't say for how many years but once you have my loyalty it's hard to get rid of it and WWE has had it in spite of a lot of crap so once the fun was all over and everybody's about to fall over i then I start to feel like I'm forgetting something, I pull up my phone and see a thumbnail of Shawn Michaels and Roman Reigns... the headline didn't even register for me very well I was just like well this is strange, my brother (not the little one) comes and tells me that Dean turned on Seth at the end of Raw and I'm just like what the heck are you talking about?! Isn't it Sunday? so I'm slowly registering how skewed my head is and realize what he just told me, I am so ticked, first of all that he spoiled the ending for me secondly that they decided to turn Ambrose and thirdly that I missed raw for the first time in ages, as an apology for spoiling it for me I'm guessing he pulls Raw up for me to watch but this is like 1:30 or 2 a.m. and I actually sat there and watched the whole thing, bawling at the start while Roman was talking and feeling kind of weird and Melancholy afterwards, but I think they did a sufficient job of still trying to entertain and take one's mind off of things because I wasn't just sitting there gloomily watching it I was entertained by the matches and everything... Well not everything considering those heavily scripted talking segments backstage, I'm hopeful for Elias's Fac turn to go well, kind of wish they turned Bobby Roode heel if they aren't going to do anything other than repeat what he's doing with Chad Gable every week and then the end match rolled around and I couldn't shake the weird stomach knot inside since due to my brother I already knew what the outcome would be I just didn't know when or why and when he turned on him I don't know if it was just because of finding out about Roman earlier or because I really didn't want him to turn because despite already knowing I was put into a shocked silence and near to tears... So very well done WWE everyone who I would normally talk to was asleep so I'm just sitting there by myself not processing anything properly because it's 5 a.m. so yes I have issues but that's not really surprising is it? considering I'm a WWE crazy-fan.

AK Minds	"RENEE YOUNG!.... Has a nice.... THE RENEE YOUNG COMMANTARY! THE RENEE YOUNG COMMENTARY!" - That's how Smackdown Just Bring It commentary worked.
Erotzi	Classic Father Ross Opening
H24 Delirium	Don't do milk?  I agree i drink 10 pints a day it's a huge problem  I'm a milkaholic and I need therapy the only cure is WTF moments by Ross
whisperienced	I hope he makes a full recovery, comes back with a new theme (The Shield theme is getting old) and maybe some attire that isn't black.  Maybe change the appearance altogether and hopefully he can start being treated the same as other top stars of the past.  Will he ever be a Stone Cold or Rock?  No but he is too talented and from a great family of wrestlers to be booed because of Vince's terrible booking of him.
Michael Eddy	0:15 Father Ted reference
Psycho_retros_2 Streams	8:53 I don‚Äôt know if it was meant to be this way... but Impractical Jokers reference
Tim Harris	Come on Joe. The Big Dog beat this once. He can do it again. Sending prayers up for Joe and his family.
G Robinson	It's a work!!!
The Negan Guy	I feel bad for Ross getting kicked in the arse üòÅ
Bulk Logan	threatened murder?¬† in Saudi Arabia?¬† fucken hell, lads!
Logan Jeffery andrew	Damn I think the dean turn was perfect
NWCtim	I think the audio cuts in the UK broadcast weren't to hide crowd profanity against Dean, it was to hide crowd support for Dean.
awelcruiz	Loved that Father Ted reference.
AwesomeFluff 13	So are we not talking about chyna in the intro of road to evolution?
Charlie Newman	imo Cool intro for a good vid on a Raw that was one hell of a roller coaster ride. imo
dursty stuffs	I hated Roman Reigns as a character like most people but I agree after I saw last night I almost cried because I lost one of my best friend's to leukemia and family members. its nothing to make fun of.
richcall1001	I can‚Äôt stand the Roman Reigns character but I feel sorry for Joe. No one deserves that. I hope he beats this and comes back.
Sarah lee	That joke is from father Ted
Secret	Hell nah! Hold up!
Rawrjay	some fans are so stupid. theyve done nothing but hate on roman constantly, and now that they cant theyre all silent as fuck. i never hated on roman, but its just ridiculous how a serious disease needs to infect someone before some people stop hating on a performer.
Some frickface	I woke up to the news. It's my birthday
Cody McCollum	Lol great father ted reference
MickOnYourFace12	I can't tell if he called Brock a 'money slut' or a 'money slug'. Either way, fucking funny.
The Hitcher	No Way Renee! No Way Renee! No Way Renee!
Ambrose O'Neill	Lovely Father Ted reference
StriX46	Hated Roman...wanted him gone...not like this..its absolutely heart breaking and saddening...all my prayers go to him and his family
Joe Lord	Thought you couldn‚Äôt top intros with the Shooting Stars Baked Potato, then you pull out a father ted reference
Raging Kiwi TV	Ah-no-E is how you say it.
Astrithor	YES! When I mentioned Bishop Brennan after the punishment, I was sooo hoping you would do an opening like this! Thank you, Ross!
dakota krueger	Im going to be the one to say it. I wish him the best and to beat it again but career wise, he needed a break and hopefully if he comes back he will be refreshed and ready to start again
Haydn Rodrigues	I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about Roman!! And please don‚Äôt hate me if I say this but why do I feel that this is a way to get roman over? If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm very sorry but it could seem like a Vince McMahon thing to do!!
Ams S	That father ted opening was legendary! But seriously get well Roman hope you pull through he is a tough guy he will
Louie G	Best luck to Roman and Tazz was the shit fuck off big tits tweddel
ob1foru	Maggle!
Lopezg2	Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the first wtf moments in early 2016?
Tyler Woodward	All the people in the World Cup are former world champions. How did I not see that sooner?
Becky Fal	Needed this today. Thank you Ross ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mike Kramer	Anyone else notice that Ronda is somehow 24-0 in WWE? Lol
BrianBunka	Maybe Renee meant in person? haha
mjstory1976	Ross won't be able to say THE BIG DOG for awhile
Aaron Elliott	father ted
SamishWad	Opening with a Father Ted Reference of Bishop Brennan realising yes....Ted did kick him up the arse.....not the way I expected this particular video to open üòÇ
Jonathan Leonard	Quality Father Ted reference.
Tommy Bitchface	I never, ever thought I'd look forward to a Roman Reigns return so much.
Jon Chambers	Bishop Brennan intro for the win!
Adam Southward	Spot on about Kurt... his voice acting in WWE 2K19 is the drizzling shits too...
2rrkd	I really hope Roman/Joe gets better, for the sake of his family. Though I have to applaud WWE for still going through with Ambrose's heel turn, on the night Roman leaves to battle Leukemia and he and Rollins win the tag team titles, Ambrose still DDT'd Rollins' head on the floor. It kind of made Ambrose a bigger asshole than when Rollins betrayed them years ago.
monkeynuts	Ah bishop brennan
Matt F	I thought Renee and Beth Phoenix were calling evolution, didn‚Äôt they say that last night? I took that to mean Renee was in the Cole position
Dana Chappell	Not a Roman fan, but I hope he kicks it‚Äôs ass. Cancer sucks. Good luck to him. He can beat this
coned	for me, the problem was never actually roman. the problem was the booking/creative. he's perfectly fine in ring and on mic. he's also got that "someone dreamed up the perfect wrestler" look. dude just LOOKS like "the top guy". i was never really a fan, but i MARKED THE FUCK OUT when he finally beat brock. we finally had the belt on raw every week. it finally existed again. raw finally had a purpose. when he comes back (and i'm sure he will) he's going to get a stone cold 1998 level pop and it's gonna be insane.
The Dragon Legault	Deans heel turn was perfectly executed it pretty much guaranteed that he was going to get food and heat Becky Lynch's turned was good but nobody's going to boo her what they did here they made it impossible to cheer Dean that turn was done perfectly
Matthew Salzer	I saw asuka in that picture
thierryman	I watched the Roman promo.  It's interesting to see how the crowd changes as soon as he reveals his illness.  They went from booing Roman Reigns the wrestler to cheering Joe the person which was a great thing.
JoJo is not an anime	Only leukemia can stop him lmao
WolfkinNorthclaw	The crowd last night was fantastic.
Gold8neye	5:28 Omg that Kurt Angle Promo Don't do milk kids (¬∞I am dead).
Anthony Davidek	And just like that, Roman was Over with The Marks.
sriram panth	Getting those South Park and impractical Jokers references make me feel so smarky!
The 1flym	Dad-generation X
Taylor Whitman	Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs gonna be so nice to hear his music hit and the crowd explode in full on cheers. He doesn‚Äôt deserve the boos, especially with this reveal. Have a whole new level of respect for Roman Reigns.
Dan Goodfellow	Man this feels like getting ready to watch a retro wtf to the Owen Heart Tribute episode.
kilala plush	Get Well Soon Joe ‚òπüò¢
IREslayer	Fr Ted Reference  üëåüëå
Andrew Harrington	I never knew that Shawn Michaels is a gay fish. Thanks for the knowledge.
dafdev	I thought I heard Jax saying women can do anything... Apart from perform in Saudi Arabia lass eh!
drunkendan	What's with Asuka not being on the image? Simple, Vince buried her. Kairi is only on there cause she is the current champ which watch her lose because Vince has final say on the match outcome and he is a racist old fuck.
Mr tickle	Hold on another real WTF moment  is that Simon Miller is the spokesperson for WWE 2K 19 on Sky
Jamie Hogan	Oh god no please keep Michael Cole. Imagine a 3 woman booth of Renee, Beth and Stephanie
Coby Taylor	To that one guy shouting what during romans speech, you my friend, are a tosser üëçüèª
3s10	Well, they literally NEVER win...
EDH	Don‚Äôt do milk, kids.
F*8K cancer it took my mom and I want her back	It's bull shit a horrible disease that just leaves families to pick up the pieces.. people out there wasting their potential on the streets or with  trivial things and this man with  children ,a wife finally a achieves his dream and goals just to get terminal illness again..... It's all bullshit and it triggers and pisses me off thinking about it ..... I hope I see him back soon
Steve Engblom	Love the father Ted references, one of my favorite shows from the 90s, and I'm an American!
Sean Motes	FUCK CANCER
Mridul Batra	Week 6 of protest Give Renee Young her intro for her WTF moments. Even Byron has one
Maine Cyclist	You missed the guy in the crowd as Dean was leaving who said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not nice.‚Äù  Come back better than ever, Joe.
xxjoeyladxx	I only saw ‚ÄúRoman Reigns Re‚Ä¶‚Äù so I thought he was retiring. Regardless, this is very sad üò¢
Ryan Reed	In a poor attempt to lighten the mood:  I also like big, sweaty women.
Jake Pearl	These superstars are human just like you and me....well maybe not so much you Ross...but me for sure...you wankedy wank.
Ben Scott	ITS A WORK
Jimboola	Father Ted reference! üëç
Jason Horton	Father ross
nmcvideos	Father Ted intro. Love it
gamewiz720	Did anyone else see the "Alexa, be my stepmom" sign during the Women's Fatal Four-way Match last night?
91fawcett	Kick Bishop Brennan up the arse
SeanTheMan1	I‚Äôm pretty sure that intro was a reference to Father Ted
Robert Rodriguez	Love that Father Ted opening
no this is jodi	when dean was beating down seth, seth just took it. he layed down and said "it's okay"....it fucking hurt.
jinratgeist	Don't do milk, kids! - ROSS (2018)
Akshay Babhale	I think this is only a storyline that Roman will return at 2019 Royal Rumble and winning it and once again main eventing Wrestlemania 35 straight 5th year. This is the only way WWE can get sympathy for Roman.
Avatar1977	I'd like to thank you for going with my suggested intro from the booting video aftermath.  Although chances are you already thought of it, I still claim credit :D
Liam Geary	Surely it should have been JBL likes big sweaty women?
Jordan	Watched Angles promo and it just reminded me of the Carvahlo putting challenge from the Simpsons... they've fucked it haven't they
The Wrestler	Using Stone Cold to promote shampoo. Really? Seriously? Fucking hell.
future cartoonist	And considering the "talent" they have on commentary set up for WWE Evolution it's no surprise they have Cole out there. Renee talks in sound bites or screams into the mic (seriously don't wear headphones it'll kill you) and Beth isn't regularly on commentary and might be a little rusty or really bad especially since Vince will probably be in her ear. So I see why they need Cole, though I'd take Mauro as the better choice or Phillips even.
Jason Hills	That Bishop Brennan reference at the beginning üòÇ
ben tramer	Roman is fine ! It's all a work !!!
Miguel Angel	Drew going to be added to Crown Jewel and win the title
Terrence Noran	Well, who should they replace Maggle with in Evolution?  Hopefully not Steph.
Chris Barnes	Oh god....I've got to kick  Ross Tweddell Up The Arse !!!!
Ready Red	I always wanted Roman to cut a promo from the heart and when he finally did I weeped like a baby. I see what Vince sees in him now. Really hope this guy kicks cancers ass again.
Keyse Pulliam	Going to miss you saying- "The Big Dog!"
Thor Odinson	Roman will still kick out at 2
JoeyKAllDay22	Ross only owns 4 different shirts
JosephTheMighty	This really sucks. Hope he gets better. On a lighter note, the title makes it sound like Ambrose turned heel as a reaction to the leukemia announcement.
Andy Dick	Ross, bring back the "I push my fingers into my eyes" bit if at all possible. If not I understand... it was a "Kings" thing.
STD oish	oh i hate michale cole more than anyone in this business
KarlsNotGreat	Lovely Father Ted reference at the start
Anonymous Maaan	Thank you Ross for making me feel better after the tragic news
Gorilla Glue Expert	Ross is growing that John Cena hair
Ronda Rousey	Get better roman and come back stronger
The Miz	Roman will defeat Leukaemia
Ian Moloney	He kicked king Ross up the arse!!
Seth Freakin Rollins	I've said it on a Wrestletalk video but why not say it again. I think that Ambrose has turned heel with Vince expecting him to get the Ciampa type of heel reaction, after hugging it out in tears and right after winning the Tag Titles. I think it was pretty much a last minute change.
MEGA PLANET AWSOME	Love you Rossüòòüòòüòò
John Whittington	Little Farther Ted Reference there
maccajames28	They showed cultaholics game review when they where showing the game on raw
Jonah Paris	Somewhere in the middle
