Eric Y	Dissapointing that Drake opened up for them but on the other hand it's nice to see Usher coming through. I hope they continue to have success.  Their albums are addicting.
Elijah Pantoja	At first I always thought it sucked for nineteen to never get love as the other half and producer of dvsn but after seeing them live and meeting him this past year it almost feels like he'd prefer it that way so now I'm just confused but hoping he gets the recognition he deserves but also wants, shouts to the producers in the game!
