Bryce Ford	Dear One Plus Please please drop the Dash Charge and move to Quick Charge Even if Dash is slightly superior there is enough confusion between non tech type about different amperage in USB block without having to explain multiple type of fast charging Also being able to fast charge with the laptop usb c charger I already carry around that can Quick Charge any other big name Android phone on the market would be pretty sweet Other than that I love the product particularly the quick update and pure android experience

Atul Lall	NEVER EVER buy a OnePlus phone They re garbage The quality control is awful the customer service is even worse I bought a OP 5T roughly 10 day after I received it the entire display assembly separated from the phone s frame body Turns out the back frame wa warped the glue for the screen failed This also allowed moisture dirt to get inside the phone What s worse is I wa in the hospital for a major surgery and what thought to be cancer at the time I received the phone Oneplus customer service wa awful and did nothing for me They refused to replace the phone wanted me to send paper and personal document to prove I wa in the hospital They spent 4 month arguing with me via email even had employee lie to me about being a supervisor They refused to honor the warranty they caused me so much stress when I wa trying to recover from major surgery biopsy It took 6 month to get then to agree to at least repair the phone after I sent the phone to them they rescinded the offer to fix the phone and argued with me for another 2 month They even actually kept my device and wouldn t send it back to me I paid for that device and I own all it hardware so Oneplus basically STOLE my property A new phone should never have such issue It wa never dropped or anything I also found several forum where many other people had the same issue dating all the way back to the OnePlus 1 To make thing even worse the OnePlus website wa hacked and they didn t realize the breach for 3 month My credit card info wa stolen from when I purchased my phone and I had several fraudulent charge on my credit card Can imagine having major surgery and worrying about if you have cancer or not and then having to deal with BS like this all over a phone OnePlus is horrible company and doe not deserve your business or hard earned money In order to have the price Oneplus doe they have to cut corner in certain area Yes when the phone worked it wa great but just wait until something go wrong with your device and you need some help or service and you ll see just how bad of a company Oneplus really is People forget that it s not just about the physical product the customer service and ethic of a company really matter too Chinese company are shady and everything that come out of China is questionable at best Buy Chinese Oneplus product at your own risk

Jem Walker	I ll miss the headphone jack co I m a big believer in the principle that keeping some low fi legacy tech in these thing make them more reliable and rugged in the long run but I can see why they felt that it wasn t worth keeping given that it s already been pretty much condemned by apple that aside this phone look truly awesome I especially love the fingerprint sensor even if it s still a tad slow a sensor built into the screen is pure sci fi porn

Viktor Chemelekov	Heads UP everyone If you go and buy this phone from TMobile and you re not on their postpaid plan the 579 version of the One Plus 6t WILL COST YOU ANOTHER 40 In fact even if you ve been their customer for year but have a prepaid plan with them it will still cost you extra Just FYI that s 40 tax you pay for a locked phone that will support one SIM card instead of two and you will be at the mercy of the Uncarrier for software update Ye be warned

Calum Atkinson	I ve had and hopefully will have my 5T for a while and i m really happy about that i love the finger print reader on the 5t and wasn t a fan of the smaller one on the 6 or this screen based one on the 6t And I would really still like an aux personally At this point i don t even mind the notch and improved battery is good though it already seems fantastic on the 5t let alone the 6 and 6t I guess I hope either the 7 or 7t manages to keep improving but find a way to have a more 5t style fingerprint reader and an aux

rhythm451	Dnt know y everyone complaining always loved the headphone jack but never really used it every time I get in my car it s always bluetooth not to mention some of the best headphone in the market are wireless And tbh wa never a fan of finger print scanner on back of phone 3t wa one of the best phone from OnePlus and I loved the front facing finger print scanner and now they brought that design back And really people weren t some of u the same one s that were complaining about the rear finger print scanner when phone started shifting over to tht design Seems like all u guy do is complain üòíüòî

Onat guzel	As a Oneplus 6 user I wouldn t change my phone even if they offered for free If you re planning on buying Oneplus just stick to the 6 That onscreen fingerprint sensor is just nonsense Removing the jack for battery and the sensor is not worth it when there is this thing called the dash charge

Charlie Edgington	Thanks for a good overview my conclusion disappointed Why Losing the headphone socket bringing notch size down from OnePlus 6 is alright but did not need to do it front screen is a gimmick versus the very good OnePlus 6 unlock on the back in fact a I read review it could a irritating a the iPhone 6 fingerprint button which is always needing a reset and it is going to be irritatingly bright Camera change coming to OnePlus 6 for main camera so no real gain here Bigger battery seems to be the only real gain here This is clearly a small improvement and I wanted them to get their camera up to compete the top of the market That would seal it

CaptainCoolpants101	Loving all these feature But I really hate the fact that you have to wake the screen up with the power button first then tap the screen or wait for face unlock Why not just skip the middleman and put the fingerprint reader in the power button itself Its just faster and easier for 1 handed operation a you don t have to move your hand around a much Other company have done it so I know it can be done Phones will always need a power button so a real fingerprint reader can always be present These underscreen reader are cool but totally unnecessary and according to oneplus took up the space for the headphone jack
Aston Mathew	Hey MB which one is more value for money Poco F1 or 6t

Robert Luten	I always like to compare these review with my own phone and when you mentioned the battery I thought the one plus would beat my Nokia 7 plus which ha a headphone jack but you said you had almost 6 hour of screen time which is already impressive but my record with the Nokia is 6hrs45minutes of screen time on a full charge and it ‚Äô s pretty consistent in this Considering I only paid ‚Ç¨320 for it I ‚Äô d say it ‚Äô s pretty good It also run on Android pie since it ‚Äô s an Android one device

Razey	I ll admit I wa pissed off when OnePlus announced they were removing the headphone jack But now that I think about it it s honestly not that bad This phone ha great spec and cost a lot le than other flagship phone While you can t listen and charge at the same time you can purchase a cheap pair of wireless earphone or the upcoming OnePlus Type C earphone I seriously doubt you are charging and listening all the time and with a larger battery life and quick charging it s not a bad compromise In my opinion I think this trend of having no headphone jack on phone are becoming more prevalent and sooner or later all the big company will soon scrap it

mypd1991	Hey so I don t know if this is already a thing but what if you could have a completely bezel le phone With the camera under the display and glass using a kinda transparent display and 1 way mirror type backing Maybe they could have a small part of screen wherever the camera is be transparent like with some kind of transparent display tech with a 1 way mirror type backing so the camera could still see through but you wouldn t be able to see the camera under the screen There might be a difference in quality on that small portion of the screen where it would have to be transparent if this is even possible also there could possibly be some kinda of camera light interference from whatever color the display is emitting mixing with the color the camera is intaking So I dont even know if this is possible but I just had an idea after seeing how small these notch are becoming

David Dixon	I don t get it Soooo Samsung is the only company smart enough to figure out how to make an epic phone awesome battery AND STILL include a headphone jack Either Samsung is just smarter than every company or these company are just full of shit Awesome looking phone but I don t respect these new company just taking apple design and copying it Be original

Nick Petrilli	I absolutely love One My 5 finally bit the dust the other day and I m heartbroken Perfect timing to get a 6T though
Kiranpal Singh	omiting the 3 5mm jack mean the type c port will be utilized nearly twice a much and there will be a possibility of damage due to over use of jack
Its ur boi e	Should i trade my x max for the one plus
tirken eowin	a few problem with your video you state that the starting price of the oneplus 6t is the same a the starting price of the oneplus 6 it s not the 6 started at US 529 the 6t start at 549 albiet with more storage but you state that they added the storage and kept the same price which is false also you state that they kept the same camera from last year s phone The oneplus 6 wa released 5 month ago and re introduced OIS missing since the 3t

Aluzcz	I think this is close to how iPhone would look like when Jobs would be alive current iPhones have zero innovation This is proper innovation last but not least this device will work even after year there is not inbuilt or sw pushed obsoletes I had the original oneplus one had it for 4 year and it worked perfectly after that i switched to 5t which still work and it work great Now I m tempted to buy this but just because I m getting some cash from my employer ever some time to buy a new device without it i would not even consider a the current device is great The only letdown is no headphone jack I hope there is USB C jack conversion in the box a otherwise for me a well a for many others this is useless and i dont talk just about listening music but mainly about work i need to make many call from my phone during the day and the most reliable and comfortable is standard wired headset it work every time you need it and the quality is good

Shakeeb	As much a I admire the value you get for your money with one plus I am not impressed with their service on the return exchange side of thing I bought the one plus and in the first week the glass screen protector that I bought with the phone broke in my pocket without any pressure on it The face recognition also isn t great a it unlocks with other guy who have similar facial hair a me When I told OnePlus about this issue they wanted me to send my phone and inspect it I would basically be left without a phone for 2 week and I noticed 4 month down the line that the glass on the camera ha cracked Overall I would love oneplus to be more understanding of the issue customer face and give atleast a replacement for the faulty phone
Lukekboy	october 2018
Nitin Arun	I currently have still been sticking to my Nexus 6p because I couldn t find a phone that really interested me and had all the need I wanted When the OnePlus 6 came out it did satisfy my need but I couldn t afford it at the time but now with the One plus 6T having that same price with all of the new feature most definitely gon na be my next phone
macarari	I m sad they got rid of the headphone jack and the sensor on the back Bigger battery is a major go and waterproof
Tomas Shalkauskas	That s why i Chosƒó 6 but not 6t because of mini jack and much more storage 256 GB and 8GB Ram why do you need finger print than it open by face i dobt need that finger print and lose mini jack that why i chose 6 and for more resonable price

Alex Hernandez	I want to keep the jack I love it And it seems a lot more reliable then Bluetooth forsure But I also see a lot of people going wireless so the jack death is sure to come sooner then we like And I ‚Äô m a iPhone8 user been a Apple costumer for four year and I have to say they lack innovation Also the XR IS A JOKE The price is a shame and the thing doesn ‚Äô t display 1080 p just horrible

JR Zeebs	Honestly it seems like a 6 that ha le a focus on practicality and more towards the unnecessary such a in screen finger print scanner which is much slower than the on screen scanner on the 6 plus it requires the screen to get bright Also assuming you hide the notch the top bezel will be practically the exact same between both phone Also the 6 ha a notification light but I m assuming the 6T doesn t anymore I mean considering it s the same price though I can t complain Bigger battery is always a plus but rip the headphone jack hopefully they ll be able to bring it back in the future once the technology take up le space

Shiladitya Biswas	In Display fingerprint look good feel trendy show off able but it NOT practical and functional In a normal fingerprint sensor Where it is placed at the back of the phone are the most ergonomic and practical one IMHO It is where our finger place naturally For In Display sensor we have to use two hand to unlock a phone turning the screen on with one hand and place finger of the other hand It is also even slower than the regular one Too clumsy IMO On the other hand I also like how Samsung ha shifted sensor from the back of the screen to the lock button at the side of the phone in some of it latest phone

Bradford D'souza	I get it removing the headphone jack is a big deal But is it really Initially I too wa dead against it when Apple first removed it But now that all other manufacturer are heading in the same direction it got me thinking how much of an inconvenience is it really Headphone user are of two type 1 Bluetooth headphone user who won t have any issue with the removal of the headphone jack and 2 Wired headphone user who just have to keep the provided dongle attached to their exisiting headphone of choice in whatever bag pouch pocket they re already carrying their wired headphone in Which IMO isn t THAT big a deal a people are making it out to be For eg Calling it a deal breaker for an otherwise really great phone

Nipun Sharma	I had the OP 1 OP 2 and both had gyroscope issue in gaming I held on till the OP 6 and it too had gyroscope issue in gaming The vibration motor wa really bad Made it feel I wa using a budget phone from 2011 The speaker wa the worst thing I ever heard on a phone One can see where they ve cut corner Add to this the still absent wireless charging no IP rating and now the omission of the headphone jack It s all good for the price The trick lie in how you narrate it It s all about perspective For someone who value all these thing this is a rip off at 549 especially when the Galaxy S9 is available at a very similar price Even last year s Note8 is very compelling Again it s how you look at it
Siggy Tetteh	Definitely my next phone up from the OP 5T Thanks for the video
AmazinA100	Sad that Apple Watch only work with iPhone ‚åöÔ∏è 0 45

Mr. L	If you aren t an extremely avid non bluetooth headphone user on a fool still trapped in iOS this ha got to be the best phone in age The minimalist bezel design finally perfected IMO really adore the design And the only compromise I see are No headphone jack not the literally best display ie not Note 9 but still incredible display not the literally best camera but exponentially beter phone than the one with the best camera and the lack of headphone jack But those I only put in there to prevent reply saying samsung screen are better and such normally I d just say this is the best phone of the past 2 year which cut no corner Edit No expandable storage and more flex than I like to see during JerryRigEveryThing s bend test are also downside Still my pick of the year though

Der Red	Probably not my next phone because it lack a headphone jack which I use especially when my Bluetooth one run out which is most day Second reason is the lack of wireless charging That being said I ‚Äô m still on an iPhone 6 and it ‚Äô s still working so I ‚Äô m not chomping at the bit to fork over money for a phone I don ‚Äô t need Thus I have time to change my opinion about the lack of wireless charging and Jack and time for more phone to become available that are potentially better

Recoo Recoo	Review Huawei mate 20x pls
levi nouah	I personally would prefer a headphone jack than a larger battery and inscreen fingerprint reader just because of convenience The fingerprint reader seems like a gimmick while the larger battery is more practical the battery isn t a whole lot bigger and for sacrificing the jack it just seems to not be worth it for the amount of hassle I have to go through to use my headphone Given that OP6 ha dash charging I don t really see the point of a bigger battery either since most people have powerbanks or access to a powerpoint sometime during their daily life Overall i m just disappointed that OP decided to follow the market trend despite saying they listen to the customer

Jacob Penner	I ve always been interested in Oneplus phone but unfortunately we can t get them on contract through our carrier here in Canada where we are used to buying phone for next to nothing on 2 year contract That mean soon I ll be able to get the Mate 20 Pro for 0 on contract because Huawei phone don t sell well here but would have to pay 719 CAD plus tax over 800 CAD to get the 6T Reason why almost no one buy a Oneplus in North America

Stephen Bannister	Oneplus designed phone that people were impressed with They have a loyal fan which oneplus said that 80 percent of their customer used their headphone jack and we re here for are customer and what the customer want they will do This why there s uproar I do believe from the response on YouTube in the few hour will see a return of this jack because oneplus ha many fan I believe they although said wireless headphone were good but below 200 dollar wa very limited compared to good quality wire headphone with a lot of people actually own a really good pair that cover the entire ear and have excellent sound quality at fraction of the cost of wireless to match there is also quite a few people using 3 5 to a source there music there s are few phone company s keeping this because they listen i think company that is listening to consumer is great thing and believe you may see a return on the oneplus 7

Raystar89 Magic	Pretty disappointed with the OnePlus 6T I previously owned a OnePlus 3T and to be honest this feel the same I think OnePlus should focus on making one model and drop the ‚Äò T ‚Äô model One issue with 3T is the brightness in the ray of the sun They need to improve this aspect of there device

K√•re Falk	On screen fingerprint sensor is the dumbest invention since the notch You add another step to unlocking the phone you have to turn it on and then unlock it I enjoy being able to unlock my phone instantly the moment I pick it up
Mike Ramage	I don t mind getting rid of the headphone jack my only issue is that the replacement go through the charging port other than bluetooth But not because I can t charge my phone and listen to music honestly never done that really a if i m at home it ll be from my computer and if i m out i m obviously not charging it The issue is that I always have a problem with my charge port no matter how much I try to keep them clean after about a year they always start to fail for example I ve had my usb type C one plus 3t for two year and after a year it lost the ability to fast charge a the connection have failed and now i have to leave it in a very specific spot for it to charge at all If i m out and about using the charge port a lot for headphone surely it s going to fail way quicker anybody with any tip to keeping a charge port working for longer than a year i d love to hear it

J.

stiefdb	If 6T had the Pixel camera and software for 100 more buck it would almost be a no brainer About the inscreen fingerprint reader to be honest it s not really my thing I love the fact that on my 5T I can open my notification drawer by sliding up and down the back fingerprint reader Since I tend to use my phone a lot for reading in bed the full brightness kicking in for the fingerprint is kind of a bad thing Nice look to the phone glass really not needed imo

Just Gusta_Cz	The OnePlus 6T s teardrop notch implementation is the best I ve ever seen and I just want that phone We can already predict how 2019 phone will look like 2018 wa a year of lot relatively big notch now that we are approaching new year we are getting smaller and smaller notch So obviously Samsung Galaxy S10 will be the one phone that will completely get rid of the notch but what will be after that Technology never cease to amaze me

ewizzle1978	price is really nice Sweet spot I think No wireless charging and no stereo speaker are a bigger bummer for me than I think for most look badass tho Intrigued by the UI tweak With the pixel 3 being not very impressive an upgrade I wa kicking around the 6T to replace by P2XL but the camera is clearly a full step below Hope somebody doe a really thorough side by side of the software difference from stock android Maybe One Plus should do a higher end flagship too One Plus 7 Ultra or something Include the shortcut they are making to shave the price Wireless charging better speaker upgraded camera IP rating etc

jk jk	This phone ha an amazing value but I think the OnePlus 6 ha the better value just for that headphone jack and back fingerprint I use the headphone jack everyday and it s too big of a trade off for me Also that in display fingerprint reader wa a gamble and hurt the experience of the phone Remember OnePlus ha always been known for performance and speed having a slow fingerprint chop a big chunk of the experience of the phone That huge battery is an amazing improvement and is worth it

Isak s	My problem with this phone is that it doesn t have a headphone jack I bought the galaxy s9 cause there wa pretty much nothing else interesting that both had and oled and a headphone jack But the fingerprint reader under the screen is nothing more than a gimmick I don t like having the fingerprint reader on the front cause it just doesn t feel a smooth when unlocking a having it on the back in my opinion

Lethal Stinger	Finally The corner are rounded at the top of the phone when you hide the notch
Ikpegbu Tochukwu	Don t know why people like this indisplay fingerprint scanner it s a horrible implementation imagine when the screen damage you won t be able to unlock your phone if the fingerprint wa the only way you used to have access to your phone you gon na have to replace the screen which will cost way more than the ordinary normal screen Leaving out the headphone jack wa a stupid thing I rather have a phone that lag that ha a headphone jack than get one of those crappy bluetooth headphone that sound awful

Lloyd Pliskin	The intro volume is louder than usual
P.V.N SRINATH	I have a small doubt if phone is lock and screen off then if we want to unlock phone then we can directly keep fingerprint on the screen or we have to wakeup screen and then keep
William Amundson	Marques I can live without the notch or the fingerprint scanner the battery would be the only the upgrade I would be looking for Do you think that once the 6T go on sale will they lower the price of the regular 6 And if so would you consider the 6 upgrade to be worth the premium price

KungFuMedia	I ve had my Galaxy S7 going on two ish year now and it s treated me fairly well but I am really starting to want an upgrade with all of the thing I missed on the S7 I got my S7 oblivious to the fact the S8 would come only a month or so later and I think the 6T would be a seriously solid upgrade without destroying the bank account My biggest gripe is the absence of an audio jack but I think I could get past that with a tiny adapter and the fact of the new battery and screen fingerprint sensor

Fremy Gonzales	LOL you can tell how slow that in display that would be such an annoying way to unlock the phone If you have the OP6 there s no reason to upgrade when it s basically the same phone It s only the battery that would make me think twice but then again dash charging is there so that compensate with it How is a slower in display scanner an improvement
Artur Garncarz	So do I have to turn on the display and then use my finger to unblock it
Kenneth Hudgins	Galaxy s8 user here Coming from a crappy asian nomu s30 that could barely get signal in the USA and a Lumia 1520 window phone before that I think I m good right now My s8 is still great both in performance and look The galaxy s10 concept look cool but thing have gotten so good now that I m going to need a bigger reason drop that kind of cash on a phone again Got my s8 for 500 practically brand new off of ebay 4 month before the 9 came out

Mathias	I gave it some thought and for now I am fine with notch It just sits there at the top and I watch Youtube video in 16 9 I wouldn t even notice it And by the time wider aspect ratio become the standard on Youtube we will have sensor and camera under the screen Samsung is working on that already I give it two year top until we see selfie cam under the display Also I get why they removed the Jack Keeping it mean it take up space So you either can t put in new hardware feature or you have to build other part smaller Miniaturization cost a LOT in R D So you either give Jack the boot and sell your phone with a cheap dongle or you put a lot of resource into R D for the sole reason of keeping a connector standard that is over 100 year old and customer will complain because suddenly the phone cost 700 buck So yeah It s sad the 3 5mm jack is very handy I use bluetooth headphone but some time I forget to charge them but a long a I get a dongle in the box I am looking at you Apple and a fingerprint reader in the screen to nerd out over I can live without Jack

Wolf	OnePlus 5 is the best phone I ve ever used But thanks to No Headphone Jack I won t be getting OnePlus ever again Removing something is never be considered a one step forward It is a step backward Only a marketing strategy to earn more since a usual good quality wired earphone cost 20 compared to avg Bluetooth one which cost at least 100 Fuck You
fahad naif	What I like about one plus The stock Android and the price That s it
Mihai Petrescu	Marques Brownlee awesome video Quick question can you unlock the phone with the in display fingerprint sensor without first waking up the device I noticed in your video that every time you unlocked it with the fingerprint sensor you first pressed the power button I m asking because I tend to use my phone using only one hand and that might be a deal breaker for me Thank you in advance peace

Deeparth Gupta	I get 7 hour SOT with 30 hour life on the OP6 I m not kidding Running a clean and lean system with a custom kernel is probably a large factor I m sure I can t imagine what the 3700mah battery would be like
vishal singh	Sorry to say buts it way overrated no infrared camera only rgb camera they removed the back fingerprint which is actually the most ideal place for any fingerprint sensor and replaced it with much slower indisplay sensor no stereo sound and final nail in the coffin removed headphone jack and for that notch even the realme 2 pro ha the same type of notch üòë look like every youtuber is paid heavily for promoting this phone everyone is biased üòê

Anjalena	Marques Brownlee Please do NOT stop telling u about those small nitpicky seemingly insignificant detail around the UX user experience of a phone Most reviewer ONLY cover those thing that are relevant to most user ie the most popular function feature design aspect etc However there are MANY of u who do NOT fit that very narrow mold Each person us their own phone differently so those little nitpicky thing become VERY important to people who don t necessarily use their phone exactly the same way a the mass Groups of people that Reviewers almost always forget when covering feature and design element of a new phone Elderly Disabled my group By remembering to cover those small detail Marques you include those forgotten group to let them know of feature that might be important to them So thank you

Fluffy Greyfoot	TBH smartphones a a whole are getting more unappealing to me Looking back at phone from a few year ago there were much more diverse option Nowadays they re all the same and there s nothing that I feel like buying Back in 2013 we had the choice of thing like the Galaxy s4 the HTC One M7 Nexus 5 the Moto X and the iPhone 5 Different phone were actually you know different from each other back then Since 2016 they ve started to become more and more boring and removing feature hell maybe it started in 2015 with the Galaxy s6

mohamed salama	Cant they hide the camera under the glass instead of a notch
Socrates Nicolaou	I m still on my One Plus X and seeing that OnePlus is getting rid of the headphone jack is very disappointing Why would they get rid of it Also where is the micro SD card slot I want to have a set of earbuds in my pocket or backpack and know that i will just plug them in and listen to my music I don t want to worry whether they are charged or not I want to keep my phone and buy a micro SD card and boost it storage capacity This is getting out of hand because manufacturing wireless headphone with battery in them and having to buy a new device or a more expensive one for the extra storage doesn t seem healthy to my pocket and the planet I live in I bought a OnePlus phone because it wa it s own thing it wa different If I wanted a device that copied every single thing the iPhone did I would buy a cheap iPhone knock off

Perpetratorn	Looks great I ve got the OnePlus6 and the only thing I kinda feel I m missing out on is the bigger screen and battery but having a headphone jack is a good trade and basically the reason why I bought the OP6 instead of anything else and the price ofc I m using dark mode on my phone and I try to use Amoled Black background a well and I get about 6 hour of screen time with it Never had a day when it fully discharged I ve kind of changed my charging pattern too with the Dashcharge I can just charge it for half an hour or so when I m going to bed then unplug and have it in bed listening to YT when going to sleep no need to keep it charging all night a I m used too Feels safer and I m never below 85 in the morning 85 still take me through a full day too Love the new look but I m kinda pissy about them removing the headphone jack that s going in the wrong direction imho Don t remove feature add them

Shailansh Gaur	OnePlus and google got fucked up for both 6t and 3xl
Hakim Din	Coming from a 5T user this phone actually disappoint me when they remove the headphone jack and the fingerprint sensor at the back The sensor in 5T and 6 is actually the feature that i like You have a very fast response sensor to unlock your phone compare with this 6T and the position at the back is just natural for you to put your index finger there So it really easy for me to unlock the phone without pressing the power button first or if i m using an apps while using one hand and i want to slide down the notification bar Watch unbox therapy review about the 5T if you don t understand what i m talking about

Maxxwell Walt	OnePlus are complete liar No space for headphone jack Whats wrong if they just say they ve decided to copy Apple Vivo Nex S ha alomst the same body size a OnePlus 6T a 6 5 screen on Vivo and 6 4 on 6T Yet Vivo also ha the under the display optical fingerprint reader a 4000mah FOUR THOUSAND Battery A Motorized POP UP front facing camera if you need to see how this Motorized POP UP camera system take space go see JerryRigEverything teardown of the Vivo and Still the Vivo Nex S ha the Headphone jack These manufacture have just found a way to make people pay more in the name of the future technology Well this is not a goodbye to the headphone jack Its a goodbye to Quality Audio that could be improved to reach HiFi studio quality audio on the go a LG phone do provide a least there is a last man standing for how long that we do not know

PRATEEK DUTT	6 is better than 6t
PROANISH	This is my only thing I ‚Äô d like to state I love how that finger print reader is under the screen but see this is where people will attack me for saying this Eventually if apple doe decide to use that tech in the iPhone they will wait around maybe 4 year so all these little thing that are kinda small but still an inconvenience will go away and the tech will be there to support it But everyone will say apple is copying and cant do anything new From my perspective this is some dope as tech but I can ‚Äô t wait till apple adopts it and we see a different side of it maybe apple will make the entire screen the reader so you can place your finger any where you want

Sreeraj P	Vivo Nex ha a In Display FP Scanner and a larger 4000 mAh battery still they have space for headphone jack And OP6T doesn t why It s just following the trend and Oneplus team told somewhere that lot of their user are using wireless heaphones so that they re going for no headphone jack or something like that And one more thing it s NEVER SETTLE and you can t charge your phone while listening to music üòÇ

The Applecolipse	teardrop notch design is the most elegant execution of the notch it feel more like a design rather than a poor attempt to increase screen real estate by all mean necessary the nitpick about the fingerprint sensor kinda make no sense either way if you gon na unlock your phone at night the screen is going shine to your face anyway after unlocking the phone even if it doesnt do so at full brightness

nco405	Finally a sexy notch Classy design and not akward looking Honestly the overall upgrade just wow I m a owner of the 5T at first a good phone but when it s your daily driver you get to see the short corner that one plus take I wouldn t go again for oneplus But know seeing that one Arrrg Oneplus is back in my mind Well played The only downside is the headphone jack Yes everyone ha Bluetooth But that jack is there when you need it It s tiny detail that you don t pay attention when you have it but make a difference when they are removed and you need it

lumi	I would have to agree that the 6T isn t a big upgrade in term of spec but it is a huge change simply because it s compatible with Verizon and maybe Tmobile down the line You have to keep in mind that not everyone can even use the OP6 a a daily driver simply because it didn t support their carrier before

Mandala Putra	Hey marque where did you get that wallpaper from
kraftyw1999	I just bought the OnePlus 6 several week ago specifically in anticipation of the OP 6T and it omission of the headphone jack and in screen fingerprint reader As far a I can work out the 6T is just a flashier 6 with some added inconvenience under the hood The omission of the headphone jack is at best an inconvenience the inclusion of an in screen fingerprint reader is a superfluous gimmick which is slower than a conventional sensor I m sure it s beautifully made I applaud OnePlus effort to reduce the size of the notch and I m glad it will make it to Verizon but I do think this phone make too many compromise to be considered a genuine upgrade

Ares	OnePlus sixty
Atul Pandey	Prob is dat mkbhd carry an iPhone x along with his android phone so most of the thing which suck abt one plus are more or le covered by iPhone n he doesn t miss thing like a mediocre camera or screen etc As a standalone phone it s difficult to recommend one plus over something like a LG g7 or note 8 which roughly cost d same in India if u know how to find a deal or maybe Asus 5z which cost inr 10k le n doe everything d same One plus ha betr software but Asus is betr in audio camera build n battery life

SmileOverlord	so let me get this straight 1 they swapped the instant fingerprint sensor on the back with a slower one that even get annoying in night time 2 they REMOVED a feature which everyone praised them for keeping it the headphone jack 3 they removed LED notification in exchange in a smaller notch which i don t see the benefit of yet 4 they slightly increased the battery size which wa a you said in your review of the 6 not a problem even without having wireless charging due to the super fast dash charging yeah the 6T is a downgrade for the same price literally the only positive thing about it is slightly increased battery size every other change is a downgrade IMO shame to see OnePlus falling for market trend instead of Listening to their customer and thank god a bought a OnePlus 6 3 week ago

Vijay Balsubramaniam	I think the biggest area according to me from one plus is that they do not support band across all carrier which give them a small market to sell their phone Their 1 6T is awesone but should cater to all carrier which will boom boost their sale and they can even overtake iph and sam in the market I use one plus 3 but i have limitation to 2 3 carrier only i want to use one plus but do not have the flexibility MKBHD sir let me know ur view in this and whether one plus should focus on this area I am a one plus fan from last 5 year

Abdullah _sav	Liking this video for that notch pun already
Filippos Bamopoulos	If we re gon na call this an incremental update we might a well call every update that
THE ICON	You forgot to say that even though it s only for the USA that you get three hundred buck back on a plethora of fold including all the entire history of the OnePlus also that they have a DAC in the bottom even though they don t have an earphone jack but they included a dongle so that s pretty impressive I m not sure if the earphone come with it if it doe at least it s at the value of 20 buck not the wireless but still that s pretty impressive but going back to the phone thank you for the feedback on the fingerprint reader that s good to know but I think when you trade in your phone for some people like that have an eligible phone it work out to almost 11 a month extra instead of the standard 30 buck that you would get 4 000 phone so this is by any mean very acceptable I can t wait to see the 7 and send it to you and if they have it treated for those every 6 month at least until the 70 come out I have a 3 T which I upgraded from the one original with Cyanogen on it I am super impressed with the Hawaii meat 20 Pro and equally impressed with the note 9 still so the price is really what selling me on upgrading from the 3T which by the way wa supported over three OS update it came with the six went to the seven went to the 8th and we ll get the 9 in January for first quarter so they really take care of their customer still which is great

Adam Macias	He s so excited he said forget the Impressions I agree with quite a bit of what you said One Plus is making amazing move in their company but they got to be careful not to go too fast with spec or feature like the screen unlock feature to make compromise in getting rid of other feature people probably cared more about like the headphone jack Also at 5 01 I see real recognize real

MR Dot1	i had the impression that they would use Qualcomm s ultrasonic reader cuz they use the Snapdragon 845 but it seems it not the case
Owen wandy	Please can I have a oneplus 6T ‚ô•Ô∏è
Prajjwal Laad	What s that calendar widget
Dpak	screen unlock and no headphone jack üëé
Dion Tholen	It s not the same price tough is it The oneplus 6 started at 529 for the 64GB model The 6T start at 549 for the 128GB model So you still get double the storage for only 20 more but OnePlus ha been driving the price up each year with 20 30 Not a good look imo
Tobias Grund	Wow I tought it can t be better but I wa wrong Here in germany the 8 128GB model is only 10 ‚Ç¨ more expensive a the 6 with 8 128GB So this is very OK By the way I love it they threw out the headphonejack
Savva Moser	I feel like OnePlus should stop with the two model a year thing and just stick with the T cycle
Moldy Hunter	Who else is watching this on Nokia 3300
Hrithik Jeet Sharma	Wallpaper
Muzik l	For me I guess finger print sensor at back the still the best onee
Shady 7	Wallpaper
Rohil Jain	Drawback of in glass fingerprint scanner that we need to press turn on and off button every time lil inconvenient
Harish Bharath	IMO the indisplay fingerprint scanner is useless I think they ve had it just to show it a an upgrade and also because their sub company have adopted it Physical fingerprint scanner FTW And they could have easily kept the headphone jack instead of telling u silly reason like other company According to me the OP3 and 3T are the best OP phone ever
Saad Kidwai	Nice Can t wait for it to come to Aus That Mirror black
Harshal Maheshkar	I wanted to see your video first on ONEPLUS 6T

Louis Law Weize	He asked is this your next phone a if we re changing phone every 6 month ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Holip sism	Yes Marques This is my next phone
Raymond Jones	Sad to hear about the headphone jack it really is The Oppo R17 ha the same design an in display fingerprint sensor and still ha a headphone jack What about the battery Remember when the OnePlus 3T got a 3400 MAH battery when the 3 only had 3000 They increased the MAH by 400 with the exact same chassis No one is really providing u with a transparent motivation a to why they want to remove the headphone jack Other than that this is almost a perfect phone Great video a always
Aleksandr Vysockij	Forgot to say the same shit speaker Honestly no damn given about the in screen finger print sensor they start sounding like Samsung pretending thing are more important than they are If Google allowed a secure enclave for facial recognition all phone would be copying FaceID which is superior in ease of use in comparison to any fingerprint sensor Honestly I love the company and their strategy but they seem to start making a big deal about thing that really isn t a big deal I have doubt everyone is racing to put the fingerprint sensor under the screen if they were that d have already happened but it hasn t For anyone that ha 549 to spend there s clearly no better option but I really wished for good speaker and given the glass back wireless charging After trying the 3T I m back on iPhone and maybe one day OnePlus will convince me that it s worth leaving iOS and the ecosystem But today isn t that day a while their performance seems superior there s still lack of attention to smaller detail that others have taken care of year ago
Lewys Cousins	I can t believe they used your video in their actual presentation it wa so funny üòÇ
Carlos David Castillejo Flores	Where can I get that wallpaper
Yi Hsing Lee	I think this notch is perfectly small and is a huge improve in design but the problem with unlocking your phone in darkness is really kind of annoying for me too I get that it s a new fingerprint scanner technology but I got ta admit that it s a lot satisfying with lightning fast fingerprint scanner rather than this one I ve got a phone with infrared ray face recognition which is super fast and work perfectly in darkness a well so I kinda feel how important it is to have fast and reliable unlocking system
Alez TehCat	I swear I m buying this when I get the chance

Blake Forsyth	Why no Australian release Buying flagship phone outright is just not worth it anymore Almost all flagship google samsung apple huawei etc are well over 1100 for the cheapest lowest spec option It s annoying see other country get better bang for the buck option when all we get is cheap crap or over priced flagship I still believe that consumer shouldn t be paying more than 1000 for a phone that can last a minimum of 2 3 year before it spontaneously ha a battery problem bootloop broken screen or software issue

Unchained Spirit	Good upgrade but I would still choose a samsung galaxy 9 or even 8 over it due to the lack of expandable storage and now the loss of the headphone jack I loved the stock android experience but that ‚Äô s not enough to make me choose this phone anymore Not to mention lack of water resistance which caused my OnePlus 3t to malfunction What reason could there be for not including wireless charging That ‚Äô s the standard now
