Sofi sofiyyah	What an incredibly unprofessional interview To continue asking him question about his father when he ’ s expressed his discomfort physically and egging him on for a reaction is SO messed up Have you thought about your audience Do you seriously think new fan or existing fan of Kris would want to see him unearthing trauma brought on by your highly unprofessional invasive poorly written and poorly researched question Congratulations on making the WORST out of an opportunity to interview such an important figure of the Chinese music community Instead of focusing on milestone like Kris ’ album his bridging of the East and West through music and even his acting career you chose to focus on the uncomfortable question that clearly have no connection to his artistry An awful travesty Congratulations on exploiting the kindness and respectfulness of Kris while exhibiting absolutely no tact Kris may not have said anything to your face but I assure you your unprofessionalism will warrant future celebs not being a kind to you Your lack of self awareness and emotional intelligence is pitiful

A 88	It would ’ ve been nice for the interviewer to actually do research on Kpop if he ’ s going to ask question about it “ so you make it into this group but you ’ re not Korean ” nooo way really He ’ s not Korean “ You learned how to speak Korean ” no shit nah he spoke Chinese and English in a country that speaks Korean in a group that performs and speaks purely in Korean “ In the boy group were you singing ” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ Also the interviewer just sound plain patronising He could be a great guy for all I know but 1 He ’ s not even in the shot which just make him seem more condescending 2 He talk about himself way too much and stuff like how he just interviewed Jay Park and they ’ re so “ similar ” 3 He asks way too much about his dad like why would we need to know so much detail this isn ’ t a therapy session 4 Instead of just asking question he pose them a “ so when you were you did ” like he ’ s some job interviewer reading a resume 5 It felt like he kept waiting for Kris to say stuff rather than him leading the conversation so Kris is just left there smiling awkwardly I don ’ t know Kris Wu well but I can ’ t believe he just sat there and continued the interview Must be a pretty chilled guy to deal with that

sokerisade	Everyone in the comment selection is complaining about the interview because ” the interviewer made him uncomfortable by pushing him to talk about his father ” Look this come from someone who grew up without a father too someone who ha only once met him and wa too young to remember it someone who only know the name and hometown of their father simply talking about his father doesn ’ t make Kris uncomfortable it ’ s that he really doesn ’ t have an answer He want to give the interviewer a proper answer that answer to the question who where when and why But he doesn ’ t know all the answer Why Because he doesn ’ t know his father Talking about him doesn ’ t make Kris sad or angry It doesn ’ t cause any emotion And the interviewer only asking so many question because the topic is interesting due the fact that in most case even if someone ’ s parent break up they still keep seeing both of them for example at holiday or being a week with one parent and another week with another parent And don ’ t lie and say that you haven ’ t ever been even the tiniest bit interested into Kris ’ family dynamic

MsTravelTheWorld	Who is Kris Wu A brave little horse Chinese zodiac to dare to say NO to evil oppression and abuse that led the way for industry change to benefit other artist and a kind giant his height for humanity to bridge the East and the West at least for hip hop music side one step at a time His voice sings for his heart of truth Oh I hope one day he will meet his dad again and father and son unite I m sure he will Of course though he love his mom so much that he will respect most certainly her will before that happens

DRAKE REDUBLA	Still cool a ever Everything he said seemed to be like a rap hahaha
GroteskAntichrist	I love Kris and I ’ m really happy he ’ s doing solo SM is just blocking talent and creativity I see Kris a a solo artist and not a a former member of EXO And I think that is what he also want
Yalie Racquel	i remember the day the news about his departure from exo broke out i literally had a mental and emotional breakdown there were alot of thing circulating around the internet about it and it didn t matter if it wa true or not but my poor young and vulnerable exo fangirl heart had it own defense mechanism for the whole situation and i just chose to believe what felt like the most comforting during that time four year later on today i feel like i ve matured enough to atleast understand what happen back then he just really wanted out of exo wanted a career path for himself but chose the wrong time to do so they were having their first concert just day before he left the whole team and fandom hanging and it wa a whole mess i would ve appreciated it more if he wa honest enough to own up to his decision on why he left back then but i also understand why he couldn t and here we finally hear the reason straight from him he just wanted his own freedom to be able to do the thing he wanted to do without maximum restriction and honestly it just great to see him doing his own thing and exo doing their own thing i guess it still worked out for both party in the end also on a side note the whole dad thing in this interview wa too much i understand that it intriguing and yea maybe interesting but it also kinda off limit he never really mentioned about his dad often and it must ve been awkward sitting through an interview being asked about a person you have the least idea of in your entire life but im just happy he got through this entire interview and i got through watching this even though it kinda painful to watch 💀
arya s	This interviewer is sick
ANN QIU	what make me more proud of him is that he nwver did say anything bad about exo after he left if he dont answer anything about it from medium he also say few good thing and now he wa actually more open about it and hearing that he treasure the memory make me more proud and that i never regret that he became my first ever bias in exo i love yoy galaxy fan ❤

Lê Dương	💖💖💖💖
good evening.	c chogiwa brother chogiwa
milksomecows	Not only is the interviewer asking question that are irrelevant to Kris music career the question are also really insensitive and the answer kind of private Plus the way he asked the question is really weird There were no emotion used in his speech Poor interview
Suho looks like a pineapple	Those glass reminds me of that orange juice
Tanaka	HE S SO FUNNY 😂😂😂
IGOT7 WITHGOT7	Why The Fuck You Asked Him These Question He Is Trying To Move On
爱丽丝	I live in Vancouver ahhhhhhh
elf_ grxce	When he said 12 member what ran through his mind wa probably how it became 11 only after he left then to the ot9 now i really hope the interviewer didn t purposely say 11 just to incite his response out of kris because he is already disrespectful enough
Emma	lol my guy definitely skimmed a wikipedia article about kris before this interview wtf
Jessica C	People are getting all up about asking disrespectful question but honestly would you rather him ask the same question that EVERYONE else asks him that we already know the answer to It s the first time that anyone ever asked him direct question about his dad instead of dancing around this question Sure they re rather provocative and probing but artist draw on their own feeling emotion and experience to influence their craft It s part of Kris identity and family and home are some major theme in some of his music and what he talk about I think it give interesting insight into Kris a an artist a a human being because a child s relationship with his parent or lack thereof can be rather telling It make me wonder how much of a pain point it is for Kris not having a father figure in his life In my eye it make him more human le like the superstar celebrity image that is projected in China
Kris Bordon	I can feel that his a bit uncomfortable talking about everything his asking But by the way Kris voice is fucking making me pregnant
Fulla Haliwel	He wa so uncomfortable I can see that charming smile hide a thousand tear😭😢 My poor baby Can u plz don t push in those question that dig dip in old scar😷

M C	It make roll my eye every time an interview asks Kris “ so u where born in China ” like fan already know that and he ’ s said it in 100 different interview ask something else
NotYourYear	for this interview and for Jay Park s this dude is just so stuck in the past like ask them about what they re doing now what they plan for in the future what they have been doing in recent time COME ON They don t want to talk about their past and most likely their not legally allowed to share a lot of information about it anyway This interviewer need to learn to pick up on sign and read body language facial expression to know when it s not okay to continue on with a topic or a question
Serra Rojas ._.	All these dad question got me fucking cringing Like what kind of disrespectful person are you

Della Mái	Why Kris get asked more about Exo than Tao Luhan Because every time I look up kris it ’ s always someone bringing up exo and mind you they went from bros to now stranger but when I look up Luhan Tao it ’ s rarely anything about talking about exo Why is it only haunting kris Low key I started listening to exo a few month ago Because I found out he wa a Scorpio and his birthday 3 day after mine just to find out he left 😭
Elin Li	心疼吴亦凡
lucky surya	I guess it s not only me who uncomfortable with the headline and the question but for the most I m happy for you Kris seriously all the hard time you ve been through took you to another level which is good I m glad you life comfortable now and how much I adore you to answer those question Stay healthy Kris💚💚💚

Brittany Blessed	This is America you guy are mad about the deep question but you know nothing about this man channel he always ask deep question and some are uncomfortable this isn ’ t kpop or even China American interview are super open and deep so kris or anyone else should do research about the show they are going on before accepting to come If y ’ all want baby question and elementary answer then don ’ t watch this channel or Wendy Williams or the breakfast club or basically any American show
kuroraini	these question are getting a bit too personal
Long Sotheary	Oppa😘😘😘 fighting U are always shine bright in this universe coz just not a star u are the galaxy
Ant-Man	What s up with the daddy question
Tori L	Hes not a kpop idol anymore He wa already aware of the question beforehand otherwise he wouldve stated he wa uncomfortable If Kris wa okay with it we should be This interview is pretty tame composed compared to a lot of american interview Yall needa chill
Oop Ireallywannacry	Man is it bad I cried during this whole interview I love kris so much it hurt so bad when he left exo but to see him flourish and be happy make me happy I ’ ll always support the boy who left I love them so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Khadijah H	omfg why do you keep asking about his dad he clearly DOES NOT want to talk about it or have nothing to say about it
Huiphoria ‘	I understand you guy don ’ t like how the man wa asking him question but you guy also have to understand that this is how he asks question to every guest he ha and more than likely kris and his management know this They must have agreed to what is okay to ask prior to doing the interview because that ’ s how these work Just chill he ’ s a grown man and can make his own decision
tacky and fabulous	Lmao when he said exo wa big at that time Is he saying they aren ’ t big anymore 😬
EYA_EXO-L	I love u kris 😙😍
Shinxran9111	This interviewer rly annoyed me omg Talk about insensitive smh half the video wa like about his father that he DOESNT want to talk about and making him uncomfortable ughhhhh what an embarrassment That guy better be switched with a new guy So terrible Kris is so strong and patient I would ’ ve just told him to shut up and not to about his father

Aissa Nadjiam	I had to skip the Dad topic love him lot
Carly Raimey	I felt so tense watching him answer the family question but I also think some people are taking this out of proportion At any moment he could have said let s talk about something else Also important to remember these are question NOBODY asks him in detail so there must be a reason DJ Vlad wa asking them in order to give fan answer judging by his expression and response it potentially wa uncomfortable for him but Kris is a grown man and can handle a some pressure We dont need to treat him like a baby he isn t one Overall good interview thanks for the upload

Francis Ann Amor	It wa quite disappointing that the host put too much attention about Kris father and how he didn t get the sense of changing the topic It make me sad in Kris part though and he is obviously not comfortable about that
Samruddhi Gudhe	The interviewer is doing such a bad job It s a miracle that Kris wa being so patient n understanding with him

Jessica Nguyen 阮希	Kris is my idol and I will support him in whatever he doe He ha worked hard ever since he wa a trainee He trained four year to be with Exo and now ha left to do his own music I myself am part chinese and can totally understand his situation after leaving Exo SM Ent and Korea So let ’ s all give him lot of love and support and buy his album Btw I really don ’ t like the title of this video I feel like their using it just to get view Also it must have been quite difficult for him to answer question about his past with Exo because there ’ s prob a lot of information he can ’ t mention and also very awkward to him

THE LOGICAL NEGRO	I watched this video just to see if Vlad the impaler would bring up some old beef that happened year ago and try to reignite it like he doe with Black people and of course he didn t
tamara sky	I m glad he learned English and changed his whole persona for himself
Rubisita Saori	Te amo Kris Wu😍
Glitchy Glitchy	Why get on the interviewer s case for asking question He s not a child who need to be coddled and avoid topic about his past at all cost He wouldn t have agreed to the interview if he wa really that uncomfortable talking about these thing Past experience make a man who he is today

Charlene Ocampo	Why d you have to pursue his family situation what s that got to do with anything The moment he said divorced you should ve just stepped back and moved on
Chuyền Hải	Kris you want to have your own solo career i can understand but you should have chosen the right time to left EXO at that time everything wa very sensitive all the member were very upset they felt like being you left the group without saying anything do you remember how worse at that time then after your left Tao and Luhan left Lay is the only China member in the group how many suffers ha he been through do you know Lay said please don t hate me when he came back to China for solo debut everything wa very bad do you know your left take how much of our tear do you know you hurt our heart both EXO and EXO L However time can erase everything we have become better hope your career going well but EXO L never forget how hurt you brought to them toKrisWu
Mandy Li	This host asked way too many question on Kris ’ s personal life You could tell he didn ’ t feel comfortable It would of been really hard to express a well The main focus should have been on his upcoming album I find it extremely rude and disrespectful
EXSOW	Yung mukha ni kris hindi maipinta nung binaggit yung exo

Master Nim	I hope you always happy kris ❤
heechulliebabo	I see this is why he missed his mom so much I also think he s really just better off being on his own given how independent he is and how much he wa influenced by hip hop As an EXO L I m glad he made it big on his own
Amal A.	He s done so many hip hop single that made him look like a totally different Kris Wu Yi Fan but here he is in this video sitting and talking and nodding and doing that thing with his eye that I know he s still the same Kris 😢 All the best Kris It s kind of cool that he and EXO are both releasing their album on 2 11 What are Tao and Luhan doing that day lol
吴夫人	kris wu😍😍😍

Yuti	The excessive digging on his relationship with his father wa unnecessary and uncomfortable Proud of Kris for handling it well I hope speaking about Exo wa comfortable for him Wish ot12 would meet sort it all out and be friend again
lai wa Ip	He contains about 43millions of fan on Weibo that ’ s why he would come back China to start his solo career a here is his home Anyway EVERYONE is waiting his first album ‘ Antares ’ on Nov2 You should probably pre order it it won ’ t make u disappointed
Baek The Puppy 'ᄉ'	He s an independent artist now they should stop asking him about the past I mean I know they ask about the past but they should not invade this much about the father he s certainly comfortable
diares em	proud dad here

张艺兴YIXINGBAOBEI	Aaaaaa k hiểu gì hết ý 凡啊，我不認識這個外語
Jswift255	Vlad asks personal question all the time in his vids Why all these kpop fan so sensitive
Red VelBaek	It s already 2018 and people are still asking him the same question over and over again It s getting really annoying to the point that I could actually feel his discomfort 😞 Anyway good luck to your new album Galaxy boy ❤
