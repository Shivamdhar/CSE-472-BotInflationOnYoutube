SepticFalcon	Of course I would be lying if I said I wa not disappointed I want that content booiiiiiiis
Daniel Palma	this wa boring
Kev Bail	Beetuh
mikeymarmalade	Basically “ we are doing fuck all of what we promised and we aren ’ t even giving you what you had before ”
glensR32	they dont care they got €60 000 000
Adeldex	dayz is not a game it a joke
HECKTOR andersson	dayz never dy it just resting untill it get finnished in 10 year
BenniBenson	All I wan na know is when is 0 63 going to stable
OreoCakestir	What a fucking joke Let ’ s hope these idiot never get to work on a project larger than an Android app ever again
LukeKenobie	How to piss off every single person that like dayz Release a status report saying that we have to wait even longer just to get the shit that wa shown back in 2015 helicopter
Pandah Sykes	Ouch Sad day for die hard dayz fan like me that have been here since the beginning When will they learn that they don ’ t need to impress u with early deadline I wouldn ’ t care if the full beta came in 2019 and the full game late 2019 just stop telling u it ’ s “ right around the corner ” because when you actually meet that deadline you always need more time and you always cut feature This is just a sad and disappointing day First it wa the beta that wa going to be half assed now the beta is taking forever to get feature complete and in the near future we have to deal with a long dragged out process of the 1 0 implementation which now we have to wait even longer for the promised content of 1 0 If only they had listened to me and so many other dayz fan to take their time and not rush the console development they screwed themselves using the arma RV engine from the start and we all told them it wouldn ’ t work now we called it again that they would screw up PC development because of the console development
Semirotta	Game still ha a lot to go before it can be called ready though Even the map ha railroad misplaced in many place alone D
jestt600	Dayz devs I can not help thinking what if the money and time you spend on the console version wa used on the PC version It seem like planning and management skill are severely lagging here It feel like the PC community ha been let down here Please get modding sorted out so the community can fix what you can t
jack black	So what I got out of this is the DayZ Mod for ARMA is still better than this
qBMOp	it beta not beeta pronounced baeta
SharpWelder651	Making decision like this is painful for every developer nobody like to see their feature being cut or postponed to some future update but having a balanced and polished core of basic game play is more important than having dozen of flavor supporting and exotic feature SERIOUSLY After 5 long year of patience and 5 000h on the game i wa hoping for more content not le We are not your beta tester we are gamers remember My point of view is valve should force failed early access title developer to refund their customer their money Early access on steam should be like you have 1 2 year to complete the game and make all feature you promised or you have to return all the money and that would make devs think about what theyre promising
winner winner	How many year ha it been Wow fucking terrible progress
Geeky Alex	Just fund scum and abandon this mess
mashguy2	bow how hard is it to make that work
k pham	and 2020
soniferous	year not decade I meant week not month
Aaron Power	Before all of this stuff is brought to the game please fix the water and food stats
The Alchemist	7 00 specifically you re welcome
Frog381	Maybe the dev should release all the game file to the community that way it will actually be finished
lucker5432	people who support this game you have no idea how many people laugh about you histerically the fact that this joke youtuber is reading that shit to you since 1874 show what the community ha become over the past year
Mr Pirate	So basically they ve dropped a pile of promised feature to bring out car and base building Maybe then they wo t lose to scum lol
Jammet Leopard	Thanks so much for the Status Report All the Love to you Septic Falcon D I m feeling a bit down about some detail like Paul doe but hey I ve been playing this for 5 year so I can play more They did write that all weapon type are represented but that isn t the case Neither the Blaze the CRC nor the Winchester are in It wa typically my overwatch position to have one of these I can not even find binoculars now to do something similar And the scope that are currently in the game now aren t close to what that used to be like I also love fishing And my friend and I we need farming vegetable because we enjoy giving away to other player
nonickname100	Basically what I said 3 year ago is happening That the 1 0 will eventually be something like fckin 0 65 or such Also talking that the BETA is mainly for adding content not mechanic climbing obstacle it is not a mechanic Helicopters No bike or bicycle Bows throwable item are not new mechanic Huh Damn you really Devs
Local Yz	I want to see car an being able to make a base on xbox version an pc with making it more stable an add more spot on the map if possible non of that beta junk
P R I E S T	Just let this game die already
CarlJC MJK	They jst took too long to develop dayz sa lot of player moved on based on pure lie from the devs am glad I stopped yr ago playing
DankTube Pooper	Is there literally just one person making this game because it bloody feel that way
Galifré	That pronunciation of beta is horrific
Diamond	So is the map like a button you press in Arma and everyone ha one off spawn or do you have to find one
Idle Navigator	What a painful development process 1 0 with so much missing It ’ s going to feel empty Why not just take a little longer to get that extra content in after all we ’ ve all been waiting year now anyway
Evan Cassell	Seems like good news to me maybe because I wasn t fooling myself in the first place They re focusing on getting some thing done first then go to the other stuff seems like it will get done at the same overall pace just in a different order that honestly make more sense Well that and their definition of what constitutes beta and 1 0 being redefined but really it seems like something to quell the hater by getting the new tech and improvement to stable faster then adding all of the other stuff Doing it in a different order shouldn t really impact the overall timeline Idk maybe I missed something the reason it almost seems good is because if everything from experimental and the latest stress test were optimized and put into stable i have like 6 7 people waiting for my word on when the game will be worth their time because they don t have the patience to put up with glitch crash odd control and all the other thing that come along with it being in Alpha If those thing were stable I d finally feel comfortable telling them that it time that it far enough along that they will have the dayz experience they ve been craving
chance linford	Beeta
Gaijin Senpai	I actually have a CZ 527 and that is a great little light rifle Quick accurate and light I think it s neat that it is coming to a game
Rick Bailey	7 year later
LastNickLeft	We ve invested all time and resource in vehicle But you get no helicopter Bohemia I m very disappointed BI made Arma 3 my favourite game and one of the most complex game I ve ever played BI also can t even say made BI is making the most disappointing game I will not get to play for a while
Bob Star	Bollocks
David Poulton	I ’ d rather just play ARMA3 Exile with Ryan ’ s Zombies Mod on a number of different map Working vehicle Plenty of weapon Base building AI Missions They even have RP server
QAQ QAQ	i have 1035 hour in dayz and sadly dayz is dead
Bob	I wonder septic do you still play Dayz
TicTac	Is there bed to spawn in for thr base
Kamijou Touma	thanks for the info nice video i hope they put back ragdoll on the game cuz i love that feature it made it more realistic and natural
Ashton Horton	Sooooo with vehicle being available are gas station going to have the ability to refuel car or am I gon na have to scrounge and syphon fuel
Jimmy Turner	Damn I remember all xbox player acting like I wa a dick when I said it s never going to get finished
Michael Allen	They ’ re could still be the groza m249 and scout rifle They didn ’ t rule them out
nnekitt98	so this year huh
Clay Nitram	This is like polishing a turd you wind up with a shiny turd
GingerBreadMan	You have what is called a Beta stage for a game and then you have what the Dayz development team call Beta stage for a game Screws up his face I have to say at the beginning of the year 2018 I wa very optimistic for the future of this game and hearing comment like “ beta sooner than you think ” and “ 2018 the year of dayz ” I wa looking forward at what wa coming So I waited and waited and then I waited some more but nothing seemed to be forthcoming My brother predicted this very scenario at the beginning of this year I however wa a little slow I only caught on to it around May I don t know if the dev team is at fault or whether it just might be the engine they are using I mean how hard can it be to put a weapon in the game Everything they need to add just seems to take an absolute age to implement Can the engine really be that bad The comment for this game have always been fairly positive and just this year that position ha been shifting to a more negative stance Most of the comment here are negative but we are still here to comment because we want this game I am just not sure we will get it
MrDirtyDeedz	It s funny people sat there and complained the entire time the game wa being worked on about how long it s taking Now they tell you the beta is coming but you re all still complaining What a toxic community man I tell ya I applaud the people who actually contributed useful information to the feedback tracker Everyone else who did NOTHING useful and just bitched about everything go fuck yourselves Rome wasn t built in a day it take time to create a masterpiece
Pędząca Sałata	Is beta out yet
S C A V B O I	I wonder what the song name he us is Great video a always I always get excited when I see a new video from ya
Łukasz pokoju	To give the illusion they fulfilled their promise to the community about 1 0 deadline devs drastically cut the 1 0 content to be able to release it on time Again workarounds and shenanigan The way they strung the community along multiple time is appalling
Mav"Doc"666	This game is dead
Smail Galijašević	got ta love it D
Cesar4000 PT	Little bit sad but U know it took a lot off time next year will be DAYZ Dayz wemustbelieve
Sparhawk	Tiz for sure disappointing but I ve grown a custom to it magnum ftw great content a usual Mr Falcon keep up the great work looking forward to seeing moooah TTFN 3
Jacktorious	Weeks not month
Jordan Elliott	They literally don t remember the gun so they just put all other weapon in 62 LOL idiot At least look up the gun you implemented into the legacy version AT LEAST
Markillie Manxman/Vorta	have they mentioned farming when can we start growing stuff again
Radek Soci	lol best thing moved to POST 1 0 WHAT A FCK IN SURPRISE RIGHT HAHAHAHAHA we think basebuilding will be enough END GAME WTF Oh I forgot this game is in alpha only 5 year release your broken featureless beta this year everybody knew that it will be thisway anyways useless devs oh and I forgot THIS IS THE YEAR OF DAYZ D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D
Eric Burke	bow completely new what who remembers when they added bow like over two year ago Honestly this game is a fucking train wreck I really hope it is playable within is 0 63 even on stable yet and dont get me started on the fact they released this game FOR MONEY on console before it even ready I love the game but goddamn i hate the people in charge of it
lawAMVs	beetah
Northy Park	As other people say I am not mad but just really dissapointed MODDING really have to save this game for me
Fattest White Guy ever	The only thing I care about is the refund option at 1 0
El Cid	basebuilding when
Andrew Darbey	Sounds like the status report from last year
Erick S	Whatever All the magic will be in Mods
Abdel Malik	Liked the video before i saw it 💪🏽
007alvareichon	http steamcharts com app 221100
Juggernaut9631	bullllllshiiiiiittt 1 0 isnt happening this year there no way youre telling me they will release beta fix the bug AND add all the missing stuff from 62 yeah keep dreaming they have 2 month left to do all of that which includes december and guess what is in december christmas so you can pretty much take away half of december because people will be on holiday 1 5 month to do all of that doesnt sound realistic to me but let keep on waiting better expect worse so you dont get disappointed
ElektroBandit	Just like the TRMZ said old player will come back and see that it ’ s still not where it should be and that might be the last time they try I ’ ve already seen a terrible comment section on PC gamers article
Kai Palfreman	They re bloody rushing it All they need to do is wait until the game is fully compatible with all it proper intended and important feature Instead of rushing this pre 2018 deadline just hold on If they release the game like this it going to flop If they release it how 1 0 wa intended to be released and then put it on a free to play weekend and on a sale on release It would not only bring back old player but also bring new one Then they can start tweaking and adding minor thing and have the modding community help out
Garr3tt	It ha became clear to me that Bohemia Management PR ha ruined this game future slapping 1 0 on anything with le feature than 62 honestly doesn t seem moral I still have faith they are going to at least release the modding tool and then the community will put everything in quicker than the devs ever did
Amperu	Well i guess ill play dayz after 1 0 content update
J.	we ll just have to wait and see how many year have we been waiting and seeing now it s getting really old that sentence Great review a always SepticFalcon
Curtis.E Flush	that s a shame another over promised under delivered target missed i ve tried to remain hopeful ala i m done i ve gone from 12 sub to streamer to 1 remaining the boy that cried wolf spring to mind
bobnab	why did you sound like a retarded robot today wtf love what you do and more peep need to click the like button it not hard is it the tash fucking with the voice lol sort it out before you choke on it
Toxic_Dragon	I d rather have climbing mantling than base building I d rather have vehicle that don t ice skate on dry road than base building I d rather have helicopter than base building SCUM is passing you by DayZ team
Mark Brown	Septic falcon you are one of the only people whose opinion i respect regarding dayz and i would like to see if you agree with me on this point The single biggest mistake the dayZ development team ever made wa not adding a rideable bicycle a a very common item within the first year or 2 of development The reason i say this is because the vast majority of the 40K player that played dayz only played around the coast because it wa simply too time consuming to go to the northern part of the map and if they did they ONLY went to an airfield or high military loot zone effectively making roughly 40 of the map PURE DEAD CONTENT Dead content that make the game harder to run I feel a though the devs were so prideful about their vision for dayz and what it would be in the future that they never bothered to atleast make the CURRENT BUILD OF THE GAME more enjoyable to play there wa very rarely a quality of life change and yes i do understand how game developing work regarding alpha and beta stage but the fact that dayZ s player base wnt from FORTY THOUSAND to eighteen hundred maybe it time to throw the playbook out the window I am 100 CERTAIN that if that simple change wa implemented dayz would have a significant more amount player on daily Sadly enough though it a case of too little too late Not to say Dayz is dead but it certainly will never be the sensation that it wa a damn near social experiment of a game with 40 thousand player They had the chance to be something more and their vision for the future blinded them to the problem of the present I know that s allot of text but if you could give me you honest thought i would really appreciate it i am very passionate about dayz a i ve been playing since the mod wa in it infancy in 2011 it been a big part of my life and i am saddened at the current state of it to say the very least It is nothing like it once wa it a if the game devs are seeking a different audience than the one that gave DAYZ it name
David Herron	I am sorry but i can not empathise with some of these feature trimming what kind of game devs can not change something a simple a door opening both way weird just make modding tool kit and let the fan sort it out
Mr. Valentine	What are you all talking about this is the best update coming out to dayz you all sad
DotaSkilleR	i m not that angry… i just hope we will have a polished dayz standalone 1 0 one day… i dont care if thats sooner or later they are still creating the best survival game out there imo
Joshua Freezen	will definitely miss the helicopter wa always the thing i strived for in dayz mod
MrCabbuge	I want my gun I loved finding all differebt kind of gun ammo and then going to a specific spot and shooting the hell out of them Loved those sound
Barry G	I ’ m going to wait till the asshats get this done
HZ Mike	Well That s the worst status report of all but at least it s honest This time Dev team stopped lying about how they ll finish the game in no time Only good news is they will add some modding tool for u to finish the game ourselves I can t help but feel they will abandon DayZ for good and leave it unfinished and dead just like that
GumGum	LMAO this is a meme now They really started good and now they fucked it up again
Rory Wood	might a well put it back in alpha
mjkulikow	I love DayZ but at this point their result are just laughable I will continue to play a will thousand of others But you can t tell u not to be mad or that this is not a failure Weeks not month 8 month ago FFS door still opening the wrong way
Henry Billing	When the beta is there the game will come for ps4 I watch dayz since 3 Sears in YouTube but i dont habe the money for a gold PC but now it will come for ps4 dream come true😫😫😋✌ PS sorry for my english i am a german guy 😋✊
Ragnarok85	Going into 1 0 with far le content they had year ago Incredible
BlackNeverLeft	Red Dead is out in 2 day 🙂
ZiMRA	lol standalone came out 2013 it 5 year later and nothing to do game is dead
Wunn Sen	Wait so just to clear up they arent adding the Red 9 and the Magnum and such or they are just not yet
Harleyy	they just executed their game lol
Max Pol	I own this game since the very beginning and haven t play it for year but I would be ready to buy it again for the version of our dream
Deadly_M	I hope we eventually get a fix for the magic indoor light that are always turned on in DayZ for example if I go into a shed or bunker and shut the the door I want it to be dark
Aleksa Kovacevic	Geez their status report are so boring and they always dissapoint people
Simon Kraemer	What s the opposite of I am very content with the game it current state and future a well a with the work of the development team and i definitely do not regret having paid actual money for alpha in thinking pause 2012
Andrew Escocia	Septic at this point you are making status report for the dev team not the fan you are the radio DJ in Hitler s bunker one more counter attack and we will push the Russians all the way back to Moscow Games fucked the devs pissed away about 2 year making meat tenderizer and farming and tinkering the map to death but can t find time to get ragdolls i remember being blown away by ragdoll in unreal tournament 2004 and talk about door opening away from you Scum ha this allrdy like it s a Jesus feature that will bring people back to the game
Bud Man	Wow they are so bad
PhishyBongwaters	I don t think anyone wanted a minimalist dayz and that s what 1 0 will be 2 vehicle if they get them working proper stress test seems to indicate we re on step 2 of 18 a literally pitiful assortment of gun absolutely no reason or gameplay loop outside of run to closet mil base get obligatory m4 akm maybe SVD equip obligitory outfight a some of the weight for clothing are clearly made by alien that have never experienced gravity I m sorry but look at lean and jump and tell me that shit is ready Look at the 4x4 nose down into the ground rolling around like a spastic kid on a sugar high Look at the THREE civilian weapon Look at the absolute lack of broken leg Climbing they ve literally already done the mo cap and bone animation for climbing with the zombie like a year ago I love you Septic but I can t find anything positive in this SR other than it doesn t say they ve all quit And I hold zero hope for post release content outside of modding I don t want the basebuilding that s the part of the mod that I hated I could care le about the heli But there are some huge feature gap that take 1 0 back to god I can t even find a build that devoid of feature I actually can t
- DIKKII -	So the only thing making it into beta 1 0 is the Title beta 1 0 lol And not a single mention of what is planned for zombie
Uwanda Roberts	This status report is just depressing The full release will be shit with stuff missing Maybe they should not of been pissing about going to meet and stuff when they have such work to be done Starting to think there all lazy stoner
HeadBob GunPants	I can t believe the negativity here I ve been on the verge of walking away from dayz The new stress test stuff look absolutely awesome
KCT-Ibi	Lol we look forward to any feedback y all dont do shit with our last 5 year of feedback Even this patch isnt What we asked for What a joke and What a shame
Dan Dănuț	i lose faith in this game a long time ago
bws	the reddit page is absolutely blowing up over this
JL Chamberlain	Will there be modding for the Xbox
SpookyPal	I know what would be cool If when a player dy not shot in the head the player becomes a zombie
Haris	5 year to get from alpha to beta 0 year from beta to full release while the game is still broken and content wa postponed
Pascal We	Average player is under 2k this is very very bad
Jiří Dušek	So the whole idea wa that contnent adding will be done before beta and beta will be just bugfixes and now thay posponed content past 1 0 Well correct me if Im wrong but then by definition it is not 1 0 I mean did they just claim they will turn alpha into 1 0 only by naming it 1 0 I guess I should not be suprised Arma 3 also added singleplayer campaign after it release
Mantas Išganaitis	Like if the content gameplay I d say content doesn t have that much gameplay impact comparing to other thing
OSH	Well I predicted this like I predicted that 0 63 experimental will not come out before Q2 that they will release xBox game preview during GamesCom etc They re just behind minimum 2 3 month on their own internal developement plan Disappointed I want my bow
Grumpy_Palpatine	I just want my SKS with PU scope
InfiniteWars	Wait to see they will throw all this shit together and go into beta no matter how good it work or else it next xmas when beta will get released lol
Anej Lasič	Its funny how this devs just dont give a fuck But the hilarious thing is how player stil believe and protect them I have 1200h in dayz wa playing since the mod day I wa here from the release whaiting hoping and everytime they anounced something new to come up i wa hiped but they disapointed me everytime for the last 5 year It wa stil good fun but enuf is enuf Lets just all admit that the Dayz devs are simply unprofesional incompetent careles individual that probably play ping pong all day living off of our money If i became the project manager today this fuck wouldnt be leaving the office till what wa promised had been fixed and released or else they would be fired Simple a that I cant believe a company let their employer be such unprofesional cunt They are shading a bad light on the entire company I wonder why they are not yet fired
Ling Long	I fink it is going to be the best update dayz have ever seen
Sam Fagence	The meta game of Dayz is whether it will actually ever be finished or just abandoned at launch
Zanlam	Looks like we won t be getting bicycle or motorcycle either though
vibrationNC	Further Development 59 month OMFG I know other game dont meet the genre BUT OTHER GAMES are fucking further along MORE FREQUENT UPDATES and PATCHES MORE CONTENT WHAT in the actual fuck are the devs doing ITS NO SECRET I HATE that Hicks loser I personally think he ruined the direction and progress of dayz BUT now he is gone and it like a fucking empty promise every week every update next time next time next time LOOK IT DOESNT MATTER what type of game it is SHooter survival candy crush ITS A FUCKING GAME AND these DEVS HAVE COMPLETELY DROPPED THE BALL YEAH I AM PISSED I have 6300 hour in the game I have spent hour and hour an hour dealing with glitched bug and hacker the lack of loot to too much loot lag privileged streamer only invited to server Hicks himself on the BANHAMMER BUTTON I have every right to be pissed and criticize the game Im not some 200 hour fortnight Johnny little fucker screaming Get Gud Its a JOKE Dayz ha turned into the laughing stock of development ANYWAY I hope they give u a game that is equal and or better than current game But little over 2 month to do so hahahahah NEVER WILL HAPPEN I will say one thing Ive meet a ton of friend awesome people some of the like Mr B Jam Tope and TRMZ plus alot more I will never forget that but IMO Dayz is done it a sinking ship LYLT DAYZ but but but but but but Kinda like the status report never ending but but but but but GG
Brent	if they would stop worrying about adding fucking muchrooms and other shit that noone care about maybe we would have a finished game by now like seriously how can you not have car yet but you have rework all the major cite and airfield and added like 40 plus tree type in the game
Naiden	we talk about week not month
Dallas Van Winkle	omg Are you saying DayZ will not be complete in 2 month Truly shocking No idea how people are surprised or upset about this news
caddi1991	no variety in firearm wow so still boring playing this game and looting WHAT is an AKM now Nothing special you get it
PublicVoodoo	So it now announced that 0 63 is a polished 0 62 but without alot of feature Well im not surprised weve all asked for more item and mechanic over the year and it would be stupid to think the devs would actually deliver I miss my bow
Freddy Löbig	I don t really care for some of the feature that were promised yet won t make it into the 1 0 release But what really really disappoints me is that feature got stripped out that were in before What about horticulture What about dyeing stuff What abut the V3S Those thing were in before I fully understand that those thing need to be re done but wouldn t it do le harm to the game to simply postpone the 1 0 release and get all the feature done instead of simply re defining the content goal I already feel sad for the hard working devs who are definitely going to get a lot of sh t for management decision they aren t responsible for DayZ ha alwas been promised to be an extraordinary survival game That s what kept it alive Releasing the game without core survival feature such a fishing hunting with a bow horticulture etc is a big let down to the loyal community Unfortunately Damage is done there is no going back now I guess
Neck Twister	DayZ is the only game I know that would actually go from 63 to 1 0 with le feature and content I think at this point they just need to let the modding community do what they clearly don t want to do I can t imagine how hard it is to work on a game but I really think this community deserves a hell of a lot more than what we re getting I understand that working on a game is hard but they re pretty much saying fuck it we ll fix it later I really love this game but I really hate that not one damn patch in 4 year ha done anything but make the game look prettier They re making all these map design change that nobody asked for instead of devoting the time and resource to fixing glitch and implementing ALL feature and content from previous patch into the 1 0 It s a shame that one of the best survival game is in charge of such a careless company I expected a lot better from them after what they ve been promising but then again it s the same song and dance for the 5th year in a row
Dajukeboxguy	beta is regarded a a product that s feature complete it s true in a sense that the beta will have all the feature for it s core gameplay to work OMEGALUL fancy way of saying it s good enough and we can t do more lul
Sappy-Seaman	There is no guarantee that any of the content they promise will be delivered after 1 0 It ha been too long
White Folk	So when will the “ Full ” game be released for console
Toves Plays	No bow and no fishing Disappointing shift away from survival
Oscar Muffin	I started playing Dayz after it wa released about 200 hour and a few week later I dropped it because there wasn t really much to do A few year later after seeing everyone raving about how 0 63 is going to revive the game I decided to give it another go yesterday To be quite honest apart from looking a bit better and not having massive lag spike desync terrible fps not a whole lot ha changed You re still running around starving to death and finding a pathetic amount of loot But now there is nothing to use your gun on because in two day I have not seen another player at all
Stanco187er	JUST GIVE ME ALL THE GUNS FROM 62 FOR FUCK SAKE DEVS
Aussie Cleetus	If they re not broken they need to just release the tool asap The community will make the content they failed to provide and save them month of work
Tom Cripple	Postponed content Isn t that like the entire DayZ Experience
MitchieBTW	I hope we will be able to steer the vehicle with the mouse like we could in every arma game
Yolo Mach ich auch immer	This vid sound like x file
Joey	I really miss 4 year ago I wa a high school freshman only playing with online friend bc like no one I knew had a PC I would wait every 2 week to see the status report review you would do and I d walk home so fucking fast just to play dayz
Alex Ander	Its amazing how they will deliver the game finished by 2020 I solidly believe that They needed 5 month only to implement car Now 6 month for helis and 6 more for climbing and meanwhile general polishing of the server client comm This is a huge dissapointment for u all And we all wait to play it once when it done The most delayed game of the century
Caiden Green	What about Xbox anyway I just subscribed I saw this video and thought that this is going to be a good way to stay up to date so I can t wait till the next video keep doing a good job😁
eccoJAM	Are you paid to promote this game Serious question
LORD Lordy	PS4 when
Roy Moreland	After 6 year this game will finish with le than it started with I don t expect to ever see those postponed feature They ll drop what they ll call 1 0 and that will be it I can t see them suddenly turning out quick and efficient update AFTER 1 0 when they were never able to do so BEFORE With H1Z1 shutting down tomorrow I can t help but pick up a similar odor here I m not saying that they re driving nail in the coffin yet but it sound like they re lookin for a hammer
Johnny369	We just need stable 1 0 and modding tool Mods will make this game great like they used to do with arma 2
TheVibeMagician	even a 1080 ti will lag with this game i find this game unplayable did the devs ever play the mod look like this game ha been made for 5 year old
Björn Dahlberg	Is it just me that yell TRAITOR when killing zombie Dean xD
DuhOneZ	Whoa that wa a lot to take in No helis that s alright will make more meme mod while we wait P
Jacob Lahaie	What about farming
Austin Youngerman	SAY IT DAYZ IS DEAD
KRJ _Drama	Electricity system on base building whaat Bro This is so interesting
Nathanielk 04	Can ’ t wait for helicopter
Dillywang Onions	Beta is cancer
BigDawg Cleveland	Will we be able to use the new Cherno map in Arma 3 Thanks for the update brother Falcon
Chyle Vance	Rag doll
xCLARKxKENTx	dayz probably will not be a popular a it wa when it originally released i think peaking at around 45 thousand unique player online at any given time but i have hope that it can be a game that i can be happy to put another 2000 hour into i miss dayz and have recently started playing again and even tho it only in experimental 63 it ha brought life back into this game for me hope to see all from 500 meter through my sniper scope happy looting all P
Jack Severity	What ha the gaming world come to how can they release it a 1 0 and think it ok with so much stuff out of the game This wa the ONE last chance Dayz ha at bringing people back Im sure there will be many people come back and try the game again and im sure we are going to see youtube full of Dayz 1 0 LOLZ there wa so much more in the game in 62 LEAVE 1 0 until everything most thing are back in the game It feel so rushed or forced and who say after 1 0 hit how much more content we are going to get We can all sit back and say Modders are going to save the game which they probably will but we didn t pay modders for the game Its the Devs job to get this game back to the glory it once wa not modders Please Dayz don t release 1 0 until 99 of the feature are back in the game Its your last chance to bring back people when 1 0 launch
tee mu	So when all of this is coming
Furoki	I feel like time spent developing doesn t necessarily translate to better quality with dayz devs They just slow in general
HORSEDICKoMPEG	the new engine wa Going to make new content and thing faster and more streamline it like the engine is built to work literally against them release the modding tool so the game can become the game it could be for free at the hand of people who will work on it a a hobby and surpass the actual dev team who JOB it is to Dev a game but cant
Oxford Trenter	The Vehicles need more weight
satan spawn	So when will an actual update release
mathskzha	they can t do genades or bow Also fishing better be something more substantial than a text minigame if they can t do that
Dwayne P	In the future we will be saying ” And it wa at this point Scum took over survival genre ”
DreamZL1	Let s keep in mind they said all of this will be in the 1 0 release that will be out THIS YEAR Getting to that milestone is huge and after 5 year I can wait a few more month for the thing they left out to be perfected The current physic of vehicle are so bad I d hate to try flying a helicopter anyway 2019 look quite promising for everyone in the Dayz community both vanilla and moded flavor
Mykeyboy	Can t climb over obstacle ok but remove The Infected climbing over wall Right Love your vid s Septic been away for work and cant wait to see more stream
BudVision	postponed content What else is new sigh wa really looking forward to using the heli to deliver christmas present to all the good little Chernarus boy and girl look s like Santa s takin the V3S this year
System Of A FoX	So we are still getting the missing feature and content later in the future after 1 0
Romanes Eunt Domus	I think they covered the most important feature to make it a fresh experience and spend some hour in DayZ again I dont care what they call this update and all I hear is that Im going to get car and base building THIS YEAR The best day I ever had in DayZ were back in Origins mod on a private Server with about 20 to 30 people playing regularly divided in probably about 5 team across the map And i think the SA is now way better than Origins mod ever wa and is only missing something to do besides gearing up and getting shot I get why u guy are making those long face but im still thrilled about this next big update Im a glass half full guy and I spend about 900 hour in a 25 buck game I saw some base on reddit and I really want to build something like that with a couple of friend
Пенсионер	Нихуя не понял но очень интересно
HaloMC1171	The little devs that couldn ’ t
Squimp	This cookie ha fallen apart in some expired milk
DrJosh	Bows are more important then helicopter
Zero	Wow who would have thought that they wouldn t deliver like they promised Again
SuperTyrannical1	They should add roaming ai who ko like some of the mod And mission like downed helis with a lot of loot guarded by the military clean up crew
IsleofMAN	Bita Op
Joseph Edwards	Problem with a polished turd is it is still a turd Yes they will make it into 1 0 finally Well let just say it this way they keep taking stuff out now they want the modders to finish the product they failed to fulfill their promise End of the game a polished turd still a stinky turd They really dropped the ball hard to say you have proper working feature of a game when you are not releasing the game you promised
OMEGAthinker	JUST LET MODDERS DO ALL THIS FOR YOU
Heruzu	Namalsk anyone ￣ρ￣
Official NoWorries	Luckily modders will have the game finished within 6 month of 1 0 dropping
Sunny_Rayz	I just want more pve stuff to do gathering and hunting can only take me so far
Marcus Elgart	Probably the most depressing status report in a long time They really let this game hype die so many time It ll still be a good game by next November with gamebreaking bug still and the hype will be completely gone to other game Why cant devs admit they didn t do it They failed to deliver actual beta in 6 year of alpha I know im a negative cunt Dont expect my gripe to be the last or the ugliest at all I ll be back when it actually beta Long from now
Side Quest NPC	Dayz postponed Well now I ’ ve heard it all
MinersLoveGames	Modding will pick up the slack
Jack T	They re excluding all of the fun and personally cooler gun and bow on the launch they need to be quick cause fuck everything not making it is the shit that make the game enjoyable
BBk	Omg dayzzz fokiiin good
DISWAYonDISPLAY	love your breakdown of the report pal keep um up
Connor Thompson	Are they joking about all the gun
CartoonrBOY	I must be tough a the developer maintaining momentum amongst so much negativity Keep at it guy It will be great when it is finished
Mike de bakker	let s just hope that a soon a the beta hit stable there will immediately be rapid fire content update to get all the stuff back from 0 62
Philip Jensen	oh boy didnt see that one coming classic dayz
Joe Morales	Am I the only one that think the devs need to just give u more mod tool and finish all the shit in the stress test and just leave Let u finish the game because we ’ re the only one that care
Kevin Staley	I actually feel sorry for the dev team Its embarrassing
Antykain	Even with some of the high wanted content and feature being postponed I personally will think that the wait will be worth it Soon enough the DayZ community will have the game we have all been waiting for One of the big thing I am really looking forward to is seeing what the modding community will bring to the table for u in DayZ The current mod that are available are just the beginning a lil taste of what s to come later down the road A road that I am going to continue traveling down SepticFalcon Hope you get to feeling better bud Awesome job on the Status Report a usual
DerekSniper30	Beta I m sure if it s a EU thing to say B ee ta but for the rest of the world it s pronounced B ay ta
wonderland78	we ve arrived at a decision that you ll have enough fun without helicopter Fools Now go and play your end goal le game
Biddaman85	Oh well I m still having so much fun with what we have now So I m at least thankful we have what we do and not getting this news while still on 0 62 But still I miss my SKS I think I want helicopter but that is just a machine that let s everyone know where you are I would rather run and be unseen than fly and be out on display
Top Secret	dayz is still dead
Basil 2.0	beeeta update
james bryant	Literally nothing happening for console release this patch I guess this is a big drop for pc so they want to make sure it work but we could really do with a day night cycle sometime soon
JoeyShitHead	So in short we re continuing on working on the core game play function like we have been for the last 5 year
declan long	TBH Falcon I m just happy we are getting close to release I am one of those people that played the game back in DAYZ Mod when it first came out and seen the potential I am a Core Arma player heart and that s my background and If I am honest I stopped playing DAYZ about a year and a half ago to let it develop however I have always keep up to date with Videos from you and other guy Once the Beta go to stable I ll be back Enjoying your content keep it up dude declan long Wolfhound
Captain_Bigzy	Dont care too much for helicopter right away a they are very much an end game thing but I wa hoping by beta we would see more than just an offroad and a V3S wheres bike and atv s As for the rest they need to get fishing and bow in fast IMO None the le looking forward to Beta and to see how the future of DayZ pan out
Hobo	Same shit different year good job septic keep up the good work a always
Dustin Blane	So is it updated or not

LastMan	I love DayZ and love these Status Report Highlights but the feeling of disappointment is clear for all I ll wait just like all the veteran and let hope the light at the end ha been worth the wait
Ironside32	I m not angry I m just disappointed
ShamSharks	At the very least I believe it is reasonable to implement the item that were in 0 62 for the 1 0 patch This includes all the weapon we previously had and all the vehicle we previous had Its a bit of a let down but a long a we EVENTUALLY get all of the feature it will be fine
h0llow	In short We don t know how to do Ragdoll Helicopters Throwing Guns Srsly and etc but we will try Very optimistic report for a game that lost 90 of it s audience They didn t even teased u with new stuff didn t even showed gifs video from internal testing they didn t even tried to make this report at least somewhat positive
Flex	I dot usually comment on video but you give me hope for DayZ with constant content on the new update for me without having to do my own research so thank you
ThePope OfAwesomeness	But but but I want to crash and kill my friend with my horrible flying skill
