Demonic Queen	I Don't Think Team Neo Plasma Are Suppose To Be Pirates,Though. They Look Like Some Kind Of Black Ops.
Brisingr Phoenix	3:53 plasma has more visual relations to a crusader, which would actually make a lot of sense since their ideology seems more in line with fulfilling some sort of "holy" quest
Fluffel	Isn't (4:12) she from the other Pokemon manga?
pokemon gamer	No it csnt be dawn is good
Justin Roxx	Blue uh I mean, Dickass was rumored to be in Team Rocket
Cookie__XD	The last one is a little far fetched...  Still very nice Video!
YaBoiCYT!!	Bonus fact : Giratina is Gas (ghost type) Palkia is liquid (water type) and dialga is solid (steel type) and team plasma is the fourth state of matter  (plasma :D )
Jeffrey Howard	Just realized you uploaded this on my birthday! This is Jeff from IG! üòå
Real_SuperPig	I once read a comment that said mars' hair style resembles a roman helmet, and mars is also the roman god of war.
TKnHappyNess	The only Team Galactic Commander that was/wasn't named after a planet is Charon. He's named Pluto in Japan and in some other countries
Ghost Blade	Archie: I‚Äôll end this now Maxie  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  *hair turns good pod and grows out*  Tabitha: MAXIE what does the scouter say about his Poke-level?   Maxie: It‚Äôs OVER 9000!!!!!  Courtney: What....... 9000? Can‚Äôt be true....... that‚Äôs impossible!  Archie: people of Earth! LEND ME YOUR OCEANS!
Angelberg Chua	Maybe team galactic is former team magma
VyrusHost Cat	"Hi I'm named after chocolate." -Mars
Lanette Lassiter	Wow very interesting video
theurbanshark	"Fri-Gate" it's not pronounced like that.
Tony Tang	Did you know that the Team Flare Scientist's names actually have a clever origin: Their initials are A, B, C, M and X, which are actually the levels of solar flares, A being the weakest and X being the strongest. The order you fight them in is also from the weakest to the strongest.
Erasmus1712	Great video! I love how you connect all the dots because this seems to make sense! :)
Nerdtendo	I think Mars's skirt looks more like a UFO rather than the ring of a planet.
Travis letchford	I just started my first diamond play though after playing platinum several times
Jean Paul Martin	Fun fact: Mars in Spanish is ‚ÄúMarte‚Äù, this is the Spanish name for the planet. The day of the week (Tuesday) is called in Spanish ‚ÄúMartes‚Äù.
Slater Racz	#LetsGoN!
Sharpedeo's Minecraft	Plz odd facts on team galactic.  Plz
RedRescueTotodile	I swear Team Plasma was made specifically to mock PETA. They want you to think they're good people who really care about Pokemon/animals, but then you learn they're crazy extremists who ignore things like facts (Pokemon like being with their trainers, pets are happy with their owns) and the well-being of the Pokemon/animals they claim to care about in order to push their full liberation agenda.
Jill Sandwich	Mars' hoop could easily be the asteroid belt, dude.
James Lysakowski	hey my dude! the plasma-pirate connection is actually deeper than you may think! the staff that Ghetsis holds is actually VERY similar to the symbol known as the Chi-Rho, which was a symbol historically used by soldiers of the Crusades as it symbolized the greek name for Christ, an interesting fact on its own, as the grunts are dressed in medieval styled armors, Ghetsis wears ornate robes like the Pope and they have a much more "religious" feel to their goals, even lifting N up as a potential "savior". this is not where it ends, it is commonly thought that many of the soldiers after the Crusades took to the sea, becoming pirates, and throughout, when one was killed, their skulls and bones arranged similarly to the Chi-Rho to send a message, thus when they became pirates, they adopted this morbid signal as the death of the Crusaders, becoming the Jolly Roger. Pokemon gets straight deep.
Drahjan MasterOfBoundaries	So many timelines!! Why is there a evil Dawn?!
Blazingredfire13	Damn got clickbaited.
Silly Wobbuffet	"Because all of the oddest things in the Pokemon world seem to happen in the manga" This is why we need a 10 odds fact about the manga!
Sophie Cooke	In the dark ages, plasma was part of what was known as the four humours.
Pika-Mickey-Chu	Uploaded On My 32nd Birthday!
R H	I actually thought Mars‚Äô dress looks like a UFO.   Ans Mitsumi is a different character altogether. I guess Dawn‚Äôs role in the games depends on who you play as. If you play as Dawn, Lucas is the assistant to Prof. Rowan, lol. So I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs her role in the games, since it‚Äôs interchangeable with Lucas‚Äô (and since I‚Äôve always played as Hikari, Lucas to me is the helpless assistant lol.)   But anyway, Mitsumi has a way different backstory than Hikari. The only thing they have in common is the outfit.
Aidan Or	4:06 I thought Oddish were in the games and anime too.
Thi-Antra Chirasarn	You got the fact about the Punk Guys and Girls in Alola a tiny bit wrong. They either have nothing to do with Team Skull or are once members of Team Skull and left.
Shadow Kodo	Theres A Place In The Volcanion Movie Called The AZOTH Kingdom
Extra Thicc	Ok, that final fact was forshadowing.
Bendict Bash	martes is also Tuesday in Fillipino
Iman Kaba≈°	This video deserves more likes
Gryffynbyrd	Also Wanted To Mention That Team Plasma Is Also A Reference To How Zekrom Is Electric Dragon Type And Reshiram Is Fire Dragon. Also Plasma Is If I Remember Correctly Fire And Electricy Fused
G 92	Schemmel also voiced Cyrus in the Diamond&Pearl series which I think may have influenced his portrayal of Goku Black, to some extent at least
Michael Klump	Wait... Pokemon Black and White came out in 2011, only seven years ago. That would make you only 21 years old. Damn you're young! I'm like, 30!
Justin Jones	Mitsumi was really cool I like to think of her as a grown up Dawn in the future. wish we got  to see  the protagonist all grown up.
Juniper Storm	Awesome video! I love all of these facts!
Camo 64	I have a suggestion: 10 odd facts about Starters
Kendrico E. Stubbs	Lol @ whomever named their Sewaddle ‚ÄúSpankwire‚Äù üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Kevin Cruz	"Pirates are seen as bad people" Dude piracy is a crime.
Fire Fox	I keep seeing the Zelda GBC in your shelves.
Gabe The blade	Do 10 facts about the manga!
The Sucker	how do u know meltan is based off mercury and not cesium or gallium? Mercury is toxic and very dangerous but meltan shows no such characteristics
rasiu uchiha	this is a great facts video.
Ken Lemer	Team Plasma we take your Pokemon and use them for bad doings
crypto dash warlock	Great video hoopsandhiphop, keep it up brother.
Pokemon Joker	Wow those facts were actually mind blowing ü§Øü§Ø! Loved the video as always !!!
Janel Hartman	In the sprites team plasma might look like pirates but in the official art works they look more like mercenaries.
DJ Tile Turnip	Tuesday      Doomsday
SwitzBound	I think AZOTH could also have something to do with AZ because he built the Ultimate Weapon which can pretty much destroy everything. Also, whoever noticed the Team Flare vs Team Rocket thing probably has WAY too much free time on their hands.
Omar Jobe	You should do the theory that Cyrus created ultra space
The Ahdurin Region	Speak for yourself, Tuesday is literally just another Monday after the original, but you're still so far from the end of the week. At least on Monday you can remember the good old weekend; by Tuesday you've forgotten
Storm Aurora	There are tons of weird/interesting things to be found in Pok√©mon manga. I'd suggest you do a 10 odd facts video on Pok√©mon manga, except you'd be limiting yourself way too much by doing only 10 facts...there have been _so_ many manga adaptations over the years, you could practically dedicate a whole video just to naming all of them XD
Darkrai Nightmare	since I'm currently reading the Diamond & Pearl Adventures manga, I'm honestly surprised you didn't include the apparent hive mind of most of Team Galactic, i.e all of the grunts except for one
PokeGens Player	1. dawn looks sexy in the manga 2. i like purple
Colin Hawks	I wish anime Team Flare was the Team Flare that we got in the games...shit got REAL in the anime and my god why didn‚Äôt they act like that in the game >:(
TwitchyWitchX	so who confirmed the punk/skull "fact"  i didnt see any confirmation
Chipsnsalsa ftw	Mitsumi isn't from adventures. She's from a completely different manga, which was not written by Satoshi and Hidenori. I don't remember who wrote it, but it was not adventures. I read it, and it was okay, but it definitely wasn't illustrated by the same person. You can tell by the way the uh... cleavage... sticks out.
Bulba Paul	Awesome facts :D  As soon as I heard Archie I knew straight away it was Goku haha such a recognisable voice.
Caitlin Marshall	Meltan isn‚Äôt confirmed for let‚Äôs go
DuskCynderMaya	When you already read the manga and knew a high amount of these facts about Dawn's cool backstory.    *sips tea* Noice.  This was a joke but I do recommend the manga for any Pokemon fan; great video Hoops and nice facts.
Kitty Potato	Yeey you are the best poke tuber ive ever seen, it's amazing that you take your time for videos! THANKS A LOT‚ù§
Szymon Z≈Çociak	What have team rocket with rockets?
BatvViki	Ice pun!
Bryce Mckenzie	Team Rocket Rocks It! Talking Trouble, Double Trouble!
H8 Sonneillon	I thought Mars dress looked like a UFO.
Samuel Stannard	I'm really enjoying this series, each episode is so interesting. Can't wait for the next instalment!
Thanongrit Suriyarungka	Gen 5 is underrated and all the hate for bad design is all hype or bandwagon hate way exaggerated hating on gen 5 pokedex  Gen 5 had great new pokemon in a huge total amount  Bisharp zebritzka eletkross tynamo rogerrolla line (great shiny) the crocodile haxorous hydragon (is the closet thing to yu gi oh fusions monsters three headed dragons like ultimate blues eyes white dragon or cyber dragons ) meloetta swords of justice the tao dragons with white black kyurem being the first real pokemon fusion! Genesect zoroark  braviary volcarona drappion centipede
Xanakin Sceptre	Odd fact about me - I can't miss even one of your video
Dean David	Good Stuff Hoops!  Gotta say tho, just the fact that team rocket has it's own video kinda proves the point that generation 1 isn't underrated :p
This Guy!!!	Hey today is Tuesday and I‚Äôm a little scared
firepiplup	But team plasma in b2w2 were also ninjas
BB Mc's World!	Great video I thought I was the only one who noticed that the team skull grunts look similar to the punks from X and Y
UnovaKid 24	Have you ever done 10 odd facts about each of the regions themselves? I'd love to see that kind of video!
Catriam Flockentanz	3:43 Doesn't that also makes a lot of sense given that Team Plasma somewhat breaks apart into the "positive N-Branch" and the "negative Ghetis-Branch" during the story gap inbetween B/W and B2/W2?
Z A N E	10 Oddsome facts
YouDontSay Jon	You forgot to do a fact about team Magma specifically
Eileen Keller	üí¢ Mars in mythology is the Roman equivalent/counterpart of Ares. As in, the Greek god of war. üí¢ Jupiter (in Roman mythology) is also the son of Saturn and the father of Mars. üí¢ Saturn's hair may be a corruption of the astronomical symbol for his planet.  üí¢ On the technicality that Charon's Japanese name is Pluto, Cyrus is the only known member of Team Galactic not to share his name with a planet.
Henrique von B√ºren	Eh the Flare and Rocket comparison was really interesting!
Champion DarkBlaze!	That final fact tho.ü§ØüòØ
Pok√® Kid	Ayyyy new Video. Lit my dude.
smb85 dkc94	What if Gen 2 was a soft-reboot instead of a direct sequel to Gen 1? And if Johto was based on only the Kansai Region of Japan while make it as big as Gen 1's Kanto? And Johto having its own regional Evil Team with a female crime boss, regional Pokedex of 150 Pokemon(105 new ones(all new, with fewer evolutions of older Pokemon) and 45 old ones, new Johto Fossil Pokemon, and several of the 45 old Mons had Johto variants like the Alolan Forms), if Johto had its own regional Pokemon League and its own Elite Four members?
Galaxy-Eyes Garchomp	Team Plasma is my favorite evil team. However, I‚Äôm not a fan of neo team plasma.
Andres Marrero	"It all comes together."  Courtesy of Lockstin.
Dashfan 05	This series just keeps on getting better and better! Part of me wants to catch a Xatu so I can see what's coming next! Because the human-pokemon language barrier wouldn't be an issue...
Yair elam with silvally, garchomp and lucario	6:52 HHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYY CCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAPPPPPPPP MIND. FRICKED.
Orilyn Sahu	Enjoyed the video a lot as usual. The team Plasma fact was great. Never thought of it that way. Also that last Meltan fact was just awesome ... Keep the good work going.  Best wishes from India üòÑüòÑüòä
Tigger The Incineroar	Team Skull and The Aether foundation are my favourite evil teams. Also I love how you tie in meltan into everything as it makes me like meltan more! Great video btw
Kenji87	"Just like how Dawn is in the games." Well that's odd, I'm pretty sure I play her, and the professor's assistant is a boy named Lucas :D
Violet Fox	Awesome video about the evil teams Hoops and Hip-hop.  I hope when gen 8 comes in the anime, that your theory like you mentioned in this video that team aqua and magma have something to with meltan's existence will come true, then all the evil teams come together to cause massive destruction, thus altering the space time continuum. Ash then has a rebirth he meets Brock and Misty again....
Grant Daily	Wait! So instead of a small reboot like Black/White we're going to get another set of time lines? Where it stands, theoretically, the timeline/multiverse is already big  Line/verse one Red/Blue/Green - Gold/Silver/Crystal  Line/verse two Leaf Green/Fire Red - HG/SS- Emerald/Ruby/ Sapphire - D/P/P- Black/White - B2/W2  Line/Verse 3 X/Y - S/M  Line/Verse 4 X/Y - US/UM  Theoretically this üëÜ is how the time lines/Multiverse goes
WaterJinx	Actually, the association between Mars and Tuesday isn't coincidental.  In Germanic and Romance languages, many days of the week are tied to the names of deities and astral bodies.  Sun-day,  Monday [moon day], Tues-day [tyr/tiu's day] in English and Martedi [Mars day] in Italian, Wednesday [(W)odin's day] in English and Mercoledi [Mercury day] in Italian, Thursday [Thor's day] in English and Giovedi [Jupiter day] in Italian, Friday [Freyr/Freya/ or Frigg's day] in English and Venerdi [Venus day] in Italian, and finally Saturday [Saturn's day]
Guy with no subscribers	I like team aqua/magma
Otter Insanity	Her name is Tuesday because in most European languages, many days of the week are named after gods or celestial bodies. Sunday/Monday are the sun(day) and moon(day), Tuesday is war after Tyr(sday) (Nordic god of War) Wednesday is Odin/Woden(sday), Thursday is Thor(sday), Friday is Freya(day), and Saturday is Saturn(day).
TheNorth15	Don't know about you but I think Pokemon Adventures Team Galactic is the best Team Galactic. Adventures Cyrus is the most intimidating take on Cyrus of the Diamond and Pearl games and how he progresses as a character will BLOW. YOUR. MIND.
Jadeazora	Plasma and Galactic are my favorite villain teams. Plasma just has a cool bunch of characters in terms of leadership (I mean, take your pick with the fangirl bait with a sad backstory, the psychopathic sadist who hits new levels of evil every time we see him, from child abuse to outright attempted murder, and the affable scientist who plays both sides and happily admits to despising his boss) and Galactic in terms of a rather interesting goal (And Cyrus for his backstory. He's actually pretty pitiable.)
Lucas _	Roses are red im 15 minutes late motu patlu is the best anime
Ryu Majin	That last one felt a little Reachy but it was a really good video none the less
Gojifan02 BR HD	wait,archie is 175 cm,holy miltanks,i was the only here who think that he was taller?
Shy Tenda	Wait... Team Galactic was supposed to be intimidating ? With these haircuts ?
Will Kibbel	"Tremble in fear, for it is I, Tuesday!!! Mwahahaha!!!"
Ëä±Èõ™	Lake of Rage is in Johto, not Kanto.
Gregg Burner	Love the Videos Hoop! Keep em coming for a while. You rock dude
Phoenix Wright	Team Skull best team cause they represent the Raiders
Storm Lindsen	CLICKBAIT BUT I DON'T MIND
Quisle Pixel	TEAM PLASMA IS THE BEST EVIL TEAM!!
KernowShinigamiViper Lil'Dragon	Be back later. Always in lectures when these videos drop but as great as they are university comes first.
