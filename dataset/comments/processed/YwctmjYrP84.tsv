Jadeazora	Plasma and Galactic are my favorite villain team Plasma just ha a cool bunch of character in term of leadership I mean take your pick with the fangirl bait with a sad backstory the psychopathic sadist who hit new level of evil every time we see him from child abuse to outright attempted murder and the affable scientist who play both side and happily admits to despising his bos and Galactic in term of a rather interesting goal And Cyrus for his backstory He s actually pretty pitiable
