FLotorious	Hey Hector I ‚Äô m sure you probably won ‚Äô t see this but I don ‚Äô t use any social medium so this is the only place I have to say it and I have to say it You and your channel have done so much for me you have no idea I am a single father of two girl So the beginning of this particular video really got me choked up and decided that now wa the time to finally say something I started off following OpTic in Bo1 and wa determined to grind my way on to the pro team and or become a content creator until later that year when we found out that I wa going to be a father It changed everything I wa 17 and so scared I had to cut back playing almost completely but I watched every event that year Amazing thinking back on the time when MLG CoD really started to Blume Mw3 wa such a big year for OpTic specially OpTic CoD and honestly all of the stream got me through that first year of being a father much easier I could go in depth year by year and tell you about how much each year change moment got me through all of my ups and down but I know how busy you are so I ‚Äô ll try to keep it short Fast forward to 2018 I have my 8 year old queen and another 2 year old princess Unfortunately we lost their mother during the birth of my youngest It wa the absolute hardest thing I ‚Äô ve ever had to deal with and 2 year later it still feel like it isn ‚Äô t real I want you to know how much your Vlogs video and now the Eavesdrop ha gotten me through the most difficult time of my life You don ‚Äô t know how much you truly have helped me stay on track through inspiration and motivation to be a better man Watching you move through life and day to day situation no matter how good or bad the way that you do honesty ha taught me so much Seeing the amazing father you are and that you manage to be even with the insanely busy life career you have is incredible You have never changed since day 1 You are literally one of the only thing in my life that hasn ‚Äô t changed on me I ‚Äô m not sure you know how much that mean to someone like me Sometimes you just need something familiar to hold on to Over the year dedicating myself to being the absolute best father and man that I can possibly be I haven ‚Äô t had the time or the fund to game record stream the way that I would have liked to But I will some day and you give me hope that I will accomplish that goal I Haven ‚Äô t had the chance to see the CoD team compete in person But I will some day and you give me hope that I will accomplish that goal Some day I ‚Äô m going to meet you shake your hand look you in the eye and say thank you At the end of the day I want you to know that if nothing else you changed my life and indirectly changed the life of two little girl You are a huge part of the reason that I am the man that I am Never change brother I don ‚Äô t have the money these day to really support the stream or buy any of the merch but AS SOON a I do you know I am building my self a man cave and filling that bish up with OpTic everything Can ‚Äô t wait to send you a pic of that someday But no matter how much OG stuff I buy I will NEVER be able to repay you and all that you have done for me I ‚Äô m going to stop rambling now and I apologize for the horrible writing Doubt you ‚Äô ll ever see this but if you do just know that you will forever have a fan and a supporter in me Thank you SO MUCH HECTOR All the love in the world from my little family my brother ü§ôüèª

Rick Rackow	a secretary personal assistant ha multiple purpose but to be honest first and foremost it allows you more time for people your team le time on outlook excel and word you still make the decision when it matter and a personal assistant is a person of trust so they are hard to hire but therefore have a good understanding of what you think I still would recommend to get one at a certain point and my opinion from a distance is that you ‚Äô re past this point but i guess you ‚Äô re a bit of a control freak still think about it just saying
