CrashSable	It s the argument against excuse 3 that piss me off If a person truly belief their vote is inconsequential you are not going to persuade otherwise them by just saying yes it doe matter Or if you do try to present an argument for WHY their vote matter you just roll out the same tired old platitude that they have heard a thousand time before and already dismissed It doesn t matter if you think they are stupid for doing so or if you think they should have been persuaded by your argument the fact of the matter is they haven t and they won t be until you have a real conversation with them and PERSUADE them rather than trying to bully them Equally this always go hand in hand with this idea that people seem to have that of the people who don t vote they have all somehow reached a consensus that they would all vote for your candidate if they were bothered but have decided to let the other guy win out of apathy which is of course delusional and incredibly arrogant

Sigurd Jensen	Winner take all system discourages voting get rid of voting circle How s about a percentage based system instead eh So we can get a bunch of different view in more frequently Vote blank if you don t like any of the candidate Tactical voting doesn t show your actual interest Not voting and voting on noone is completely different because it s easier to see a blank vote a a statement that noone in your area is doing what you want done I believe a a non american that most american were fairly indifferent on yesteryear presidential nominee Imagine if only a handful of voter actually voted and the rest turned in blank vote It may not have changed anything but Trump might ve instead won with le than 10 of the vote between 2 nominee Imagine what sort of message that sends Vote for noone It s better than not voting

Imani Malaika	Voting is important Even more important is holding elected official accountable on issue that affect your daily life Politicians who do not respond to the need and voice of their constituent in the general populace amount to taxation with representation Identity politics is NOT the same a representation For too long politician who look like u continually fail to represent our economic interest WE MUST NO LONGER give politician an excuse to not know what we want We must REPEATED AND EMPHATICALLY tell them and demand they respond instead of them telling u what is important Once elected a politician govern ALL citizen Not everyone vote in every election or ballot measure but every single one of u get taxed even on a pack of gum Most politician choose issue that either are designed to be emotional trigger just to garner the most vote or that actually deflect from critical health economic and privacy need of the citizen majority Big money donor and corporate entity have an inordinate influence on public policy If money is considered to be speech then constituent voice must have equal weight Politicians must take into account life changing legislative outcome and how people will affected by them Citizens should have ready access to pending legislation and it relevant outcome Established legislation should be publicly cataloged on the basis of impact to constituent group and updated in real time Citizens are responsible for letting their voice be heard and have the right to responsive governance

Liberal Larry	Are we going to vote for the same policy that gave u Trump If that s what we want we should vote for Joe Biden Corey Booker and any establishment Democrat that take big corporate donation and supported Hillary Clinton when it wa Clinton VS Sanders If we want to vote for a TRUE people s champion not just one who pretend to be one when he s campaigning like Trump then we need to vote for someone who doesn t take corporate money Their is one person who fit this criterion and that is Bernie Sanders The most popular politician in the country according to polling who painfully obviously is fighting the hardest for the middle class against the powerful when needed BY FAR If you think he s too old to do the job 1 Biden is the same age 2 What doe the job require Youth and good posture or an uncorrupted person who doesn t take corporate money ha a good understanding of what ordinary people need and ha shown they re willing to stand up for ordinary people against the powerful Was Biden or Obama calling for Wall Street banker who caused the recession to face justice No Could it be they didn t because they took money from them Yes Corporate campaign donation are unfortunately legal and unlimited Open Secrets track them

Spicy Leprechaun Stuff	Bastard
Burn :D	God He is sooooo lovely fucken hell
Aaron Muck	Listen I think Barack is a cool guy I personally didn t like what he did in office but he s funny a shit and a pretty upstanding guy but I have to disagree with this video Me personally I have plenty of reason not to vote although I m sure most of them only apply to Presidential Elections I still choose not to get involved A few reason on why I choose to not vote 1 Me personally I prefer to be a centralist and it s not because I can t pick a side but it s because I don t like the fact that we only get two choice Republican or Democrat there s no middle ground when voting you re either pro gun or anti gun pro abortion or anti abortion you re not allowed to find a middle ground because the people we vote for do not stand in the middle ground it s always one or the other 2 The State that I live in determines whether or not I have a chance at voting for who I want and not what the State want When you vote you re actually voting for who you want to vote for the President And most would think that the person you vote to vote for whoever you want would HAVE to vote for who you want to be the President but that s no the case in 24 States including the one I m living in they can vote for whoever they want And since I m more of a centralist if I were to vote for someone who go against my State s view Being that we re a Red State then there s a very small chance that my vote would ever matter 3 In a perfect world I see people voting for who they think will do best in office not someone who s within the same political party they attend in which mean that I would prefer to vote for Independents rather than Republicans or Democrats since I see them a people who care more about fact rather than sticking to one side so hard that you d need a scalpel to scrape them off so they could see a little bit of truth I can t relate with the Democrats because I personally think that using common logic you can easily show that the Gender Wage Gap doesn t exist and that it s just a ploy to get woman paid more than men and I can t relate with any Republicans because I think it should be harder for criminal to get gun and that people are misquoting and misusing the 2nd Amendment But because of the Country we live in I m not able to use logic to stay in the middle I have to be one or the other This wa more of an explanation regarding point 1 I made now that I think about it but it s necessary

siggi zippan	To me a a Canadian he wa one of the better president in the US I am not a Trump fan because he is a dangerous demagogue who claim to be a Nationalist and to tell you a a German born I know what a so called Nationalist is about We had that in Germany in the 1930 s and it did not end very well in the long run You Americans should be very careful because if you invite this kind of person into your home what doe it tell u about you in the long run Like the Magicians Apprentice in Goethe s ballad Der Zauberlehrling it mean that when ask for ghost you never know what you get in the end and how you can control them That is exactly the message of this ballad So once you unleash the force of either right wing or left wing extremist how can you contain them control them So Americans be very careful because we in Germany in the 1930s couldn t contain the populist the Nazis and look what happened

Mr. Grey	A vote in this November s election actually doe matter No it often doesn t and a a former president you know that Unlike pretty much every other democracy on the planet we don t use a popular vote for our leader Your state s Electors are the one that vote and your vote is just a suggestion that they do not have to follow If you re in a red state and vote red you re a drop in a bucket of red paint if you re in a red state and you vote blue you re a drop of blue in a bucket of red paint There are people running for office that don t think woman should get equal pay for equal work People like you They already get equal pay for equal work when it s actually equal work but you wanted to give them more because debunking the Wage Gap myth is unpopular who don t think we should do anything about school being shot up Which is every president in office for the past 70 year including yourself None of you have the nugget to really go against the gun lobby Who don t think we should raise the minimum wage Again pretty much all of you Sure you ll make token attempt but none of you will really go against your corporate master Vote in somebody that share you value Nobody that share my value will get close to a position of power

Tribune Luke	Failed to answer a large reason why people don t vote Neither candidate hold value or represents what you believe Of course he wouldn t have an answer for that Party politics subverts democracy at all level reducing your choice to a binary option both of which aren t worried about your particular interest or concern I wish for a day I could ask some one like Obama such a question What doe one do in the face of a democracy that no where near represents what you believe or what value you hold What doe one do in the face of a democracy that operates with only the consent of it s own party member I did not consent to this current Government and I perhaps will not consent to the next Government Of course no one want to answer difficult question

Julia Nadeau	Excuse 8 I m sick and fucking tired of politician rigging election in their favor with gerrymandering voter suppression etc and when they get into office they end up supporting the corporate agenda over what s best for worker REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN Case in point the Democratic Primaries of 2016 What are you surprised that some of u are still pissed off about this Damn right we are I wa a Democrat since the first day I could vote And yet despite having grown up a a Child of Reaganomics despite their numerous attempt to vote away my access to the Means of Survival despite their numerous attempt to legislate me out of existence a a transwomen it wasn t Republicans who radicalized me into being a Socialist Why not Cause I expect that sort of evil and corruption from them But the Democrats I thought for year that they were better than that In 2016 I watched the DNC and the DCCC try to ram Hillary Clinton down our throat a candidate who loses popularity everytime she opened her mouth a candidate who wa so corporate that I could scarcely tell the difference between her policy and the bullshit politics of Reagan I grew up with In one key state after another I saw the DNC meddling and engaging in all sort of political fuckery like voter suppression and poll closing I saw their hand in sudden rule change and collusion with MSM to shut out Bernie and prop up Trump a a pied piper candidate I still remember having to watch Trump s empty podium on MSNBC while Bernie wa holding a record breaking rally in Phoenix AZ And you Barry YOU were complicit in all this in both your support of Debbie Wassermann Schultz and her tactic and your continuous support of a candidate that did NOT have the mandate of Democratic Voters That said I still voted in the general election DESPITE all this True I didn t vote for the candidate of either party but went third party because at least the Greens weren t wholly owned by the corporation But I can understand why so many pissed off Democrats chose not to vote I voted out of sheer outrage in a pyrrhic attempt to show the candidate in question the level of contempt with which I viewed them You Barry sat by and let the unravelling of our democracy take place You have no ground to lecture u all on the importance of voting I left the Democratic Party because of the blatant corruption of the DNC I am a Socialist because I watched democracy get used and abused by those who swore to uphold it

JCTJR98	Keep talking Mr Obama and reminding u why the American people repudiated your policy in 2016 Its feel so great to finally see our country not be taken advantage of by the rest of the world and have a growing prosperous middle class especially blue collar manufacturing working American s Oh remember the threat from ISIS missels being launching from North Korea Iran s ability to fund terrorist and taking hostage our sailor China s out right economic warfare and your Russians friend taking over other country territory Well that ha ALL stopped because we now have a United States President who keep our country safe and care for working American s So please keep making public aperances and also tell your friend Hillary Clinton to do the same especially when she defends her husband s sexual offense Thank you

if it doe so progressive don ’ t Have you no shame I have no idea who you are and why you are endorsing a war criminal How did you get my email I want nothing to do with you and deeply resent the day your group decided to endorse Obama This is attack on progressive and on American value The Trump Putin summit in Helsinki which so many found so shameful would not have been possible if it were not true that there is a moral equivalence between the Russian authoritarian regime and our government which give lip service to our democracy and core value Thanks to Obama and president before him we have no moral high ground And you want to celebrate this debacle by bringing back one the chief culprit of our national humiliation Shame on you You stand for everything evil the USA ha done Most shameful is that all along you talked about our ideal our value our freedom Everyone know this is just chatter not just because of Helsinki but because everything that came before that But for Obama Trump would not have happened The Republicans are equally evil Here ’ s Kevin Drum ’ s list of GOP misdeed “ As a sort of PS to my post yesterday about the decay that ’ s overtaken the Republican

Getting Wet With Sharkie	I don t vote ironically because of Obama A man who once promised change but failed to deliver and this happens time and time again with politician on both side They ll say one thing and then when they get into power they do the complete opposite Lets look at Obama a an example he promised to Close Guantanamo Bay Secure US border Sign a universal healthcare bill Restrict government wiretapping on US citizen Repeal the tax cut for the rich Withdraw troop from Iraq These are just the broken promise I can remember I m sure there are more It go to show that a politician s promise is an empty one I don t vote because I can t relate to the candidate And by that I don t mean woman gay people minority and so on that s all superficial bullshit I want a candidate that will represent me with their policy not their genitalia Making bad Pokémon joke doesn t make you relatable it make you a fucking jackass I don t vote because my vote doesn t matter It doesn t matter because the system is set up to make it that way We have the Electoral College super delegate super pac a two party system that ensures independent candidate don t have a chance in hell and even within those two party the system can be rigged in favor of one candidate over another All you need to do is look at what the DNC did to Bernie They pushed him out in favor of Hilary Clinton a candidate so bad she lost to Donald Fucking Trump Voting is a democratic right but so is choosing not to vote

Dana Moonfire	Obama wa the guy who abandoned the progressive base that got him elected and because of that the Democrats lost in the midterm He had his chance to get out the vote but instead he made it worse How much longer to we have to hear from this failure I think it is a very risky strategy for him to be the face of the Democratic Party That will only stir up Trump supporter even more
