Mar	A webo no entiendo nada 😓
ERTDA -	I swear Obama was the worst president of all time. He didn't do shit for anyone. Trump brought back thousands of jobs and is making life hella easier. People say that they hate trump just because he's "racist" which is not true. Those Demorats only say that because they do not want Trump to build a wall. And my question is why? Trump is not racist. He is doing the right thing. It is illegal for someone to just cross the borders like that. So what I am saying is if u think Trump is racist and the wall is a bad idea, then that just proves that you want things to be illegal in this country
Carl Taylor	To all the people who think President Obama was soooooo good: President Trump came AFTER him. Meaning he ultimately failed to carry on a legacy.

SlitherGravity	student loans? oh yeah count me in

Elias Krebs	I feel like the semi-cringey stuff he says/does in this video is actually him being a normal person who _is_ relatable, except that it sounds scripted in this context.
Swaggy P	Damn he low-key throwing shade at old politicians lmfao
Lora Coggins	I've heard that Charlie Baker paid Google to replace the top result of his main opponent, Jay Gonzalez, with articles about why you shouldn't vote for Jay Gonzalez. This is why I feel cautious whenever I use Google for election information.

Jack 1059	Obama was your most intelligent president. Was he perfect? No. But he knew what he was doing. Understood the importance of the job. What a guy. Yet the grand old problems propoganda machine churned out lie after lie against him. Evil lives and it's the GOP.

MezzaHD	HE AIN'T PRESIDENT NO MORE HAHA. OBAMA IS GONE.
Look its HAYZEUS	God, I love Obama.
CrashSable	It's the arguments against excuse 3 that piss me off.  If a person truly believes their vote is inconsequential, you are not going to persuade otherwise them by just saying "yes it does matter".  Or if you do try to present an argument for WHY their vote matters, you just roll out the same tired old platitudes that they have heard a thousand times before and already dismissed.  It doesn't matter if you think they are stupid for doing so or if you think they should have been persuaded by your argument, the fact of the matter is they haven't and they won't be until you have a real conversation with them and PERSUADE them rather than trying to bully them.  Equally, this always goes hand-in-hand with this idea that people seem to have that of the people who don't vote, they have all somehow reached a consensus that they would all vote for your candidate if they were bothered, but have decided to let the other guy win out of apathy - which is, of course, delusional and incredibly arrogant.

Tina Gavin	If the earth is flat what's on the back of the flat earth
Na No	People who judge politicians by their humor, character or any other superficial stuff are plain stupid. This is what makes Merkel and Obama (and Trump) so dangerous. Superficially they seem like they are cool and normal people while in reality you need a massive grief for power to even get that far. Don't get fooled and look at their real goals.
GLR	NOT SURE IF THIS IS REAL OR CG, just kidding, but you know what I mean after the latest tech reveals

Dorian Gray	womens have equal pay for equal works BUT with ALL "social" programs, with bigger medicine and literally all other financings, with longer live (cause of misandry and better and bigger financing of medicine for womens etc) they go to pensions earlier etc etc etc womens get A LOT MORE then mens. And i dont talk about monstrous unequality like in army when male, who fight in close combat have SAME chances for promotion with women, who make tea in headquarters, cause preservative Obama dont go live law, what can force womens soldiers to close combats in army... So yea, hypocrites, gynocentrists and just sexist pigs - sgut the fuck up, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO NEEDS TO CHECK AND LOST YOUR PRIVILEGES.
nisiO	As much as I miss him, he's not president anymore so it's not his official title
My Chemical Yeemance	The shade he’s throwing is hilarious
John Smith	Michelle is called Michael a tranny
Yanrique Torréns	He isn’t president anymore
Sazzorak Skills	There’s actually a website that we used in civics class where you can take a quiz and it’ll show you what candidate most aligns with your values. I forgot the name of it but if someone could find it I bet it could be really helpful.
Eugene Pro	Блять, Обама, верни лампочку из подъезда!
Chris S	I like the fact they don't acknowledge Trump is now president and not Obama
HC Li	Mr. Obama, would you like to come to Canada and run for PM next time? I'd vote for you
chi_jiggy	fuck me dead i wish i lived in a country where voting meant something but here i am down south in Zimbabwe
Kawaii Kitten	I miss Obama so much like he wasn’t perfect but he’s so much better than trump like i wish he could have stayed
Some Asshole	This was interesting but i’m still not going to vote. Real change doesn’t happen overnight because you voted candidate  A or B. It happens over decades because of a lot of factors, most of which aren’t even in the control of politicians.
franzurdaddy	r/FellowKids
Nonayur Beezwax	Why is it that i kinda wanna check out this voting thing? Honestly wouldn’t have ever happened without this video lol! Like is too late tho?
keven adarraga	Thank you sir for the time you take to stimulate us to get out and vote . In these dark times of our country , I think of Trump and I'm ashamed to be an American. Watching you sir makes me feel so much better Mr President.
5000 Subs with One Video	Pssst he’s not President Obama anymore just saying..........

Min doesn't give an f Yoongi	It's the worst time for Obama not to be in office.
amandagirlygirl12	When he said "there's no joke here" I laughed the loudest. GO VOTEBLUE YOU MORONS.
gthakur17	I like obama and wished he could stayed president for longer but by god I hate Hillary clinton. when she was SoS she was pro-pakistan, pro-Saudi and on many occasion snubbed India. Obama on the other hand respected and supported India
FieldsForQB	Pokémon lol
Kyle Hoover	Solution to excuse 7 cant be done at the time of the release of this video
Flash HarelKrash	"President Obama Doesn't Have Time For These 7 Excuses Not To Vote"  Um... guys?     Did anyone tell them he finished his second term?   Like... two fucking years ago?
Freddusya	If you are in the "I don't know where to vote" category,  I strongly recommend you not to vote.
JW Deet	Excuse #2 "Vote for people whose faces look like yours"?   Obama, the most racist president ever!
Wicked Amoeba	Lol, that Pokémon bit felt like a personal attack!
Hibble Djibble	How about "my absentee ballot literally never showed up"?
majorsupton	He is not a current president.
Ryan lex	Lmao worst president of all time😂😂😂
Tobby Isiba	Barry=frud
ZeratulTemplar	Throwing them out doesn't mean the next people are better
Michael Yoder	Great video! Love this man! Funny (or not so much), here in Canada employers are required to give employees 4 clear hours to go vote. GO VOTE!!!!
Jamara Gibson	I am a fellow German and this is the only President from America that I truly like. Obama is the best.
K	He looks like he got whiter??? Lol
Vexumy	If i hear someone say "Vote for me because i'm apart of the Lettuce, Grilled Bacon, and Tomato club", I would *INSTANTLY* vote against them.
enderpony80	Ex president:)
Boozer	Still my President.
Dave Vd	Who even cares about LGBT and Wahmen candidates ? Young old Man woman or attack helicopter aslong as it's a good president who cares...Sadly it's a popularity contest the last joke of a election proved that. Seriously the 3 best candidates they had are  1 a corrupt gold digging fence hopping whore 2 A spineless ancient socialist that got cheated out the candidate vote by said previous corrupt whore And 3 a freaking bussinessman/celeb/cheeto who has no experience running a company without issues ( bankrupt several times ) let alone a country.
Ali Kareem	this vid should go viral in all nations it's not just for Americans.
Brooks Bennett	Like Democrat’s know what the internet is. Like Hillary could fix anything. And Republicans are actually fixing it
MegaMasturbator	Lol Obama, its not the voting that's the problem, its all the damn corruption, sucking up to corporations and pork-barrel politics!
frek Cho	Man Obama I feel like you aging fast.
TikiDragon1	I guess he didn't have time to actually do anything too progressive when he actually had power. He could have done so much more.
Oscar Siddle	TBF it should say Former President Barack Obama
Lyle Hwong	I I realize I'm watching a U.S  President, who actually wants to live on planet Earth and be a part of Reality. - Thanks Obama🔭🎩
Bosun Fynes	You're missing one of the worst excuses,  certainly the one I've been told by my less responsible associates: "I don't register to vote so I'm less likely to get jury duty." ... Yeah.
CalvinSkates	My excuse that I’m under 18 how do I tell all these advertisements to stop
S Ohat	MY vote literary does not matter. Its not an opinion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig  The big problem about this "7 excuses" fails to acknowledge that current US democracy is more an oligarchy rather than a democracy.
Evan Kauffman	"THANKS, OBAMA!"
Alpha0727	Thank you Mr. President! Maybe now people will actually use GOOGLE themselves instead of complaining about not knowing something!
ultra nova	I probably wasn't the audience for this but it popped up
Coco Azcueta	can you believe i started crying because of how much i miss him
Roni Väärälä	Obama seems a lot happier now that he is "free"
Simon	As a European, please just vote those republicans out so the world can move on!
Someone	-FORMER-
Athenas Nova	He’s not our fucking president anymore so cut the shit
asddf asdqwe	how about :  dont vote because you are not educated on politics and economics,  or : dont vote because you are ignorant to both sides of any issue
john doe	Yes Obama. We are where we are because of all the people not voting, letting others "filling the void". Can't wait that more people are voting, so the world becomes a better place, with politicians applying only what they have been elected for. Amen.
Rockie_Road	👏👏👏👏👏
Kate D	Wow! Not once during this video did he mention the size of the crowd at his inauguration, insult a whole ethnic group or throw a 5 year old's temper tantrum!
CMV Robison	He is NOT president anymore... thank God!   WRONG title!  Glad he is gone. Trump is not any better. Well...better than The Clintons the criminals!!!  What is wrong with this country? We have not had any decent leaders in many decades! So so sad!!!
Kinnundo	does president obama have his own youtube channel? because he should
Jasmine	I love this man. Best president in my admittedly short lifetime.
Monkeyman Da Beast	Last I checked he’s not the president
Ethan Hanson	Man, I wish I could trust this man. If only his actions were reflective of his words.
First Name Last Name	Wasn't going to vote but this is so obnoxious that now I'm going to to vote Republican
Jana Höning Music	Okay that internet argument there got me. If I was living in America I'd go vote right now lol
The Land of The Destitute	Fuck you Obama. Thanks a lot for killing Gaddafi and making libya,afghanistan,iraq and pakistan into a even bigger shit hole.
Jacob Kessler	im republican and because of obama i going to vote
Nick DeGugs	Ok, that’s it! I’ve had it with ads that say “get out and vote” when they really mean “vote left” and now you’re jumping on this bandwagon too Obama? Most of those people who didn’t vote last election were Bernie Sanders supporters who weren’t going to come to the aid of someone who cheated him from the primaries. Who’s party is responsible for that now? It’s gonna take a lot more (or at least it should) for a candidate to be relatable than just being a woman or LGBT. They need to have a policy that matches the voter, like NOT reducing suburban jobs through higher min wages, or NOT believing in a flawed wage gap study. Furthermore, another trend amongst these ads is to insult our elders. 3 of my grandparents are dead, but while they were alive I trusted them more than the leftist groups that spawned in your second term!  I don’t believe in identity politics, but for the record, I’m a millennial college student and I have lost all respect for you Obama, I hope your misery lasts another 6 years!
Hasekura Akira	I love him. The most versatile president ever with all his witty remarks.   Oh and he burns them.
Over World187	When i say "the president" I don't mean trump , i mean the real president of the us and that is  obama
Liberal bias	I don't care for my depression and thoughts of suicide, but that dont mean its not gonna keep coming back to me every day.
Stardust Nothing	Thank you Obama...
i am a box	Yeah and I’ll be staying home on Election Day.Sorry Obama but I hate politicians. Their all idiots. (On both sides) Its garbage in, garbage out. They could give a fuck about you and what you want.  They only care about themselves. A bunch of rich people who have no clue what the average American has to go through everyday. Also to be honest I think that if you vote an idiot in, you (the voter) are part of the problem. I didn’t vote for anyone, so I’m not part of the problem. So yeah, I will be staying home on Election Day. Sorry if I took a few lines from George Carlin, but every word of his is %1,000 true. It’s the reality that no one wants to hear, but it’s the truth.
MsTurn21	"... scrolling through endless photos of your dinner on instagram. That's boring".  I shouldn't laugh this hard 🤣🤣🤣
Sim	If this doesn't get more than 20 m views soon i think we should all agree the world's fucked up beyond repair.
MrFantocan	Well I like you Obama, but voting kind of screwd us here, in Brasil people were so pissed with the economy crisis that they elected a FAR RIGHT DICTATOR...   His son even met with Steve Bannon, so yeah here he won with 55% of the votes so, yeah we F'ed!
Wongiwe Madlavu	I feel like Americans have no idea how lucky they are, they have no excuse not to vote, cause at least in America you vote for the candidate so you actually choose who you're voting for. In South Africa you vote for a party and we have very little say on the members of that party. Hence we ended up with former President Jacob Zuma for so long. So Americans please, just count your blessings and vote.
imicca	Funny but i still don’t like his politics
William Winkle	Obama is the reason why I wish that presidents could have unlimited terms.
CasinoR	Notice how he is still called president Obama. Like the one you got now is not real :Y
jinxmaster1	President Obama is not relevant anymore.
SkyPain Games	He missed the best one. Your vote does not matter! Well I guess its not an excuse. It's facts.
Switch Back	No I’m a moderate not a centrist  Moderates in politics means (create balance between the two party to prevent tyrannical control or completely flood the votes to assure the party that has to win to create balance) If you think you can win based on sheep people  We’re not sheep we’re deciders that destroy you to create new possibilities  To recycle is to reform.  If you don’t like it then go to another country if you don’t like the term “balance for the greater good”
Top Gaming	“Working their tails off” Rawr Xd *nuzzles you*
Dominiq Akoraa	Title's wrong though
Fiona Sullivan	wow president obama is pretty sassy
Vexillology Hub	Why bother voting when Phil Swift isn’t a candidate?
Jesse	thank you obama, very cool
Heartless Forever	I'm dont think he was a good president at all.... but I cant deny he was a good person! Love him as a person not a president.
Super L4ura Lazuli	nice, some great free propaganda Goebbels would be proud
frenchbreadcrumb	Oh hey, one of the worst presidents America base ever had! I thought we were done with this fear-mongering goon...
Albert Weijers	Still a cool dude...
Sigurd Jensen	Winner takes all system discourages voting, get rid of voting circles. How's about a percentage-based system instead, eh? So we can get a bunch of different views in more frequently. Vote blank if you don't like any of the candidates. Tactical voting doesn't show your actual interests. Not voting and voting on noone is completely different, because it's easier to see a blank vote as a statement that noone in your area is doing what you want done. I believe, as a non-american, that most americans were fairly indifferent on yesteryears presidential nominees. Imagine if only a handful of voters actually voted, and the rest turned in blank votes. It may not have changed anything, but Trump might've instead won with less than 10% of the votes between 2 nominees. Imagine what sort of message that sends! Vote for noone: It's better than not voting
Bragi Bragason	God I miss him!
Moose’s Stop Motions	He’s not president
MangoMania	15 seconds in and I'm instantly triggered
Luke Powell	He's still refusing to accept trump is repairing the problems he caused

Darko Bakula	Can Obama run for president again? I think he was a very good face of America.
Asasin 03	Obama is #Notmypresident
Maria Lønborg	I dont even live in america why am I watching this xD
Red Ivy	Votes are like Hornets, 1 or 2 isnt enough to make much happen, but a whole hive will change somebodies mind.
Nita Shahini	He’s not the president anymore, let it go!
Phil Lenan	But why would Americans want a women for president? Every male dominated society wont interact with you the same way. Its just a lose lose situation, that only narrow minded liberals thing is an advantage. -.- Sorry to disappoint anyone, but it is how it is. Otherwise a lot of good points, but most countries need a more direct democracy to stimulate the participation, in my mind.
Shark. Jo	American democracy ist broken
geronimo8159	The "I don't care about politics"-one is pretty immune to any argument. If you're completely ignorant, there's not much to do...
Eduardo Gutierrez	If he said "I'd stay for the party, but I have to go vote" that would have driven the point home.
Arouet	I might not agree with his politics, but on a personal level he still seems like an incredibly likeable, reasoneable person. Sure, your two-terms-limit makes perfect sense, but I would prefer eight more years with him as the president over Big Orange any day.  Please go and vote during the mid-terms!
poop 69	i dont see a ring, is he back on the market??? asking for friend
Imani Malaika	Voting is important. Even more important is holding elected officials accountable on issues that affect your daily life. Politicians who do not respond to the needs and voices of their constituents in the general populace amounts to taxation with representation. Identity politics is NOT the same as representation. For too long, politicians who look like us continually fail to represent our economic interests. WE MUST NO LONGER give politicians an excuse to not know what we want. We must REPEATED AND EMPHATICALLY tell them and demand they respond, instead of them telling us what is important.  Once elected, a politician govern ALL citizens. Not everyone votes in every election or ballot measure, but every single one of us gets taxed, even on a pack of gum. Most politicians choose issues that either are designed to be emotional triggers just to garner the most votes or that actually deflect from critical health, economic and privacy needs of the citizen majority. Big money donors and corporate entities have an inordinate influence on public policy. If money is considered to be speech, then constituent voice must have equal weight.  Politicians must take into account life changing legislative outcomes and how people will affected by them. Citizens should have ready access to pending legislation and its relevant outcomes. Established legislation should be publicly cataloged on the basis of impact to constituent groups and updated in real time. Citizens are responsible for letting their voice be heard and have the right to responsive governance.
Averagejoe04	Poor Obama, he over here looking ancient and we want him back so bad. Missing Obama 😞
Curt AppleKing	I’m 16 I can’t vote
Dr. Phil 2.0	Trump 2020!
Juckle	I got get how people can say they don’t care about politics. Politics pretty much affects your entire life. It’s your future. When you do nothing, you are pretty much saying you don’t care what happens which is dumb. Also a lot of these excuses just shows how lazy Americans can be.
slayyy yy	Never realized how similar Obama and the rock sound till I watched this
Squishy Potato	*OBONGO BEGONE*
foodhatesme	Obama - "Vote for someone who identifies like you rather then voting for someone who has good policies..."
THE KON	Yes everyone please go vote. MAGA !🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The Puncakian	Nice way to plug your agenda Obama.
Daniel Fogg	Excuse #8: I live in the District of Columbia...
Dash ToTheMax	Way more people die from suicide than gun violence. The numbers by them self are comical and our current knowledge about how the brain works is a joke. If it bleeds it reads. Neurology might not be fun to study however the applications will be if used properly.
Savannah Orozco	Hey Obama, I know you can no longer be President, but I think I know someone in your family that can. I know her stance on the matter, but her country needs her, I miss the Obamas in the White House. Michelle 2020
Jack Lance	I dispise trump, I hate his divisiveness, I hate the damage he has done to the environment, I hate what he has done to the country’s image, exploding the deficit, I could go on, but the democrats need to stop pushing social justice down our throats. Yes, having women and minorities in power is great, but there are other problems going on around the world and the us that merit more attention than social justice. Climate change, nuclear war, Qi, education, etc. the dems need a new message or you’ll never win over white people who disproportionately turn out to vote more than other race. I’m socially liberal, fiscally conservative, but I hope the dems stop pushing pc culture because it is obvious at this point in history, they are the more rational party and I hope they beat out the republicans this November. I voted for the dem candidate for the house in my district already
Hayden Jenkins	Ex-president!!!!! By the way, thank god.
Tminus K	It's only a matter of time before a vast majority of Washington is filled with our 20-30 year olds of today, we just need to make it happen. We are the future whether those who disagree like it or not.
Ortens Grabbar	*HOW CAN OBAMA BE SO WHITE???*
Science 2020	*Ex-president
Eleazar Moraru	This is basically just a democrat propaganda. You either vote with your feelings ("i miss Obama") , or with facts ( Trump administration currently is doing so much better than Obama Adm. in every single aspect)
THICC raw sauce	Excuse #8  I'm not old enough so get the fuck out of my recommendations
McGuigz	The democrats DO NOT GET IT.... im  not even american and i can see it. America doesnt need "more women or more LGBT politicans" THEY NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE THEIR COUNTRY FOR THE BETTER, the only way america can change is by electing REAL Left wing candidates who will change the economic equality of the country not pander this Social equality that liberals have been advocating. Just because you are a women or a person from the LGBT community doesnt mean you are a qualified progressive. Its been the neo liberal policies of the past 40 years in the west that have created a greater gap between rich and poor. Putting a gay neo liberal or a women neo liberal face on things isnt changing the fact...... that they are no different than anyone thats come before.
Joey Freeman	What if I don’t agree with you politically
AllAboardTheDankMemeTrain	0:19 you be playing with some serious fire there Mr. President.
Shaqmares	Please come baaaaaack
John	A tad condescending was it?. Fuck you Barry
667 ape	thanks Obama
Braden Bungard	How do you do fellow kids?
Budder Nubbs	THANKS OBAMA
Blaise Potvien	Such an icon
woodchuck 00	Think vailed attack ad. 'We are an objective news channel,' objectively left yes. Obama's words are filled with straw men. I miss the Obama that thought States should be able to decide thinks like gay marriage. I miss the Obama that believed in a strong border. I miss the Obama that said it is irritating when his machanic doesn't speak English.
Liberal Larry	Are we going to vote for the same policies that gave us Trump? If that's what we want we should vote for Joe Biden,Corey Booker,and any establishment Democrat that takes big corporate donations and supported Hillary Clinton when it was Clinton VS Sanders.  If we want to vote for a TRUE people's champion, not just one who pretends to be one when he's campaigning like Trump, then we need to vote for someone who doesn't take corporate money.  Their is one person who fits this criteria, and that is Bernie Sanders. The most popular politician in the country according to polling, who painfully obviously is fighting the hardest for the middle class (against the powerful when needed,) BY FAR.  If you think he's too old to do the job: 1.Biden is the same age. 2.What does the job require: Youth and good posture, or an uncorrupted person who doesn't take corporate money, has a good understanding of what ordinary people need and has shown they're willing to stand up for ordinary people against the powerful?  Was Biden or Obama calling for Wall Street bankers who caused the recession to face justice?No. Could it be they didn't because they took money from them? Yes. (Corporate campaign donations are, unfortunately, legal, and unlimited."Open Secrets" tracks them)
Michael Rivers	Already voted early; and will continue to do my civic duty and vote.
RandomizedClips	This is the first time I’ve ever seen President Obama talk so normal. Like he’s actually a person and not a robot. I’m conservative and a fan of President Trump. But I’m not gonna deny that Obama is a great person!
Izzy Gallegos	President Obama, I miss you!!!😭
Fleet Simons	"you wouldn't let your grandparents pick your playlist" 1. pandering 2. yes i would, good music didn't suddenly spring into existence in my lifetime, my gm was born in 1919, she knows fire 3. the dems are a capitalist party. the dems are a capitalist party. THE DEMS ARE A CAPITALIST PARTY. 4. any progressive or "socialist" who runs as a democrat, regardless of intent, will become part of that machine 5. if you're really a leftist then demand what we need: a party INDEPENDENT of the 2 capitalist ones. a party that will fight for the the interests of the workers, and ultimately for the overcoming of capitalism. doesn't that sound nice? 6. this video is insulting.
Drew Glenn	Worst president ever
Spicy Leprechaun Stuff	Bastard.
Burn :D	God... He is sooooo lovely, fucken hell...
Aaron Muck	Listen, I think Barack is a cool guy, I personally didn't like what he did in office, but he's funny as shit and a pretty upstanding guy, but I have to disagree with this video. Me personally, I have plenty of reasons not to vote, although I'm sure most of them only apply to Presidential Elections, I still choose not to get involved. A few reasons on why I choose to not vote.  1.) Me personally, I prefer to be a centralist, and it's not because I can't pick a side, but it's because I don't like the fact that we only get two choices, Republican or Democrat, there's no middle ground when voting, you're either pro guns or anti guns, pro abortion or anti abortion, you're not allowed to find a middle ground, because the people we vote for do not stand in the middle ground, it's always one or the other.  2.) The State that I live in determines whether or not I have a chance at voting for who I want, and not what the State wants. When you vote, you're actually voting for who you want to vote for the President. And most would think that the person you vote to vote for whoever you want, would HAVE to vote for who you want to be the President, but that's no the case in 24 States, including the one I'm living in, they can vote for whoever they want. And since I'm more of a centralist, if I were to vote for someone who goes against my State's views (Being that we're a Red State), then there's a very small chance that my vote would ever matter.  3.) In a perfect world, I see people voting for who they think will do best in office, not someone who's within the same political party they attend in, which means that I would prefer to vote for Independents rather than Republicans or Democrats, since I see them as people who care more about facts rather than sticking to one side so hard that you'd need a scalpel to scrape them off so they could see a little bit of truth. I can't relate with the Democrats because I personally think that using common logic, you can easily show that the Gender Wage Gap doesn't exist, and that it's just a ploy to get women paid more than men, and I can't relate with any Republicans, because I think it should be harder for criminals to get guns, and that people are misquoting and misusing the 2nd Amendment. But because of the Country we live in, I'm not able to use logic to stay in the middle, I have to be one or the other. This was more of an explanation regarding point 1 I made now that I think about it, but it's necessary.
Samuel Wilking	#redwave #MAGA
Zackery Sharp	Im just now of the age to vote, so I'm finally into politics. It seems that people love Obama's personality, but never payed attention to to terrible political choices he made. And they hate Trump because of his terrible morals, but don't pay attention to the great things he's done in office
Ryan Adams	Send this to Trump and have him go on an angry tweeter rampage screaming that Obama is no longer president lmfao let the fires fly
DaEpicAdam	He's not "President Obama" anymore - it's 2018!
Blankace	You didn't even answer the first question, you basically said "Vote for Women and LGBT+ members" like that means they have good political views.
Nano Sanchez Lopez	Can’t wait to see Obama and friends get indicted 😬
Repeat After Me	Go out and vote but only for my side
kijiji93	Deep down, Donald J Trump knows that he will never be truly as popular and as loved as Obama is and that eats him alive inside every day.
NaCl H2O	Naww.. I’m good, Mr. Obama.

IH N	Darn now I'm so hyped to vote... too bad I'm 14 :(
Doc Brown	I’m not an Obama hater or anything, but the title should say former president, because that’s what he is. Even he wouldn’t deny that.
Arya1999	During the last presidential election, if everyone who didn't vote had voted (neither for Clinton nor Trump), Trump would have lost spectacularly. He'd have had 10 percent of the votes.
A is O	When people say they cant relate to politicians it is because all politicians favor a neoliberal econimic policy and millenials who work shit Jobs dont get exited about candidates who are great on social policy but just as bad as Trump on economics
FreddyFish	Why bother voting when I cannot find any good Democratic. They all care more about identity politics than policy so I throw it away. Useless candidates.
SV SCRIB	Begone thot
Ling G	This is a president, he just exudes leadership and calm!
bessie	Damn dawg, I really miss you Obama

Hell i dont even recycle however greet party it is. i bet you that Democrats and Republicans are working together from under the table to control USA, and look like they are against each other infront of you. they are busy taking turns controlling the country, this is not Democracy.  it is democracy if its over 3 parties and they all have almost equal chance in election. Money should not control who gets elected.
02091992able	Well its better to try to get people to vote that are citizens than try to make it so illegal immigrants can vote and not be naturalized citizens of this country.
HockeyBaseball09876543456789876543	I don't vote to piss off people who do.
Tank Slapper	Not even half the population votes imagine how different America would be if EVERYONE voted I promise you at least 60% of our presidents would be different.
Uncle Mike	So we just gonna elude what he said about pokemon
Jacob Gharib	Love Obama
Wessel Nossent	isnt it just obama? hes not president anymore
Dallin Lee	He’s not the president.
Helen Chen	Love him!!!!❤️❤️❤️like this video before finished watching it. Midterms are important guys, if you’re able to vote, do so. Stand up and decide for your own future. Get informed and make a change.
Evan Blake	He's currently the former president, but I get the point of the video.
Samuel Cho	so if I couldn't relate with the candidates...I can relate with woman, LGBT, and veterans?...What do any of these even have to do with relating with candidates??
Alex Jordan	“You can’t use google to find out which candidates believe the earth is flat?”
MizcatTV	*Alexa... Close youtube*
Alberto Diaz	0:16 Sorry, Mr. President, you lost your credibility right there.
Tom Stamos	I respect this man immensely, and I vote republican. Very down to earth and relatable man. All around good guy. Job well done sir.
Arrow xD	Does anyone else think that Obama sounds like The Rock?
Torterra	😢 Barack Obama doesn’t care about me?
CrazyRandomLord	The two party system has failed time and time again to fairly represent america's citizens. If you want people to vote then give us some actual fucking candidates. What really needs to happen is for campaign finance laws being enforced, first-past-the-post to be replaced, and some accountability for campaign promises.
Jeremiah Fyan	Ive said it b4 and ill say it again. I don't like Obama's policies. I dont think he is a necessarily good person. But my god does he seem chill af and he is charismatic, I've gotta hand it to him
starlight	God what a lovely man. He's dearly missed, and I'm not even  an American. Bless him.
DMC1	I agree.
Wade Flores	love you Barry
J u l i a	QUEEN
The Unicorn of Power	Do or do not vote. Not voting is a vote too. Don't make people like Obama, Trump or Clinton feel all important. Take care of your own life and maneuver around the inevitable obstacles placed by any of them
Jack Barry	Desperate lefties
Masta Cheese	Barack Obama was such a good president that his full name changed to "President Obama"
L'Oréal Roaché	I MISS HIMMMM! LOVE OF MY LIFEEEEE!!!!!!
Hannah G0123	I miss Obama, wow he’s amazing and funny 😂
Butch	Someone from Austria here, so midterms and all that jazz aren't terms i can do something with, however, i think this actually got me thinking, me, someone who give less of a pufferfish fart about politics, to maybe even go and give the next vote a check. Thanks Obama.
golden salmon	This video seems like a massive bash at old people
Mack Burwell	Thanks Obama
I-95 Vlogger	Except for voter registration. That'll get you!
Aiden Hunter	As a conservative I never agreed with him on a political point of view but I always liked him as a person, I think he's the kind of guy you could have a beer with and gladly spend time with
Maya Corpening	man... i love obama  the wokest of the presidents
Canalave Maiden	I don't have time for all the people who keep feeding the demon's game. If you don't play, you don't lose. Go ahead and miss Obama.  Next you'll miss Trump.  Hell, you "miss" Bush Jr.  What the hell is wrong with you people!?
Iconoclastic Artist	I miss Obama.
FoxOwne	*Former President.  You had a lil typo there Bubba, thought I'd fix it for ya.  And before anyone replies, I'm just shitposting, I don't like the guy but I ain't gonna deny his presidency, haha.
Tristan Neal	“Pokémon GO to the polls!” -Hillary Clinton, 2016 “I don’t care about Pokémon.” -President Barack Obama, 2018
Animation time	Voting is boring
Whoofian Brony	Damn. Obama dropping knowledge
Samuel Moore	Voting doesn't matter for several reasons.  1. Redistricting. You can "rearrange" districts so that no matter who the people actually voted for, the person the people in charge want to win *is* going to win.  2. Electoral college. Self-explanatory, you can Google it.  3. Even in popular census, the opinion of the American people means nothing to our actual representatives. Statistics show that no matter what the common people want, the politicians will do what their owners (lobbyists, CEOs, etc.) want, as it makes them *fucking* *money* . Why do you think we keep spending billions and trillions of dollars going to war against people who can't even defend themselves while in our country we have schools using books from 20 years ago and more empty houses than we have homeless? Why do you think alcohol is legal and marijuana is not? Why do you think these megacorporations can't "afford to pay 15 dollars" an hour even though the cost of living is through the roof and people are having to work 2 and 3 jobs just to pay their bills while some rich assholes who was born into his wealth rakes in more money than he can spend in a lifetime?   America has truly become the Rome of the West, and we're going to fall even faster than we already were if we keep letting the wealthy burn down our nation just to keep their toes warm.
Wyatt  McFall	He’s not president
TheMysteriousMan	Ok fine you made up my mind. I’ll go vote for all the conservatives I can. Thanks Obama.
Sigua Tordé	in Australia we have compulsory voting!
RoloC4	Damn Obama lookin like Oldbama
Iiro Yli-Salomäki	More like president obama roasts rebublicans for 5 minutes
Chris R	I don't care about whether a man or a woman represents me or if they are into men or women. I care that they fight for the people, and not corporate interests. How have they still not understood this after Hillary "I'm with her" lost to an orange buffoon!
Viviane B	Obama, you are the best! I hope that for the next election we elect someone as kind and considering as you or better. Thank you for your time as president! We miss your decency and class!!!
hans lousberg	what I always thought to be a good argument was to go out and vote: political parties want to maximize the number of votes in favor of them. this by doing/saying what you think is important.  But if you don't vote, there is not even an incentive for these parties to align themselves with you.
Bainzy	his eyebrows colours looks off compared with his hair colours
US Election Center	His arrogance is ridiculous, his ignorance is still the same. No wonder Trump won.
Lucía Cesar Braceras	U.S.A. go out there and VOTE
Björn Natan Bjarnason	He should get his own TV show.   You hearing this Netflix, Amazon, HULU?
James B	I'm not even from the USA and I miss him. Please, all the sensible people, go vote! Trump is an embarrassment to the world +++++
Big Blue Art	We’re not Americans were American’ts
Daniel 786	You should never vote on someone just because of their race, lgbt, or their sex.
KyleCorbeau	The true American Dad. <3 Miss him so much.
Mr V	Hello my fellow kids— Barack Obama
DAT ALIEN	Scum, glad he's gone.
Frosty	DONT VOTE ITS PROPAGANDA TO DRAG IN CLUELESS VOTERS, these ppl are scum
Pianobob	Can you prove that your vote will improve your country? If not, how do you know it's not ultimately counterproductive?
Smileandwavelol	2:28-2:36 Someone call 911 I just witnessed a murder.
Leo sun	I miss Obama one of the best people and president god bless him
Maty Nezhoda	I don’t like mark zucerberg
Dean Brandsma	he isn't president anymore, dont call him that
Alex S	If Voting Made a Difference, They Wouldn't Let Us Do It.
Volteer	"Midterms are boring" is the stupidest thing to say ever. Do Americans really think one single representative should have so much more power than hundrets of them, to the point where they think the election of all the others shouldn't even matter? I thought they don't like authoritarianism...
Jaji el Men	obama's so cool
Nadiina L.	I have never seen him look directly in camera and so up close.  He looks diferent.
Milla Romanov	Don’t forget that a lot of native americans cannot vote, because they dont have a legal adress, just a P.O. Box.
Thatcher Nap	Do you think he'd be doing this if young people heavily favoured Republicans?
Thomas Cowley	my excuse is that I'm not American
Sophia Astatine	I forgot how amazing his voice is.
TheSoldierCore	Excuse 8: I'm not american and don't live in America.
Teagan Alexander	Someone messed up big-time with the title.  It should be "Former President Oboma," not "President Oboma."
CB Custer	I still have a hard time getting past #3 (my vote doesn't matter).  His best example was of a victory margin of 100,000 votes, but that's still a huge number.  My problem is that most policies are not passed by congress or governors, but enacted quietly by unelected officials in executive departments (EPA, FDA, and the Departments of State, Treasury, Defence, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, HHS, HUD, Transportation, Energy, Education, VA, and Homeland Security).  My vote won't come close to touching these offices and the policies and regulations they enact.  I need help, guys.  Change my mind XD
-Gemberkoekje-	Getting dangerously close to "Fellow Kids" there Barrack...
Gnarwhal	I disagree with voting when you're uninformed. Let's put it this way, would you get ya girl pregnant just because a sign told you to?
MusikCassette	well aparently he has time for them.

Total War Destroyer	He's NOT the president anymore
HunkleAndrew Youtube	Obama would be a great youtuber
Dav Mcq	fuck him and fuck trump oh and piss on the next president also
Andrés Ordóñez	Ex-president trump is the new president, lol
Braden Kinne	Kids all saying they "miss Obama" even though they have no idea what he was actually doing for 8 years and were probably too young to ever vote for him
LeztGG	But I'm not a citizen of the US, how can I vote
Jahaziel Cipolla	My excuse is I’m not a citizen. What do I do, Mr. President
Subwayd00d	Ex-*   *epic style*
Simon Lu.	This guy is so more competent than Donny...
I Love jun	He’s so beautiful
Red Baran	We miss you! Even if we didn't always agree with you.
Kristina Starkie	Yep you are right for the first time....YOU JUST REMINDED ME TO VOTE RED.  you are done Barry!|
Shubham Jaiswal	Is he the coolest president that zuckerberg thing says A BIG YES!!!!!! P.S. im not an american so idc but i like his style
Rick Thornebush	It looks like his skin is getting whiter.
Lucretius	What if both candidates aren't good? What if you voted before and the candidates aren't doing the things they promised? But do vote if one of the candidate is decent otherwise not choosing between two evils is a vote in itself.
Space Alligator	*ex-president
Erwin Rommel	Good president or not He is certainly a great man
Steven Sosa	Amen! Doing the Right thing and voting November
monsterfurby	Obama's "would love to have a beer with the dude"-index is off the charts.
rtrefil	Goddam Muslim Communist get the hell out. You want a country to run go to Venezuela, they are right up your street.
Mac Attack	As a Canadian, your vote is 10x more important than ours, so please vote! Trust me, if I could I would! American and Canada are meant to be best friends but that’s not really happening right now and I hate it!😔
BigFreakingCacodemon	So proud to do my civic duty. Can't wait for the red wave! :D
Tyler Nope	Yikes. Not in jail yet. Soon™
Nigglai	thanks big daddy obama.
Valdagast	Is "I'm not American" a valid excuse?
Stephen M	shouldn't it be like ex president or something?
Ethan Tanguay	this made me want to vote, and i definitely did not before.
Emily Schueller	Well, Obama, you continue to exclude people like me even as you brag about being inclusive. Nice try, but no thanks. I will wait for a candidate who cares about people like me.
Clown Alan	Excuse #8: I am still not voting.  Now stop sending me text messages to vote, local "Government" #illuminatiConfirmed
Devansh Kolanu	ALWAYS CHOOSE NOTA- None of the above
riccccccardo	It’s proven voting does nothing for blacks in the USA or UK there is zero representation for black needs and wants so voting is a pointless endeavour if you are black.
Riux	Why does the title say President Obama when he's not president anymore
Harris Avaan	Americans don’t give effort to even vote and expect their country should become as EU. Fuck you.
Greykolla Sunneva	Jesus, he was just an actually nice human being!  I feel so sorry for the Americans 😞
ZHC	Ok why is Obama funnier than me
Artificial Gravitas	Man, the whole world [well not Putin] misses this guy, to think he actually made us like the US [well a little], madness!
domininkas zukauskas	"...can't relate to the candidate.", what the hell kind of excuse is that?! You don't have to relate to them, they just have to be good at what they do, which I think very well ties into the point that they made about the whole deal where you should vote for the candidate that stands for your values and in your opinion takes effective action to promote/propagate them.
Napoleon Banaparte	https://youtu.be/T7rESOe4Hps (Rofl)
Ryan Kelly	The gender gap is a myth just gonna say that
camdevtube	The fact that people think their vote changes anything is precisely why the rich and powerful stay rich and powerful while everyone else just gets fucked over. Do you people ever plan to wake up or are you content being sheep until the day you die?
joysm mawooa	You wont win again you lazy ass.Go in iran and continue to make great deal with dictatorship.

Holybloodfull	No.
Sierra Jerome 092	Minimum wage is fine as it is now. You should've got a good education so you could kind a better job. You cant raise a family on McDonalds.
James Maxton	Fuck Obama, change my fucking mind, don’t force the fucking ignorant to vote, that’s how we get idiots in, plus, who the fuck cares if the candidate sucks cock or takes it in the ass, the job is to make America great not to connect to the public by sucking cock
Daniel Cremeans	Didn’t say my reason for not voting
Eric Thompson	OBAMA I MISS YOU!
Ken Su	Democracy is the Illusion of Choice. you country is run by Zionist Jews. if you vote you allow them to use whatever puppet you voted for and do their bad things in his name. the only way to save america, stop your wars, and take back control is by refusing to vote. without your vote, they can't really do anything.  Say No To Voting. Take Back Your Power.
rave grey	we need a Hitler for the LGBT community. like if agreed and text amen😂
The Big Spoon	Go Trump he’s way better than Obama
edmund	I turned 18 just last week and today I went to cast my vote for the midterm election along with my mom and dad. It feels good to be part of the system!
Morgan Norris	I love how he said this to EVERYONE. He never mentioned parties. He just mentioned stuff that applies to everyone. Just like how politics should be. The people of the US first before political parties
LeonTV TV	*I just noticed Barack’s Eyebrows like wut da*
Haider H	This guys needs to shut the hell up 8-years and office and not one thing done. He literally set the precedent for Trump. Besides, i will never vote democrat or republican both parties can burn.
w	Who fucking cares if women or lGBTQ are running? We want a good candidate and that's it.
browifgopro	Barack beta male obama
WetToesAndSandscrapedKnees	make sure u vote trump for #trump2020 this obama washed up donald trump the new mega MAGA superstar.

jaxton funk	It says president in the title which is wrong
luke walsh	fuck Obama.
Andy Lao	MOST PEOPLE ARE SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM!!! For third party- even if they don’t perfectly represent your ideals, they sure as hell do more than the democrats or Republicans. and don’t give me the “they’ll never win” shit. The two party system influences the most with debates for publicity, debates where one can only speak if they get a certain percentage of their state’s vote. The two parties SET THOSE RULES. Last I remember that number was about 8%, and not only that, the more the nation sees “oh people actually support this third party- maybe I’m not alone” THE MORE THEY WILL VOTE FOR IT.  I want this to happen not because I support their policies, but I cannot stand seeing my country driven apart by the two party system. So much Americans hating Americans, nothing getting done, group polarization and the death of common sense and decency in politics.
P B	How dare you talk less than praisingly about Pokemon. 7.8/10 too much water
Jeanine Hansen	I don’t even think Americans know how much their political choices matter to the rest of the world. America is a super power they’re are a country that influence other countries in meny different ways; their economy affects most ( at least the richer countries), current political views/discussions are often compared or shared, even war because of NATO or the shooting lines ( Denmark is right between America and Russia’s shooting line, we’ve had history with being afraid of being hit by a boom/missile by “accident “ )
tha1ne	I'm going to vote for my local republican candidate. Thanks Obama, I wasn't going to but you've encouraged me!
Bob Smith	Kk I’ll go vote conservative.
Chessman Robbins	He is such a charismatic person but it would be nice if this was just to promote voting instead of promote voting if you agree with certain ideals
michael burt	I don't care about Pokemon I cannot wait to catch him catching a motherfuking Pikachu on his day off I swear that was the funniest comment to this video
An untrue definition	As a non-american, to my american friends, your vote is more significant than mine as the most powerful country in the world. Your vote matters, your foreign policy affects the entire world massively

Expose Nation	Fuck Obama
Thomas Heiner	Don't worry Barry I Absentee voted for my home state WI from all the way out in CA, I’ll probably only vote absentee from now on because this gave me literally all the time and freedom to actually go to all the candidates websites and read about them before marking down my votes I highly recommend everyone do it too

Videos From Space VFSW	What about this excuse: I DON’T LIVE IN AMERICA!! Everything isn’t about you. What about South Africa people are idiots and only allow us to vote every 4 years. In South Africa you are likely to be under attack if you walk alone but it is way worse than America. But still Donald trump says we have a crime ridden country but he should look at New York it has so many attacks or robberies everyday. Now I realised I wasted my time on this comment and I have totally gone off topic. Stay in school kids and wear a seatbelt.
Maarten van der Poel	03:10 DON'T USE GOOGLE, TO LOOK UP INFORMATION! Use Duckduckgo, else your voting information will end up in the hands of the NSA and maybe even politicians..
Josh Standing	Obama looks like an onion
Chris Johnson	I don't vote because I don't believe in a democratic republic, and I don't want to support a system I don't have faith in.
Xorloz The Noob	"you have the chance to change America" Trump wins 2016 election
ChouzetsuDynamic	2:45 Oh Barry.... why do you strawman so much? This could have been good. Nobody believes that women should earn less for the same work, that is just misinterpreting what is actually being said. Women already earn the same for the SAME WORK. Men choose different careers that tend to be more scalable and they take more extra hours. All measures meant to make the system more "fair" to women are basically Feminazi positions meant to segregate even more. Nobody wants to do nothing about schools getting shot up, what everybody is trying to figure out is HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS. You can't just implement gun control or gun bans in a state and expect it to suddenly be safe, that might be your "solution" but it is none in reality. Look at Chicago please. We should not raise the minimum wage. Raise it and millions will lose their jobs. Companies won't be able to afford the same amount of people for higher wages so if you actually implement that, you will see a huge rise in unemployment. What you could actually do is put regulations on monopolies like amazon who are killing small businesses. If small businesses thrive, then low skill jobs will thrive and then the problem is non existent.
marieblueangel	Love using the absentee mail ballot to vote! Really saves me time and I like how I can turn it in whenever before the official Election Day
Kaffekaffe Kaffe	Just shut up, you didn’t do anything yourself when you had the opportunity. Your not different than any other American politician, bought and sold...by big corporations
Gurprem Singh	There was a time when people were dying for the right to vote. And now people don't vote cause they are lazy.
Matthew W	Vote for progressives not centrist traitors like Obama.

Daniel Cristián Escobar	Cant relate to candidate? I dont vote for men because their men. Thats stupid
akiru bamiru	Mr Obama, even through you are officially not a president, in my mind you are still a president, while the orange head doesn't look so!! He is acting more like a gangster than a president whether in national scene or international scene!!

habijjj	Yay another go out and vote video that definetly isnt trying to get me to vote for his side not at all
David Caddy	It still astounds me that the USA does not have compulsory voting like we do in Australia. For a country that prides it self on being so democratic, it seems like you guys are just paying lip service to that claim.
Nikki Vail	Remember when Mark Zuckerberg talked to all those congressmen who had never used the internet before? LOL I ❤️ Obama
Sebastian Danckert	As long as an American presidential candidate who gets the least voters but still manages to become the president I don't understand why Americans would vote at all.
Luellen Genres	He's so effortlessly cool and charismatic.
White Shadow	JayZee and Beyonce might be there, if they're voting early too
Pertti Man	Now that's a real president. America took such a step forward when you elected Obama but when Trump was elected you took such a step backwards.
Squim	I have a friend who won’t vote because he “doesn’t want to participate in activities which legitimize an oppressive capitalist system”  Mr. Obama, could you address this please?

osten/сыр /der Käse/the cheese/le fromage	Sure, I can't relate to any candidate because they are a straight male, not because they have quadruple the paycheck I have.

BestBro Gaming	I love Obama
Kostas	Why does someone have to be LGBT or a woman to vote for him? shouldn’t people vote for what the candidates stand for, and not for their sexual preferences or gender?
Xerathiel vi Darquise	Lemme start a war in syria to free the people for a sec
Greg Esch	Hmm. So women, LGBTQ, different races? Great! How about actually smart and maybe someone who is fact not fake driven? Dems are too PC and Reps are fake news, religious nuts. Dont care about the side, dont care about color, gender. Brain is all one needs.
Brad Last	I mean.. hes not the president anymore though so the titles kinda wrong
AvarageCracker69	Am I the only one, but does Obama look more white than black
Crisis	President ok buddy that not correct. TRUMP 2020
Larry Hovekamp	Those who don't vote should not get in line for their Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs.  All these programs came from people voting and voting their interests.  Stupid non-voters who don't vote and yet can should learn to suffer from their ignorance and willful negligence.

Yeppy McYepFace	Please Obama, Jesus Christ, come back
clayton delanie	Obie is still the worse Prez. in the history of the USA.  He still owes me $2,500.
Wasteland nomad	Remember when Obama came into office with both Houses and was perfectly setup to take over the SCOTUS but then he went around like a big pussy apologizing for America, bailed out the banking elites, failed to close Guantanamo Bay, brought forth a socialist General Motors, weaponized the DOJ and the IRS, gave guns to the Mexican Cartels and ISIS whilst starting two additional land wars in the Mideast when he campaigned on ending them all thus becoming the first President in American history to spend all 8 years at war and then proceeded to lose over a thousand seats across the country including 37 governorships, both Houses and the Presidency who then went on to confirm two Supreme Court Justices?  Good times. Good times.
james elder	If you don’t like the democrats ,republicans or any of the other party’s why should you vote for someone who you completely dislike
RAsplez 98	Great, more "vote or the bad people get in power" propaganda. Like there's actually a good guy in either situation...
BlakeShawn Music LLC	Ladies and gentlemen, this is what a real MAN and real PRESIDENT looks like. I miss you Barack. Let's vote these scumbags out of office. 🙏
Zack E.	Except he isn't president
Portis Anaran	This is the worst video in history
Angie	So charismatic. Wow.
Ian Standio	But he has time to mass murder people in the middle east using drones
Cole Something something something darkside	I still thinks he is honest.
Brian Bommarito	I have something I wish to read to you, and after reading it, you tell me whether or not you still think your vote matters. “Then Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan, and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness for 40 days, being tempted by the Devil... So (Satan) brought (Jesus) up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth... Then the Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. If you, therefore, do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’” (Luke 4:1,5-7). Would Satan have offered this power to Jesus if he couldn’t give it? Elsewhere, it says: “We know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19). So, now tell me, if the Devil rules over this world and it’s governments, as the Holy Scriptures say, and he sees to it that the only persons in office reflect his twisted thinking in their policies, do you think a rule of majority vote by the people will make any difference if the Devil himself does not approve of the candidate the people are voting for?
Justin Rowland	I expected him to encourage a vote for democrat candidates and he did. The least he could do is not throw his own opinions in there
[ RavenNinja12 ]	Good thing that bomb didn't go off
Anon ymous	Very biased video. You should not vote if you are not informed.

Etienne Aubert	Oh Barry, you still don't get it! Americans don't listen to a seven point motivational videos, intended to get young people to vote; they listen to three syllable chants, like "Lock her up!", "Build that wall!" or - this one might even ring a bell - "Yes, we can!"!
doggone28	Excuse #8: I'm not 18 yet... damn
יואבי אייל	What about the reason- The bourgoisie gives us the right to vote only to distract us from meaningfull political activism that can really change our lives- a revolutionary anti-capitalist one
Umar Hadi	Grab em by the pussy
Lil neilA	How come I didn’t hear him say uhhh
CrimsonNerd	I love this man.
dcooks93	Can we just have you back as president again, there has to be a way
BattleWatchTM	This guy can make jokes. The other guy is the joke
bloody blood	Ex president*
Simon Cowell	I love Obama so much ugh. He’s such a chill dude.
Carter Howlet	My excuses for not voting. 1. Im forced, by YOUR party Mr. Obama, to watch your stupid interpitive dance ad on youtube again.....and again.....and again.... I NEVER do something that people are persistantly suggesting I do especially if it involves giving them something. How is a guy dancing supposed to encourage me to vote anyway? Do you think Im stupid? 2. I don't want to do jury duty. You vote, your name is put in the pot to serve and can be pulled out multiple times. Voting is not an inconvienance, Jury duty is. 3. 100,000 votes =/= 1 vote. I don't have 100,000 people in my town. Not all of us live in New York. Fuck you for thinking 100,000 is a tiny number. 4. People are savage on who they vote for and would automatically assume Im a horrible person. I could possibly be killed or injured because I accidentally told the wrong person who I voted for. I could keep it to myself, but then I set myself up to appear neutral and therefore subject to your shit voting campaigns. Think of voting as a way of keeping antifa off my ass and blowing my car up. There are my reasons. And if you keep up with this crap in my face I'll vote. FOR TRUMP.  M.A.G.A. Bitches.

pyronmasters	I wish Michelle Obama ran for President.
Hidde van Lingen	this thing cost ATNN 500,000 dollars
JJ Coleman	What a disgusting thing to insinuate, that Republicans don't care about schools getting shot up. Of course they do. They just disagree on how to go about it. Screw this guy. Glad he's in the past. He was and is devisive as ever.
Victoria Marks	Excuse #8 I am under 18 and cant vote even though I am probably more informed than some adults.
pokeluxer	he aint president, straight out lying lol

Martin Gerup	Miss Mr O  He had a way to talk right
InfamousRenegade	Why am I here...I'm 16
Bob Wasab	First off, you SHOULD NOT be voting if you are uninformed, this is why Congress is as shitty as it is today. And if you don't like either of the candidates then research the libertarian party, they have some great alternatives.
Данил Юлык	I love this video. Even though I'm russian I like thinking that somewhere there are elections which can actually change something (shoutout to mr. Putin) Bye-bye now, think I'm going to GULAG.

Leo Odgers	I found a YTP edit of this: https://youtu.be/wdYHWBCh8RY
Alfred Peverly	I don't vote for politicians who make attack ads. So in other words, I don't vote for politicians. So I usually end up voting only on the policies. But even then, most of the time I have no opinion on political policies anyway
Ethan Rajan	If he just talked instead of reading a script this could have been awesome
Dain, son of Nain	Lmao he never closed Guantanamo. Lying ass

Tomasz Dabkowski	Public speaking skills don’t turn communists into humans.
Garrett Neumann	I was going to vote. But then I found out Obama doesn't care about Pokemon.
Eagle 367	Screw Obama. He's a war criminal who authorized the murder of thousands of innocents in the middle East and then somehow still got a Nobel Peace Prize
Joshua Andrew	Why do they refer to him as "President Obama" when they refer to President Trump as "Donald Trump"?
TmzR	former president*

Izzy TheYoutuber	I miss him so much

King Daniel	How does the majority of the population relate to LGBT ?
DigitalメSUSHI	Man I want him back at least he was actually helping the country instead of building a Wall around Mexico and make Mexicans pay for it and waste all the economic resources on a cement wall
Pold the only	How about "who ever wins won't change anything because republicans and democrats are the same"
stone aldridge	I'm pretty sure the can't relate question  had more to do with the fact that most of our politicians are morons and less to do with the gender, race, or sexual orientation of said morons but maybe that's just me...
Elena Coutinho-Taylor	Bolsonaro and Haddad are in the running to become president...even though we’re forced to vote, the Brazilian way of not voting is in blank. I have no confidence in either becoming president and I don’t want to vote for someone that I have zero faith in...
Voyager7005	Great president
Eddard Einstein	Thanks Obama! Voting all red this Nov. Democrat are being too cry babies these day. None are like JFK, most are cry babies especially that crazy maxine. Damn her voice sounds like a dying donkey
Irene the Fire Cat	Serious question: How can I vote for the Midterm Elections (specifically the state of Florida) as a US registered voter studying abroad in Asia?
Umberto LaMatta	I’m glad Trump is our president now.
sup dudes	Former* president Obama
American Guns HD	1.) I don’t care about politics.....(same people who complain about them.) 2.) can’t relate to the people running? (People will never fully agree with each other, but there’s that middle ground.)  3.) my vote doesn’t matter. (Yet again like number 1, same people, who still complain.) 4.) mid terms are boring. (Number 1, yet again.)
carine Taha	love how the title says president not former president
badabings.tv	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrDB3mITfG0
Wooden Hope	Reason 8 why you should vote: November 6th is my birthday and my wish is that you all who are US citizens and reached the legal age to vote shall do so 😊

Josh Weinberg	Thanks Obama
MaszCiLoos	Hello USA people! Please, do vote! It's extremely important, because it will shape not only the future of America, but also affect other parts of the world. I'm counting on you! Love from Poland
Rose Stone	He's not President any more. Just say Obama.
Tension blast	thank fuck you're not president
Big Game Shane	Donald Trump should have given all the people who didn't vote enough motivation to vote against him. He's done that for me, I've never been more motivated to vote.
Kevin Thompson	Obama doesn't have time for None-Voters...Well Former President Obama you had 8 years...8 years, 8 years to change the world and you wasted it. You are the weak excuse for not doing anything...you Schmuck. Ohh and how's the Mansion in D.C?
John Winter	I'm sorry, wasnt it under the Obama Administration that Angela Merkle called the US and said she didnt appreciate being spied on? That was Obama, right?
J0uke	President Obama? he isnt the president
PhilfreezeCH	God I miss this guy.
Rash Rash	Did he just look more white in this video/
Morgan not a man	Don’t vote just based on your political parties !! Do it based on who you agree with!! And if that is mostly your political party go ahead, and if it’s not don’t vote for them !!
Claire Reidy	I’m studying abroad in Germany right now, and I still made sure to fill out the proper paperwork and send in my absentee ballot because voting is important.  If being in another continent didn’t stop me from making my voice heard in this democracy, what’s your excuse?
Pekarn	He is not the president anymore.
wagner55	I bet the dislikes come from Pokémon fans....I laughed at that lol
Tobi Abidoye	Lmao I can't vote I'm only 14
Mikael Tiilikainen	I miss obama god damn
swushey	If the candidates suck, I'm not voting. If you're not ok with that, change the law so an election requires a certain percentage of voter turnout to be valid. I believe in a third option.
Superdoo987	bellend
Thijs Wuytens	He's telling bull shit and he knows it
Patrick Milewski	When did Obama suddenly become near-progressive?
Fuarian	It's not that your vote doesn't matter and others' do. It's that NOBODY's vote matters. Politicians are bought through lobbying. IF we want to fix politics we need to get rid of the money involved.
Mack Dickerson	The GOP and Trump tried to assassinate The Obama Family using a homeless,mental patient as a pawn??? The racist GOP and WHITE house must be removed from office??? As you see fit??? Trump is a terrrorist??
Manas Kapur	I miss him

Raditya Nugraheni	I laughed at the Mark Zuckerberg part
Rachel Misner	i saw obama, i have never clicked on a video so fast
Gardstyle35	There people running in the election who think that women shouldnt be privileged just because they have breast. If they make less money cause they study stuff there is no demand for in the free market, or because they work less hours that is nothing sexist.  Most representatives are whites and male, because most people who go after a carrier in politics are white and male. Thats not sexist either.  If you want to force those things to change with quotas than you are oppressing people.
The Aesthetic	“This thing has something called Google “lmao bring him back
stinky	why doesn’t this have more views?
SoSanderGames tuinstra	Since when is he white

Shivam Tyagi	A message from non-American: I respected America and Americans a lot when Obama was president. But right now, I don't think I can.
Akilesh Balaji	But he is not the president
Craig Barrett	So the point of this video is to get moderates to vote despite the fact they don't feel represented by either side, with the hope that they will pick the democrats as the lesser of two evils
Fré	He doesn't care about Pokémon..... -_-
thesuper hellminator	To all of you trump haters Hes a fucking billionaire, what are you? He makes money off real estate what do you do? And finally he has done so much more good in his presidency than Obama because Obama literally sold nuclear weapon grade plutonium to some arab people
James SOLDIER Austin	OBAMA 2 PACA IS A BETTER RAPPER THEN TRUMP O YESUS.🎤
Maddie	Guys we’re half way. 2 years to go and the orange skinned rat fuck is out
Carlos Moreno	Piece of shit killed upwards of a million Middle Easterners, overthrew progressive governments in Libya and Honduras, funded fascist paramilitaries across Colombia, bailed out Wall Street by the billions, and did nothing to help lumpen afro and Latin communities in his own country and expects us to give a shit what he thinks.
Lance Uppercut	In the next election there should be lots and lots of people to choose from who are poor or standard earners  who are the same as us not billionaire nutters, an Not just a Duche 💦 or a Turd 💩  People done like to vote for who they don’t like especially the young.  And yes the old sell out the young every time pay attention to the world and vote for what you want!!!.
BobThe Gamer	Imagine if every country could vote for who the next president was. Things would get strange real quick
419NigerianPrince	This is just liberal propaganda
Tiana Nu	This guy gave the Iranian gov the power they shouldn't have had. Why is he here?
Mani Sefas-Loos	This is so hard for me to watch because although I love Obama and I think he’s great and he did many great things, I recently learned a couple shady things about him that is hard to get passed. In a way, Obama represents the old me, the establishment democratic me. Now I’m democratic socialist and a progressive and I’m in to more progressive people but I used to be pretty establishment and Obama reminds me of that. He reminds of someone who genuinely is trying to do good but is missing a few key steps. I hope this makes sense.
Space Faring Civilisation	Can we vote for Obama as president of earth? 😀😎🎬
Vincent	I'm not even American...
Troy Kleppe	fuck obama
Wun Ford	#4 😂😂😂 Who agrees?
Tom Reed	We all die anyway
Chris Viggiano	I don't like Obama he is delusional
Josh Green	Don't vote for a party..... vote for your values.....and don't let Fox News, MSNBC, Trump or Obama decide what you value. Think about what could make your life truly better in your day to day, conquer your practical problems and think a little long term for good measure
bigboss05	wow obama is so cool man hes so relatable talking about coachella man why isnt every adult this cool man wow
King Wasteman	Jeez this guy is funny. Best president, and I’m not even from America😂
Vodka Belinski	This is so cringy
iamgoku2024	This seems like encouraging propaganda
The Escalator	Yep, gonna vote republican
Dre	The one good think I do attribute to trump is that many liberals including myself had the chance to hear a lot more of the conservative side. What Obama says in 2:45, I would have thought as most on the left to be intolerable but really they’re complete strawmans meant to deceive the uninformed he so desperately wants to vote in favor of corporatist democrats.  1. The gender pay gap is an absolute myth. Individuals behave in manners they see as economically rational. Women on average do not go into the highest paying professions (all STEM jobs) at the same rate as men do. With maternity and child rearing, they also take time off from work (for obvious reasons). The idea that employers are avoiding the chance to decrease their labor costs by 70 percent if in fact there was an actual gender pay gap is hilarious. Complete democratic talking point  2. Again, saying conservative don’t care about mass shootings is a COMPLETE straw man. Every single proposal introduced by the left in congress would not have stopped ANY of the recent shootings, LITERALLY.   3. Minimum wage is extremely complicated. It’s not that one side wants to avoid paying people. If you incorporate minimum wage like New York has, you effectively outlaw  cheap labor, hurt black/ minority employment opportunities, increase the cost of living and consumption, and encourage employers to tend to automation and cut even more jobs to save costs. All you’ll leave the worker with is rising housing costs and little in return.
Kashif	Why have you bombed libya you motheryucker
MrAwawe	Do you still refer to ex-presidents as "president [last name]" after they leave office or is it just that the left is delusional? I guess I don't know the proper etiquette when it comes to people who have left office.
it's a me Mario	Hello there fellow kids
M AA	Stop voting!; do not submit to the illusion. Obama is its black face for white Judeo Christian pagan hegemony, like the tom in the master's house. He could not have gotten "elected" without submitting to the council of foreign affairs. They are the ashkenazi program set up to run the world. Study history. You can run the country if you avoid it. You can never catch your shadow, but if you leave it, it will follow you...
Jhoshua Wolfox	Sorry Bama boi, i like you, i love you, i want you, but still, i wont vote. Might the world eat itself fighting over its own ignorance and greed, i'll just stand by watching.  I mean, its not like it even matters, wasn't Hillary Clinton supposed to be the president with a 10%+ more votes than trump?
Dimitri	Rename the title to "Former President" not "President". He's not president anymore..
David Dalmatian	Thanks Obama
James Morris	Look I'm just gonna say. They labelled him "President obama". He not president
Zwaks	"...you wouldn't let your grandma pick your playlist. Why let them pick a candidate that will affect your future?" Woah!!
the_apple_of_my_eyes	But, I can’t vote yet :(
Daniel Whyatt	My god sure you have gotten grey. I mean I know time isn’t kind to politicians, but damn. So glad you’re at least out of that danger house now.
jeff the accountant	A fucking icon
MysteryBounty	Here is the thing: our votes do not matter. They absolutely dont matter at all. Trump lost the popular vote, bush lost the popular vote, but because of the stupidd ass electoral college you dont need to have the most votes you just need the vo5es from the rich white people whos votes actually matter.
TheColombianSpartan	This dude is low key roasting us
Renai Brown	President Obama Doesn't Have Time Bombs Blowing Up In His Face

Salt And Vinegar	Damn deepfakes have gotten so good!
MjRauff	Daddy why did you leave!
Lerzoos Lercoos	I don't give a fuck about it
Jeff Bezos	Why not make the voting day a federal holiday? It’s so stupid
I hate blacks	Link this to everyone. People should disown adult children that have the ability and no excuse to vote but don't. We need a better republican than Trump
Thea Bruun	God, I miss this guy. And I'm not even American. This guy has good political values, a nice sense of humor, and he knows how to talk in a way that makes people listen. If America doesn't want him, he can come to Denmark. We will gladly have him.   But can he please run again in 2 years, so that the voters can "Make America great again", cause it's certainly not great right now.
_____	4:03 his jokes are so cringe he’s trying to act”hip and cool”
Bobby Rode	more women more lgbt candidates .....bruh why does the gender of the candidate should matter ?
20quid	Obama doesn't care about Pokemon? Looks like I'm straight ticketing for the other guys.
Loor	Daddy <3
jerryhsiehbig	Can Obama run for 2020 plz??
Aram Garibyan	Yea let's raise the minimum wage so places like WIngstop could pay their employees higher wages while they can't take basic orders.  Seems legit.  If anything the minimum wage needs to go down.  Way down.   I don't want people flipping burgers making $20/hr.
Александар Дмитров	as a non-American, I think he was the best president of the USA. Don't know too much about your politics but he always seemed calm, collected and articulate. Listening to him and trump speak is like listening to a toddler and an English teacher.
Matt Deemer	The Mark Zuckerberg point was good
Dany Dady	He just implied that Republicans think women shouldn't get paid the same as a man if she does as good a job... and the worst thing is people believe this idiot.
iisimbaii	why aren’t u running b?
hairythe tablefry	Thanks Mr. Obama for helping me see clearly. I'm getting off my butt and voting for Donald Trump this next election!!!
SuperSaiyan3985	FORMER President Obama*

CJz	I'm not old enough to vote but this video was amazing
Buckett Bunny	I love you Obama
Apoxiosis	so wait mr obama says i can vote for the woman or the lgbt because thats the only way to relate to them? yeah, fuck their ideas, relate to and vote for them for their gender or their sexual preference.  what an absolute unit this guy is
Cody Overton	He sure seems to have time for vacations though that hasn’t changed
sirdeadlock	I voted. Mail-in ballot FTW.

Moke n Friendz	I love Barry
I'm Iron Man	Obama is that guy I would grab a beer with
siggi zippan	To me as a Canadian, he was one of the better presidents in the US. I am not a Trump fan because he is a dangerous demagogue who claims to be a "Nationalist" and to tell you as a German born I know what a so-called "Nationalist" is about. We had that in Germany in the 1930's and it did not end very well in the long run. You Americans should be very careful because if you invite this kind of person into your homes what does it tell us about you in the long run? Like the Magicians Apprentice in Goethe's ballad (Der Zauberlehrling) it means that when ask for ghost you never know what you get in the end and how you can control them. That is exactly the message of this ballad. So, once you unleash the forces of either right-wing or left-wing extremists how can you contain them, control them. So, Americans be very careful because we in Germany in the 1930s couldn't contain the populists, the Nazis and look what happened.
Amy Lopez-Mendoza	What about moving to a different state a couple months before midterm elections??
Hal 9000	As Impotent, Intolerant  & Hateful as the dems have become along with  their Hypocrisy & Corruption, there's no way Millions haven't Fled the party.

William Smyth	Wow! An IQ 100 times that of Trump!
Dom.	Obama looks white
Random Asexual	My Statistics book had a question about a guy named Amabo. The entire class laughed. The end.
Benjoleo	I am disgusted by how many of you morons praise this monster right after he admitted to not caring about pokemon
My Bald Self	Come back, Barack!
Logan Snyder	My only excuse is not just that I'm uniformed about the issues, but that I don't have time to become informed enough about the issues to cast an informed ballot. I work at least 85 hours a week, any free time I get is going to be spent watching YouTube or Netflix, not reading about political candidates.
Colleen Armstrong	“President Obama doesn’t have time for these excuses?!” He didn’t have time to be the damn President.
Nuh. Abdulaahi	Omg I miss him so fucking much
Klamath 2046	Obama embodies the best of the American spirit
dominichokage	I would like to remind everyone that James Comey did not vote for Hillary Clinton even after closing the investigations into her.  Don't be like James Comey. Please vote, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican.
Goldfish_Vender	He looks a lot whiter
Iluthra	Thank you, Mr President. We miss you!

Naruto Brady	He looks too light
Datch	He’s not president
Harry Hildebrandt	Obama, please play pokemon.
DestinyC1020	I was cracking up at minute 1:25 lol... Obama should seriously consider a side-job in comedy hahaha.  He has a dry sense of humor lol.
IvanJinx gg	Remember when the US had a good president? Neither do i...
ICE WOLF	I miss Obama

Consumerism_Is_A_Scam	****FORMER****
T Sama	I couldn't vote because I'm on probation. The court literally took most of my ammendment rights.
Jim Huang	Isn't midterm more important? Because you are voting for people who actually make laws and people represent you, right?  Person from outside US.
TheSweetestJerk	Doesnt matter who you vote for really. Think about it, its an imperfect system ran by imperfect humans. It was doomed to fail before it was even made.
ProWrestlingMP1	Take a shot every time he says "look"

JookerSK	OH.. Man .. This was a President of United States of America :D
Val-Zod	I'm sorry but.......who and what am I voting for exactly?
bts army	I'm not American I'm English and I don't know a lot about trump's policies. Like I keep up to date as in I know about  the kavanaugh scandal recently but that's quite big news. but I don't like trump simply cause he split kids from their families and put them in cages. And that he giving  teachers guns as a response to stopping shooting in schools. I just don't like his whole attitude on guns as a whole. Also I think Obama does care cause eventhough he's not president any more and knows he can't be in power he's trying to get people to vote for who they want in power by trying to get everyone to vote and trying to get everyone to vote on obviously makes it fairer.
soph da loaf	I MISS HIM UGH
(Squall Leonhart) Donnie	I would love to vote. I don't have an ID, can't afford one and no car to get there. Some of us are poor.
Jordan Stier	Used to be my favourite US President, but now he says he doesn't care about Pokemon. What a loser.
Quarantined Cosmonaut	I love you

DeathLotus	Obama is a straight Savage lmao, super cool dude!
Nova Saint	Hes not a president anymore and our votes clearly dont count thankfully other wise Hillary would be president not to mention I dont care
Galaxy Girl64	1:00 now how is trump president?
ThaGodWeCreate	I don't have an excuse to not vote...i made a conscious informed decision to not support or condone this horribly corrupt 2 party system...i hate both parties and i hate politics. I hate tha corporate interests, special interests and lobbyists. I hate tha lies n division n constant corruption of both parties that only work for tha wealthy elite. I hate tha fake smiles n hypocritical disingenuous attack ads. Can't stand any of it...neither party represents me at all and i consider myself both liberal and conservative in tha true definitions of those words. Lastly, i don't vote because when this shit crumbles, as it always eventually does, when these politicians screw tha middle/poor/working class folks, as they always eventually do and when it's all said and done at least i know I'm not personally responsible for taking away anyone's rights/freedoms whether left/right and I'm not responsible for tha impending recession and wealth transfer or any other mess politicians create. YOU voted them in...YOU are directly responsible for tha greed, corruption and evil they produce. That's YOUR fault, not mine. I didn't even see a polling place on election day so all their bullshit has NOTHING to do with me...after all I didn't vote...how can i be responsible? That's why i have NEVER and will NEVER vote. Maaaaaaybe if someone actually ends tha war on drugs...maaaaaaybe ill vote for that person as long as they are an honest, decent human being. So yea...i'll probably never vote. Just my 2 pennies...have fun fighting over which master you group-thinking losers want to follow. To me...repub/dem SAME THING!
FlaMasker	But I'm not American....
hrpang	I wish American voting is easier.  Like the first step is making the Voting Day a National Holiday so people can actually go vote without worrying that "Hey I'm gonna miss work for elections."  Another good step is... Making Automatic registration a thing. Like... Many countries have that. Heck these countries happen to also a stable government. We have the technology to literally put your name down and say "Hey you, you gotta vote. You have been registered automatically thanks to a bunch of geniuses in front of computers." Plus it would be easier anyway.  A more contriversial move would be to disband Democrat and Republican entirely and instead change it to where "Hey, I am a candidate, and I have a team of people who I believe, that along with me, can change your life in America." That way you can find that person who shares your moral compass without having to worry that 'He is a Democrat' or 'She is Republican' anymore. You can be Pro-X and Anti-Y and you can find a dude who has the same ideals.
Trey TDG	#FUCKOBAMA
snillhund	God, I wish i could just be able to ignore all the assassinations and shit so i could just enjoy his charmisma
knory123	Yay I'm so pumped to vote now! *realizes I live in Europe and am not a American*
Intellectual Media Man	This man did stuff for 8 years You guys just don't know it
jawad mansoor	There is no way he can come back? Like he is dead?
Hansruedi00mc	Well, hes not really a president anymore, more of an ex president
Don Legend	Fucking bullshit, the NERVE he has! He had a democratic House and Senate in his first term. He could have done gun reform, Medicare for all, change prison reform, appoint A progressive Supreme court judge, take on wall street and increase the minimum wage. He did NONE of those. And now he is telling me that i’m sleezy if I don’t believe in voting when he had the power to do all those things but didn’t?? He is just  neoliberal trash! You are sleeping, he is just a smooth talker.
The one who laughs	He’s not president, fuck this guy, sucked a fat one in office for 8 years
FrenchieFries	I voted early and was the youngest one there. Everyone else was in their 50s or older. So if your 18+ just take 5 minutes to learn about local candidates on google and go vote!!
Rebecca Danae Cortés	Use Google AND BallotReady.org
Riga Grubis	We miss you :[

Maritza Diaz	MY NUMBER ONE
The Locust God	We wouldn’t have to have Obama beg us to vote if he actually did something worthwhile in this country when he had a super majority in Congress.
Chavrios	TRUMP                  Not my president
EA	Mid Term elections are probably THE most important. The President only passes pre-decided policies and makes it look like he did it. These candidates YOU choose end up making those policies! Sooner or later this will directly effect america's Future so we need better representation!
TheGreat Gatsby	As an Indian citizen... All I see is this guy giving millions of dollars to porkistan... A country who harbored Osama Bin Laden and attacked India 26/11 Mumbai attacks.  I see a guy who went after another Indian American guy just because he was conservatives.  I see a guy prosecuting Edward Snowden.. As a citizen of India, a country with the second largest population, I am thankful Trump is the president. Vote for Trump in 2020.  Trump banned the terrorists and also stopped giving porkistan millions of dollars in aid.!! Trump 2020.
Matthew Vu	Obama is a former president reiterate the word former.
Savvy	I love President Obama being so sassy! Lol
marta Lis	I don't even live in America i just wish Obama was my prime minister
Muhammad Arif Prasetyawan	I'm not American, but I'm watching that because Obama!

Tamahagane	sorry isnt he EX president obama?
Fif0l	I miss the times when you could vote for human beings. Now it's reptilians all over the shop. What's the difference?
rina m	I miss having a president who can make a joke not someone who is the joke
KingKhanAbz	He should die his hair black and he'll look young as hell! ☺
hello world	"no worries obama is here, what can he do, he can bankrupt your country in days!" obama 2020
‘Murica 1776	So the democrats realized that their problem is that their proponents insist that *voting doesn’t work* and then realized that it’s their own fault that Trump had the majority of votes in every state and nearly every county.
Toby Brooks	God, Obama even makes me want to vote - I’m British
astro	the moon is flat
Ella Ingram	nothing but respect for the only president I acknowledge
Daniel S	Hes not a president
Lolz Mmilh	Lol this is just political propaganda
kaz kk	The sexuality , colour of skin ... Of a candidate doesn't matter. It is the policies and social restructuring that matters . But this doesn't happen ever since the game is inherently rigged.
James Lim	Notice he looks younger AFTER he stepped down as president?
Athanatov	Didn't manage to refute any of the arguments. Except for #6 I guess.
Jes Jürgens	As long as there's still people who believe he's the messiah and others hating him for being *insert racist insult here* and/or being on the "wrong team", there really is no hope. There was no change and there never will be change.  Stop legitimizing sociopaths' hunger for power.  Obama is as much of a monster as Clinton and Trump.   You cowards disgust me.
abr xas	wtf are you saying bro what's your deal bro like wtf "I don't care about pokemon" you sick freak bro wtf
Shalaka	American politics doesn't concern me directly. But still, I'm glad for people like Obama who make you want to sit down and listen to him. And besides, his points are valid for all kinds of elections around the world. I don't know how did America end up with Trump though? Seriously guys what went wrong?
Jaren C	I went to register and was too late. Smh
c122 h122	I work 2 jobs and I can't find the time
Doppelkammertoaster	The problem with this is that the political system to actually gain power and drive change in the US seems to be flawed from an outside perspective. I also would prefer politicians who don't think only along their party lines but what is good for the whole country. I would gladly vote for those, but I don't see that happen because of the party system. And as long as that doesn't change I vote for the less worse candidate in Germany.  In another note: Why would any vote be in the middle of the week to start with? If you like people to vote, then make it as easy as you can.
Elizabeth Quigley	Not American but when Obama is on YouTube you gotta see him
RISHABH SHIVHARE	I like how Obama relate things
AllHailVenom	I’m in Australia, but this still awesome.
Komal Hans	I misssssssss you Mr.Prez
boy buster2	He forgot one "I don't like the candidates"
Max Sainz	Need something to vote for first.
Mawasam	His ears are sooo distracting!
bjehulk	He seems like a such a nice down to earth guy. It’s a shame he was a terrible president
Boris Marte	So if I understand correctly, Obama wants people to:  Vote for candidates that share my ideology, not necessarily having the necessary competences or effective proposals.  Vote to remove from Congress people who [insert here any right wing (maybe misrepresented or oversimplified) policy contrary to left leaning ideology].  Base their opinion on politics on Google results.  Interesting...
Adam Rafeedie	Voting RED BABY
A meme Kiwi	Instead of trying to be cool for the younger generation to vote, candidates should be more serious. It’s like using a rap song to teach 18 year olds how to do taxes instead of just telling them.
Lindsey Jacobs	Just voted today. Thanks Obama.
Doug Fitch	This guy is so good👍
Slit Bodmod	Obama: How do you do, fellow kids?
George Manjgaladze	why are there so many leftists here?
Demonhornz	Obama is a scumbag, liar, and traitor.
Misterkanister	I will never vote
jabby basilio	And your replace him with a actor from apprentise haha trump is a joke
Umer Khan	Hey love u
connrrs	Im conservative, but not a hardcore Trump fan. I'm also not a nazi. I like Obama, he has such a good talent at public speaking and is truly a great person. But before you vote, at least educate yourself on what YOU believe is right. Don't vote whatever the media tells you to vote left or right bias. It is important it is that each individual in this country needs to think for themselves.
Josh Conrad	What candidate thinks that the Earth is flat, gun control would only make schools get shot up more, the Earth is starting to cool (the temperature of the Earth fluctuates), the Democratic party literally had children blocking the streets (protesting) as they beat peoples heads in, and justify it because that person is a "nazi" because they go against their political agenda.
John Collins	Boo smells jungle ly all up in here doubled our debt worst pres. Ever
SummerIZSunshine	Why not just make voting mandatory? Works well in Australia. Though I'm sure there's a reason why America doesn't do it but it just seems like the most permanent fix vs reminding people continuously why they should vote. Also how do you know that you're hearing the opinion of the entire country?
Raja Muhammad Afiq Raja Nazirin Shah	Hate him or love him but you have to vote
William Nobody	Still not voting
Adrian Vargas	G O D
Ioanna Maria	I am not American but I want America to have better President cuz Obama at least tells Jokes not like Donald Trump who is a real joke . Obama is my President 🇺🇸
Nithin Srivatsa	Nice how he starts off as relatable and funny and then starts crapping about increasing the minimum wage. Evil right wing uneducated hillbilly MIT said that minimum wage has proven time and again to decrease worker benefits and increase automation. Just see what happened with Amazon. They got scrapped a lot of benefits.
Aman	Man, I love him. I'm not from US but he is the best president I can think. I really miss him. Can't he re-run for seat?☺️
callen	You consistent, sweet, genuine soul.. thank you for making my childhood ❤️
Kranken	God I wish he could of had a third term
Tim Carr	This worthless son of a bitch and his tranny bitch both need to be in jail.
rakantion	It's stupid to vote for someone just because they are a woman or they are gay
wandaroo	Love
Peter Thomas Ratto	Vote for someone that looks like you...okeh.
Steve Wyer	Voting is pointless.
Kevin Parkerson	"Remember those hearings where members of Congress were asking Mark Zuckerberg questions, like they've never used the internet before? It's because they haven't! Here's your chance to vote for people who actually know what the internet is" I died 🤣
Some Guy	Vote Red
Saud Mujahid	Obama you fucking warmongering scum. This mofo set the progressive a decade behind because of his greed
Spockitans	One thing I never liked about voting is that at the end of the day you're either voting Republican or Democrat. And by voting at all, you're basically subscribing to ALL the ideals of either party, when you yourself could be a centrist, or on the fence.  Anti-X, but Pro-Y? Sorry, but you're gonna have to pick one. You can't pick both.  And let's be honest, the likelihood of an independent being elected into office is so incredibly low, it may as well not be a choice.
jason Kingston	Here comes the Trumpsupporters.
Amarsanaa Otgonbaatar	This is how Presidents should be able to speak!
Narktapus	Even post-presidency he's spitting the truth and pulling hilarious one liners. Damn I miss Obama.
francis bonnafoy	ummmm we can't  call him a president anymore :I..:(
Chrome Hex	Why does it say President Obama, I don't think Presidents keep that title when they leave office.... Nothing against him, just pointing it out.
Tong Pa Fu	He doesn't care about Pokemon? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYuZlhCPbjM
Shane Hagan	coolest dude in the whole world
carlos martinez	Man I would love to have this man back in the presidency
james88	Whats up with that Ear
randomperson8571	OK this is going to sound callous but the only thing I can keep thinking throughout this video is "wow Obama's growing a mole on his nose." But anyway, yes, thank goodness he is all right.   Midterms are SO IMPORTANT, go vote!!! Do your research! CHANGE THE COUNTRY! This election doesn't have the electoral college! (This is coming from a 20-something millennial! Go vote!)   Best line in this video: "You remember those hearings where members of Congress were asking Mark Zuckerberg questions like they'd never used the internet before? That's because they haven't." YOU ROAST THEM OBAMA. YOU. ROAST. THEM.
pernus	Fun, but please don't be condescending to young people. That only turns them off more.
Denzel Sugayan	I didn’t know Obama could be this shady
Grace Lamar	We miss you 💕
LL Lew	I listened to that just to hear his calm reassuring voice again 😊
Skatelove2008	I can't even finish the video. First you had Bush who was like a caveman. Then you had this very intelligent competent and somewhat humane person and now you have an illiterate, ignorant crazy person by the name Trump in office. The contrast is just so strong I'm being blinded.
Gomu Gum	I miss his great motivational speeches. He was truly a great leader.
Princess Luna	I'm not ever American but I love Obama he is one of the best world leaders in history! Thank you
HenHen	3:04 What about the people on mobile?  OBAMA CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE XD
Lerdong Odol	"That's because they haven't" I fuckin love him 😂😂
Waffles	It's so weird when Obama isn't stuttering
Dustin Gliko	Anyone who votes to perpetuate the twoparty system is a moron. Anyone who doesn't know their state's electoral delegates and votes is a moron. Most of the voters in the U.S.A. are morons electing Democrat and Republican "career politicians" who profit handsomely by using their power of office. Human see, human do.
Michael Ellis	Excuse Number 8: I'M TIRED OF VOTING FOR CANDIDATES WHO LIE TO ME, LIKE YOU DID, BARRY.
nfinitiduck	Now this is a President.
Lana Lana	I’m 14 and from England I’m only here bc I love Obama
chillleft	Wait... He buttoned up for the interview only to take it back down the second it was done. He should have left it down, that's how we like it ✌
Ja'Brea Bennett	Your skin if flawless! We miss you! And I feel Like these lyrics are for you: "My castle crumbled over night,  I brought a knife to a gun fight, they took the crown but it's all right... All the liars are calling me one, Nobody's heard from me for months... I'm doing better than I ever was..."
Legion of Weirdos	So... if I voted for Dancing with the Stars FROM Coachella...?
Ken Walter	And don't wait until November 8th like some Republicans are telling people.
EnchantedPrincess11	I MISS THIS MAN AND HAVING A DAMN DECENT PRESIDENT!
Dalton Todd	Vote red!
mister johnson	this degernate wants illegals to vote because illegals are easy to pander to and always vote blue.
..vol... tron??	obama is such an awesome man I just want to have a pizza with him c':
Danny Thibodeaux	Mistake. This isn't President Obama, this is Former President Obama.
fenhen	Doesn’t care about Pokémon? Lost my vote
jacotorre_17 custom cars.	I just don't vote because my belief in that god and his son jesus are the all mighty rulers, and i was just watching a video on that mark zucerburgh thing lol.
Michael Ryan	I didn't even watch the video but will someone please just tell me why on earth you would want uneducated people to vote? If you don't care about politics then don't vote! If you have researched all sides of the arguments and want to vote then you should vote! Why would anyone want people to blindly throw a dart on issues in politics?????
Eli Fulop	First of all the title is wrong. Also tell Obama to just stop. We where lucky to survive his eight years. These leftists won’t stop. The leftists make it harder for middle class Americans, So vote for republicans
P A	Obama, you’ve already proven during your 2 term what you can do for the Americans. Your time is up. We need a president who actually keeps promises like President Trump, who actually put the citizens, innocent taxpayers and business owners who keeps the economy afloat first, and not foreigners (some of which may be criminals/terrorists) who come in to leech off of innocent taxpayers’ dollars. For those of you who support letting it illegal immigrants, well you deserve to be deported to the countries which they come from.
Cadillac Josh	I salute you Mr. Obama! 💯
Drew Bognaes	I miss his voice and his passion and what he stood for. I get emotional every time I see him in videos, I can’t help but compare his 2 terms to the shit show that is currently rampaging. Miss you man ❤️
3Mythical Dollies	i miss obama so much. i love him 😢
Rachel White	I love how much the rest of the world loves Obama, I see so many comments like “I’m not in America, but it’s Obama”. I can’t even vote, but I watched this for Obama. #StillMyPresidentInMyHeart
Burma RefleX	I  Think there's  smth wrong cuz Obama isn't president any more so u should call Former - president or smth else ...
The Foxes	I miss having a president who has a sense of humor...      Shoot joke is already taken 😪
Ivonne	Lol he threw shade at the congressmen 😂 internet
Hivlik	I love obama but this video sucks
Andrew Park	Obama is like the cool uncle that helps you out and Trump is like they kid who sets ants on fire with a magnifying glass
Amatreon	I don't agree with some of Obama's policies, but goddamn if he wasn't the coolest president in recent history
Jennifer Buckley	lol he's using a teleprompter
Ian O'Brien	Damn Obama doesn’t care that people Pokémon Go To The Polls 😂
Liam Fiddes	I miss you Obama. Such a PILF. (President I'd like to fuck)
ralixfilm	really refreshing to hear to somebody intellegient

SheistyProductions	I miss you, Obama!!!
Lolis or Riot	wtf more women running, and LGBT people running? What the actual fuck no. just no plz no. trump 2020 all the way fuck all this PC bullshit
Kristof's Konnection	*Former president, Obama
James Bellefontaine	Dick move attacking the older vote
Tyler Campbell	Former president*
TheFaze	People hate Obama for bullshit political or race reasons. So he's not George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. A president is a leader and a speaker and Obama is the best president, leader, speaker, and regular kinda guy we've seen in decades and is the Chillest President Ever.
Panthir 67	Wish he could run a 3rd time
Greg Hodges	Holy smokes sir, you've aged!
Ifeanyichukwu Nwaneri	He looks fresher and better.
Sutton M	Aw I miss himmmmmmmmmmmmmm
omeganik	lol president obama not former president i wish it was still 2016
Cody Reynolds	This was actually super helpful!
assa478 aladeen	Only if he actually did something in his last 6 years.
Serabi	Im not gonna be eligible to vote till next year but even if i could Obama would prefer me NOT to vote.  Im a center left person who believes in the right to self preservation, the right to free speech and im pro life for 99% of abortions (excluding rapes). I would be the person who Obama would HATE to see voting.
Moo Moo	I miss you man ❤️
J D	Hello fellow kids
Chen Yang Sia	his eyebrows are suspiciously not grey
Little Pussy	Obama look more white than black.....
Archie Mac	Why are you calling him president barrack Obama. He ain't president no more
D. N.	You mean, the chaos emeralds?
Andrew Blewski	You know what's boring? Listening to the same old Liberal talking points again and again. I'd prefer not to vote for someone who supports murdering un-born human beings, can't control our borders, believes in freedom from speech, believes there are some magical laws in place that prevent women from earning as much as men...I mean, I can go on all day xD
Aniel	I'm gay
John Lewis	Thanks Obama
Nathan Remix	Huh he still alive . Didn't hear a word from him since Trump came in .
Hurbii	if someone says they don't care about politics, then what would they want politicians to do?
Bear studios	The fact that I know more about US politics than most US citizens would be funny if it didn't hurt so much.
Nicolas Bajwa	How about I was forced to vote between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Fuck that.
Flynn Rider	The title says President, not former President, which is cool btw
Harrison Krank	Why are his teeth blue
oasdfe	He ain't president
Czakhareina Reyes	The way he tried to surpressed his laughter about the zuckerberg at senate moment... I so can relate.
Neobro 234	Not even American   Still watched and liked
Liz	*um he's not president anymore*
Ellis Nutt	TRUMP 2020!! POINT OF VIDEO IS TO GET YOU TO VOTE REPUBLICAN!!
Db Cooper	As a non-American, I must say your vote is the most important in the planet period.
Cob Baldridge	Thanks Obama. I'll vote for Trump
Ɓʟίƫɀ	Im highh rite n now
kortexsirvasil	People don't vote because you betrayed their trust and all the hopes they put into you in 2008 - and showed them that in the end what they get has nothing to do with what they voted for. So fuck off, Barry.
Red Thunder	Obama can talk like a President, gotta respect that. But don't think he was a perfect, honest, 100% clean president during his presidency. This man lied to and manipulated his supporters just like Trump
ThatOneRandomFlyingPig :/	A playlist is different then a political candidate....... just saying ✋🤨🤚
Jack Hansen	It would be ironic if there was a red wave
Benedicta Valentina	He forgot to mention HEALTH that's worth more than ANYTHING!!! 😤
Flat Pluto society	Obama does not support Bing or Yahoo confirmed
Juice Goose	i LOVE the way the title called him President Obama
drcoolisme	but you can't trust everything on google..

Samuel Clark	I didn't like most of his policies, but Obama was a really nice person. (which is more than what can be said about modern politicians)
Blitzkrieg PopBop	excuse me whatttttt? he isn't president anymore....
Richter Sokea	Like I would vote, but here’s the thing. I’m too young to vote.
Bizarro Number 1 Bizarro Number 1	YAWN! You did NOTHING for 8 years when YOU had all 3 branches of government.
Shabbii	Mr Obama I very much disagree and am upset. I feel personally attacked. What a terrible horrible person you are for not caring about pokemon.
T1tusCr0w	Obama is half reason for Trump and the DNC is the other half..
Jolly Mangina	I think he was talking about boring cunts not LGBT representation
Eric F	*former president 😂
Rando	Yes vote Republican
ViktorNotRussian	I got a good excuse: im not American.
157C	“Former” though I do miss him
Christian H	Only clicked this to say, he isn’t the president anymore. You can say “former president obama” or just “Barack Obama” or “Mr. Obama”
Ruben Vela	Soooo I was sent a ballot to my house during the last general election. I assumed I was going to get another ballot here at my house for this election but I didn’t. I looked into it and they said I wasn’t registered to vote and that now it’s too late to register. Sounds like voter suppression to me but hey what do I know...
annisam	**alexa, play i miss you by hannah montana**
ladistar	This guy was a radical communist who gave our country to illegals and Muslims.
Beth Marie	The seven reasons I do not vote.  1. My vote will not make the changes I want to happen.  2. The president in all reality is but the face of congress. :)  3. The president I pick may not be or stand for what they claim.  4. I do not want to be disappointed if they fail.  5. I do not agree with the political system that is in place.  6. I wasn't put on the earth to vote.  7. Life is too short to be political in a world that has to change in it's own time.  The damage this country has faced didn't happen over night, so it would take what was put into it to get it turned back around. It would be foolish for me to believe that the next president can cure all of the problems just like that.
aurora felicity	Ah, I love this man.
Melvin Sewell	You fucked this country up bro
Matthew Karchaske	*former president
Charbel Jalkh	He was president for 8 years why didn’t do that??
Dumbledore The Swaggy	Why didn’t that pipe bomb explode god
Lilith Steve	But I don't take advice from democrats...  XD
Mass Debater	you ain't the president now stop waffling politics is irrelevant why should I waste my day for something that I couldn't give a hoot about
Peter de Frankrijker	I miss this dude. And I’m a Dutchman living in The Netherlands, so effectively I have nothing whatsoever to do with him. I still miss him. The world was a little better when he was in the OO.
offset byte	"former"
Khalid Habib	He's great
Jaison McQuade	As someone who has lived in 7 countries and frequently travels between 12 others, America, please vote, and be informed when you do. Stop being the punchline to every international joke.
Pierzing.glint1sh7	loool I love how no one cares that it says ''President'' obama - when he's been retired for nearly 2 years
I like what i like	Noble Price Murder
Coop Shanks	This video summed up. Always vote democratic and ignore every other party because they are wrong.   Where is Trump’s counter tweet?   The reason voter turn out is dropping is because Americans are starting to see money buys change, not votes. Let’s hope our Disney and Google Lizard Lords take care of us in the future.   The fact that Disney and Fox are merging is great tbh. Can’t wait to see who they recast as wolverine. I’ll find time to see that movie.   Kappa
Manipulate Media	hi obama what did you do?
Allen A	He's not the president you fucking libtarded shit
Triveni Baishya	I miss the Old America
Richard Ellis	Any chance Obama could be our prime minister???
Vicki Bee	I CAN'T vote in anyone better but I vote anyway. They put me on a capital cases trial because I voted in the past. I'm not going to NOT vote after being called for jury duty in a capital murder.
Gabriel Küsel	Ah but I don't want minimum wage to be raised.
THE ALPHA Bro	Obama dosnt like Pokémon.right were did I put my MAGA HAT.....
Mark Goulden	But... he is no longer President during this interview. The title should be Former President. These titles are just pure pandering.
Olivia Porter	Thank you Mr. President  -A lazy teenager that wasn’t planning on voting

m0d3l500	"President Obama Doesn't Have Time For These 7 Excuses Not To Vote" 1) FORMER President Obama. 2) sure he has no time - he has to give all those 1mio Dollar speeches to his real owners that were pulling his strings while in WH.
Lynn Sanders	I miss President Obama too.  His positive energy, compassion and integrity stand out.
Dry & Bitter	He’s not the president you know.
Eddy O.	I miss him too! I just don't understand how the MORON we have in office now get's away with 1/2 of the crap he does. If we were to act like him at our job or work place we would all be out of work! And QUICK!!!
Jess	I didn't know the context of the whole Pokemon thing but he's got a point so I forgive him.
Kroeser me	I love him so damn much
Gigaman	Please come back... We miss you Obama
Elliot Casson	I like how the title says "President" even though, you know, he's not president. I get it, though. Let's make believe he's still here if it helps us.
Vytautas Va	This comment section: Liberals
Dee Cookie	I like him. Down to earth.
TheThisguy1983	Uh oh...encouraging people to participate and vote = "Liberal Snowflake Bias."
Envy West	Obama is great. We know. But can we have a minute of appreciation to the writer of this scrips👏👏👏
Shitty Ceo	Ex

Mighty Marouane Fellaini	Don’t you mean. Former president.
juses	why are you calling him president obama? he isn't the president
MrTehRave	Wow I wonder who this is aimed at. Look at those jump cuts, chill hop, memes, a monstrous amount of social media and pop culture references. Lowkey lefty propaganda
Berna Dogan	I´m not American but TO ALL AMERICANS PLEASE VOTE
NPC 38366739002	Brown president good, orange president bad #BelieveAllWomen
Kaz Pen	Excuse 8 - They are all corrupt and don't care about the "people" - they only care about how much power they can get.  Excuse 9 - All I hear when a politician opens their mouth is Blah Blah Blah - all talk and no action - except for lining their own pockets.   Excuse 10 - All politicians are two faced, lying toe rags who cannot be trusted to do what they say they are going to do when they are begging for your vote.  In fact, they do the exact opposite once they get into power!  Until they are legally bound to do what they say they are going to do in their manifesto - there is no point in voting for any of them. We need something completely new!!
OneHumanity OnePlanet	Everybody who didnt vote for the democrats must be Insane. No Health care System, No pregnant/mother vacation. Private Prisons. Insane!  #Greetings from Europe
Fjedew	I am not from the US, but Obama is and always will be MY President

Nidge Morphie	Vote obama so that he can bring whistle blowers to justice and keep them quite.
Yellow.	President Obamaaaaa 😭😭😩😫 we miss u, please come back. Save us from the orange idiot.
sivan rottelman	President Obama? Last time I checked trump was the president 😂
Keln	Please run again in 2020 x')
jacx x	Obama Vs trump.... sorry I asked the question!
pteeng1	This guy is no longer a president and his words will go unheeded. Social inequality has been part and parcel of the history of the USA. The fact that Congress vetoed free national health for everyone is stark proof that money is more important than values unless those values are 1. Freedom of choice, that is the choice to make money; 2. Land of the free, that is of free enterprise. The rest is a total lie that Americans have been living since...erm...1776. Get over it, in a land where racism and discrimination are the very foundations of its constitution things are truly fucked up. A vote means jack shit. Look at history: Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Trump. The world is truly fucked up.
MaxDeveloper	The shittiest president ever.
Cindy Graham	I feel 40% better after watching this video.  It’s been feeling a bit hopeless, have to remember where there is a Donald trump, there is also a Barack Obama.
Stefan Danev	you brought the country to shambles
Tony Markic	Yikes these comments

And Peggy Jansen	My excuse to vote wasn’t here. It’s cause I’m Finnish and underage.
Shooting Star	watched this and now im definitely going to vote... for the GOP !!! thanks obama
panzermacht	Wait, he thinks that people complaining that there aren't politicians they identity with means there aren't enough young/LGBT/brown/women politicians?  Am I the only one who cares about the thoughts and ideas of candidates or am I missing something?
Jeff Jeff	Why Pokémon what did it do to him😖😖😖😣😣
Jace Joseph	When Obama says shut the fuck up and vote, you *shut the fuck up and vote*
internet champ	Subject: RE: Get ready for "Chicago Hot Dog Friday" I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?
JO	Pokemon 😂
Hugh Janus	Barrack Obama*
c A freed	very very stupid man became President by lie . democrat mafia  Hussei Albarak Al Obama . Terroristes supporter . he destoied USA and crated the groups Islamic all around the world . he will be in human history as a stupid President
Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond	Comes across very well & reads the script perfectly.
Thegoldenemerald	The title is technically wrong
Ben Davolls	How about vote weighing? A couple of Mandatory questions at the top to see how informed the voter is, then depending on the score, your vote is weighed. Ignorant? score 1. Knowledgeable about the current state of the country? score 2. Highest score wins
Chicken Chaser 125cc	I thought that your vote does not matter because how the votes are counted?
Ansai Ricciardi	Who cares if your a democrat or a republican, don’t let politics divide each other.
Nepharius TV	He will always be my president. He’s so cool and he actually cares about us as human beings and wants to unite us as a country. God i miss him.
Ababmer Vid	Trump: 4.2% GDP, Lowest Unemployment Rate in a Decade. Obama: Nothing.
Oh Damn	HE👏ISNT👏PRESIDENT
shamik chakraborty	can't wait to see this blow up in the face of Democrats. Democrats want more voter participation. What if More and more voters vote Republican ?

Keita Foxy	Lol for excuse number 2 he’s basically saying ANYONE you vote for would do and it would be better than ending up with D.T. administration in the office again.
Raiden	I still  love him.
Rachel El	I feel like he was the president 8 million years ago. GAHHHHHH 😭
AidenGH23	Well I honestly don't care about America...
Dáin Ironfoot	Holy fuck he looks old.
Bija Abba	I'm a teen and I enjoyed politics especially when he was president. Trump has been so discouraging in many ways but it has actually encouraged me more to vote when i'm old enough because i understand my vote does matter. Even tho idk much about the actually people running always. I enjoy looking at the basics cause that's how everything starts.
Nathalie C	that " there ´s no joke here" is just fantastic. Ok american people, the entire world laughs at you because of Trump ... but you still have Obama. You still the state that elected the coolest president on earth.
Daniel Knapp	I laugh at Trump because i think he is dumb, i laugh at Obama bacuase i think he's kinda funny. One these things is better than the other.

James Bledsoe	I MISS OBAMA
A   Angela	Even in Germany we miss the Obama's and can still not believe what kind of president US people voted for, at the last election.  #8 Your vote has an impact to the entire world!
Ditiro Motene	Obama looks less stressed 😹
knightingale	3:03 FTW!

Stephen Butler	If American midterms are anything like uk local elections, then they matter more than the general elections.
Emperor Dank	Obama seems to get older everytime he's on camera
Amber Spath	Pokemon Go To The Polls!
Estefan Richter	Thanks Obama!~
Keyshell	I would love to see Trump do something like this. Just to see the colossal difference in charisma.
Bob dude	Trump is better
Ben Cummings	No thanks, I'm apolitical. Doesn't effect me.
Jason Mason	I’m Australian and it’s illegal not to vote
30secondstomarsMBH	As much as I love him, his answer for "I Don't Care about Politics" was crap.  They don't care. They don't even care enough to want someone out or to care enough to check out the other options.   The BETTER answer is this:  Just because you don't care, doesn't mean politics doesn't affect you. The price of gasoline, the ability to move freely from state to state, country to country, the way you use your internet, politics affects everything that happens in your life. Everything.   It's great saying you don't care, but you care about your life. If you care about how your life works and what you want in life, you might want to start checking back in to politics, because that's a sure-fire way of improving your life choices, if you vote in the right person for you.
roadhouse699	I'm very passionate about protecting the 2nd Amendment and comprehensive military spending based on the needs of the military rather than the desires of politicians who know nothing about it, but I'm also very passionate about non-heterosexuals receiving all the same rights as heterosexuals, as well as slowing climate change as much as possible.  Is there a single politician left in the entire United States who represents my views?
Dapple Dog	The amount of sheepish ignorance within these comments is amazing. #MAGA 2020
Kyle Parkins	I can’t vote; I’m too young and I don’t live in America.
Austin Hernandez	I just hate that two only two options really are Democrat and Republican. Primary elections should be abolished to give more opportunity for members of third parties or better yet no party affiliations. I also can't stand the retarded, low IQ, indoctrinated, close minded voters that say they'll only vote for one party, judging everyone of an entire party. Just scroll down this comment section and you'll see waht I mean.
IAMTHEICEMAN	I may not have liked the guy policy-wise, but he's easily one of the funniest and most charismatic presidents to hold office.
Zach Frost	I think it's funny how most of what he says when telling you to vote sounds a lot like propaganda
Turkic	Fucking go away for God's sake
NBOd ds	The title should say *Former President* ur livin in fantasy land
Jacqueline Bucovy	OMIGOD I MISS HIM SM!!!!!!!!
Catie lady	TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT NOT HIM!!!
Emma Yu	All The Right SHADE In All The Right Places！！！dad the babysitter is bullying US
Whistling Whistler	He knows that the younger generation is more liberal, and left wing in nature, hence him encouraging young people to vote.  Naughty Obama... need a lil slap for that
We Deserve Better	Sorry Obama but you are part of the reason why people became disenfranchised in the first place.
Neptune Rider	Obama you convinced me to vote  REPUBLICAN
Alex D	Not sure why it's "President Obama" he's not the president anymore

Bomber Harris Do It Again	#1: a bomb was sent to your house
Fiona Cahalan	It's 2018. Former President Obama. Former.
Ashanti Robinson	Where is his ring?!
Alexander Stromer	How about this one: Most of the candidates are crap and the one's which would be the right choice are far from popular and will never make it anyway. Instead we constantly get mass market rules and people pleasers. Ergo democracy as is, is flawed
Vault Boy	But he’s not a president
Bre ME	I wish Trump was Trump but with Obamas personality
konakona	The problem is that people do NOT want you to vote. They want you to vote for their party (or one of the parties they think is ok). Btw. I'm not from the USA, so can't talk about Reps/Dems. There is no party I want to vote for where I live (Germany) and the issue I described really frustrates me
Ibrahim Abdel-Haleem	And now I wonder how the American people elected Trump
Automotive Anatomy	Vote for Biden to run for president and Obama as VP for 2020.
Hyper Nova	He's not the ducking president
NTM	I get to known more about America when he was president , and I find it cool .... if it was today HELL NO

Will Eden	Fraud.
Steven O' Brien	Bought by Wall Street
Flav	MY PRESIDENT!
Jack De Vida	Man he looks old. My uncle is a year older than Obama and he doesn't look this weathered. Still miss this guy tho.
Inni Khan	I don't live in america so can someone please tell me what this election is for?
ice cloud	Dont you mean "former president" he needs to fucking go away.  He is so washed up, it is quite obvious he doesnt care about the united states or its citizens, he is just trying to get people to vote democrat so they can keep scamming people..
Harry Pearson	He's not the president
Douglas  Hamandishe	I totally agree - reasons to vote are universal check it out https://youtu.be/o6QPBXkFHEg
Lebby Great	Orange Man Bad, Democrats good.  /s

FluXXed	Shouldn't it say *FORMER* president lmao
Godd Howard	*Mr.Obama or Senator Obama not President Obama, the current POTUS is Donald Trump and after his term he will be Mr.Trump
thomas vansteelant	Giving me House of cards vibes
Horizonts	Why is obama advertising elections, shouldn't trump be doing that?
WateverWatever04	I love how much shade he's throwing 😂
Shibli Ziadeh	If my vote really matters, then explain the Al Gore / little Georgie presidential outcome. I don't believe in the system period. I bet you, that you cannot point your finger at any politician including yourself, that came into public office to serve us (The Employer) with empty pockets and left with empty pockets. How much are you worth right now Mr. President?. How come we don't have the same health insurance that you and all of the government (Our Employees)have?. So, Please spare me the bullshit, that my vote counts. All we do in this country is, every election we have to choose who is going to fuck us the least with the red, white and blue dildo, and the choice between plastic or paper bags. I will end my comment using the bullshit line that all politicians uses GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA, lifeless slogan, lifeless politicians. Good luck America.
Mr H9736	I want tomorrows headlines to read Obama infers that Dancing With The Stars is rigged. We all know those bullshit talent shows are. Time to bring and end to them.
Vaskor Basak	Whoever uploaded this video seems completely out of touch with events - the title should be 'Former President Obama...' rather than 'President Obama' (although I'd probably be much happier if he was still President).
samuel fitzpatrick	Mr Obama is the best
hugo h	I miss him, heck I miss Bush!  At least Bush would make me laugh
Paul Gibbons	The whitest black American they may ever elect.
Anthony Olmo	Why isn’t voting day a national holiday?
Dustin Townsend	No candidate wants unequal pay for women. If a woman works the same job, with the same amount of hours as me, she will make the same. Period. If you start paying women more, then and only then, you will have unequal pay.
Mysterious	it's not president Obama it's just Obama
Akshita _	The irony is they're still addressing him as President Obama. 😂 Everyone hates the orange Cheetos.
Richard Ugwu	"Scrolling through endless photos of your dinner on Instagram"😂😂
James Lane	I disagree with him on so many things politically but damn i miss his optimism and candor.
ok skeleton	Ex-president
Kris Papa	Democrats are trying so hard ... can u please finally get lost
Cornflakes And Milk	He's not the president no more, just...Obama.
Chris Lagos	President Obama is a sellout.  I will vote, having said that,  His just vote premise , presupposes that there will be a name on the list that will move us into a brighter future than the present. He was instrumental in the  bought and paid for results of the 2016 primary election.  Harry Truman once said that if you leave public service richer than when you came in, you're a crook. By that measure alone, president Obama is a crook, setting aside the fact that the long held Republican pipe dream of a health care mandate is now the dnc flagship, The fact that he brought more fracking in the United states and overseas to countries that didn't want it than ever before. The man is a disgusting sellout in my view. Yes, he's eloquent , so what's the point if we're sold out.
ansh garg	He’s good.
CarrotShaker	omfg i literally cant even with him, he talks about other people being uninformed when literally so much of america PRAISES obama for doing absolutely nothing, even in his presidency he was useless.
C P	*Former President
Jasmine Alize Plata	You will ALWAYS be my president! I love and miss you and your family so much, and I will never forget all you have done for us in those magnificent years.

Amanda N	Bring Obama back..... please!!!!!
Perry Dubreuil	Cool guy .Can make anything sound exciting .Us Canadians love him
Aj Tamburino	I’m republican but Obama is the coolest president ever regardless of policy and biases in this video
nobody you know	if no one else will say it, i will, he has not been president of the united states for TWO YEARS.
george h	Obama was the best president and honestly sometimes I think he is still the acting president. The only thing I want to know is, does he dye his eyebrows, because they are great.
zachary nachin	Lmfao... When obama said that the 1% GDP was the new age. That how is trump going to make these deals and make America great again?? What magic wand does he have??? Now you look at it... He's taking credit for trumps economy. When he made deals in other nations to keep companies there.... Fucking funny... Told all you liberal fascist that the new GDP was only going to be 1%. When the GDP has moved to 4.5%.... And yet he's the greatest President? Nd trump is a joke? But I bet half, You liberal fucks are benefiting from Trumps economy with his magic wand that Obama said that he didn't have....
That’s The Badger YT	What if I live in England?
Gunmetal Grey	I can't wait to for trump 2020!
Joseph Doty	why vote when it doesn't matter. Our vote goes somewhere then someone just does whatever they want. take for example the electoral college. Its a load of crap. Another example is MA with there recreational marijuana vote that passed in 2016 and nothing happened. I'm tired of me voice being worthless because of how this insane bureaucracy of bullshit works.
Nick Hilliard	Former President Obama*
Can I get 500 subsribers with no videos?	0:16 “I don’t care about Pokémon”. SO I GUESS OBAMACARE WAS JUST A MYTH, HUH?
Chick Magnet	propaganda
Sukh Mykoc	"Is there any kind of introduction or are we just plunging in that huge asshole." What?
Yonny Chavez	Lol that's first comment about Pokemon😂. Okay he's convinced me.
Katrina S	That was not a like a president
HappyOnLifeCuzBeans	As an outsider looking in at American politics, I don't have a dog in the fight. I do find it weird however, that race relations in the US took a massive step backward during the tenure of their first black president.
Diddyguy24	How about instead of complaining we all accept that Donald Trump is our president for at least the next 2 years. I don't really like him that much either but I'm not going to cry about it.
mhffc	Could one be " I don't want to vote for a President who authorises the execution of a wanted suspect on foreign sovereign territory" or " A President who escalates the use of drone strikes and in doing so kills more innocent civilians ..
Platinum Pineapple	OBAMA 👍😍
Arnav Dinesh Kamath	Here's an 8th reason. I'm a minor
Ceebo Vid	I remember when 90% of comments were smack talk when he was president but with the perspective of trump lets reminisce the good ol'bama days. Just an observation, I see sheep.
Avengers Newbie	I know nothing about USA but I do know Obama was way better than Trump.
Nathan's Channel	You know he's not president Obama anymore
Jay	I love this man.
Zawjat Mansoor	We Want Obama Back!
J. Sanchez	Damn Barack shots fired at my Instagram feed *pew*pew*
eiecheverri2	I love you.
KleenerBro	Holy crap how distorted can someone be to actually think Trump is better in anything than Obama? He even beats him in Whiteness if that makes any sense.
user name	Lol, still calling obama president
Banks	Obama still doesn't get it. People are struggling, they don't give a damn about sexual orientation or where you fought in uniform. It's about policy, policies that make sure people can work full-time and not need to rely on welfare or food banks to survive. P.S. many rich/wealthy people don't vote, all they do is donate thousands and politicians like Obama do exactly what they say.
xXFeralArtsXx	Obama can shut the fuck up this manipulative lying SOB. His opinion is irrelevant, his word untrustworthy. Man's going around saying how cool he is, meanwhile deaths in black communities and general gang violence had tripled under his great leadership. Fooken Trump is doing more good to black folk than this piece of shit.
Klaus O'Shaunacey	“You wouldn’t let your grandparents pick your playlist...” hey my grandma gets some banging songs going
Henry Ijeoma	*"...and climate change is a hoax"* Ooooooooooh burnnnn!!
MrGamerman001	I like obama, always have. But I think this is the first time I've disagreed with him. Voting does NOT work. An entire state could vote blue, but if the delegates vote red then the state is going red. This is why we should only base elections on popular vote.
edwin mason	This guy is the best - why ever did the American idiots vote for Trump?
Ken Hewson	Go pick cotton
John Taylor	What's wrong with Pokemon?
Alexis Halliwill	He’s the one that needs to come back!
Sara Gold	What a nut case...
Daz69H	The UK is so pleased you got rid of this puppet and replaced him with a real president. Trump for a second term please.

sheck pez	Here 2 dislike
rhukie k	As a Brit, it's nice to be reminded that not every American voted a chimpanzee into the Whitehouse.
roblex63	Shouldn't you be out there helping starving kids or something ? instead of doing this shit...
AlyssaIsBored	thATS BECAUSE THEY HAVENT HAHA i love obama
robot6644	Number 2 is actually kind of sexist and racist. You are assuming that because someone is the same race or gender as I am that I have to vote for them or that I relate to them. You are a black man who grew up rich. You have little in common with a massive chunk of "your kind" who have had none of the pleasures you've enjoyed since birth. Definitely was a terrible choice for this video.
photo Kemp	He is as evil as Hilary
- -	Well he does have time since he made this video...
Harrie Healey	Lol Obama sucks, trump is da man😎👌🇬🇧
Delaney Shaw	Didn’t know this joke was still President.
JamaicanRain	LOL at the "no time".  Obama acts as if he's never been busy.  He should try being a parent sometime.  You're taking care of your infant in 2010 and suddenly it's 2040 3 kids a life later and time's flown by and you realize then you haven't voted in decades because of busyness and you STILL can't vote!
Johnny Dickshot	He's no longer a president.
john phillips	Eternity is to long to get this wrong. Accept Jesus Christ today, we are not promised a tomorrow. It is a free gift, take it. Do yourselves a favour and check out these channels, Truth Happens and ODD Reality.
IronPeter	whats orientation got to do with the person you vote for.
RatherA	What's his exuse for destabilizing two countries? He ordered to bombard Libya and kill their leader and ordered to arm rebels in Syria? So what's his excuse?
Mora Ognian	i miss you
Kian Irajy	you fucked us over, Bush did too, and so has Trump. But I send you my love and respect from IRAN, for sending us Nowruz Messages (however symbolic they were). Long live the Islamic Republic of Iran, and may God finally bless America.

Chris Kayser	Wow, he really became old
Tom Butcher	3 reasons I like watching Obama give speeches 1.) He can actually speak intelligently 2.) Obama is a funny 3.) I like reading all the pissed off replublican or trumptards ranting and raving.
Icantchangemynamefor90days -	Raise the voting age to 21
Marcus Thorén	Even if every president of the US is a muppet of other elites, this man surely made politics in the US feel real and relatable. His voice is so soothing too. We miss you, Obama.
M E Hendrix	The only reason I’m not voting is I literally can’t. I’m not old enough. And my state isn’t participating in the midterms.

Jamie Dabber	‘President’
Ben Ward	Nice guy but a fucking useless president!
Quinn Orleans	Fun fact: Obama [and every other former U.S President] is currently on a pension of $200,000+ annually - excluding additional finance such as free travel and postage which can raise this amount to over $500,000 annually  Moral of the story: Screw 9-5, just become the U.S president and work for 8 years tops ;)
Hashim ThaDream	I miss this man so much!

Adam	Glad he's not the POTUS anymore XD
Vamsi Krishna	He is such a great orator..True LEGEND...

*YellowMan In Africa*	This not Obama. LOL
John Howard	Worst. POTUS. Ever.
Jeanne Jaurès	Obama groupies are so blinded by their love that they don't see this guy, beside his little jokes and "cool attitude", was just a terrible president.

de wolff	Go home
10 10	Still ain't voting
Lynchy The Classical Liberal	Thank god he had is arse kicked by Trump in 2016.  Obama has plenty of nice talk, but never got anything done.
Joren van der Ark 5	If 100 percent of american citizens voted we could get a representative government, well that and throw out first past the vote.
BattleCarrot	Benghazi Operation Fast and Furious IRS Scandal Using executive orders to steal power from congress when they wouldn't get his laws through Iran deal  These are just 5 of the many things Obama did terribly wrong. Maybe check them out before worshiping him.
Andy The Wookie	Shut up Obama you did nothing but make the problem worse increased our debt, got more people on welfare, fucked healthcare.
Mr Patraeus	Death to this tit. Globalist bastard
Oot spagoot	Good guy, horrible president.
JinXPrince	What did Obama actually do for America?
Travis Rabble	A useless puppet of a President, an absolute embarrassment of a President. You might as well have put a sponge in charge as it would have absorbed more than this idiot. Regards
rocker4577	What about, its a total sham and a lie and he's one of the greatest deceivers of all? Answer that.
Miguel M	I don't know why but this doesn't feel cringey to me and I know it should, so great work makers ( and Mr Obama ) keep it up
Vincent Campaert	Classic leftist propaganda
Gian Santos	1:54 Student loans is one of the leading causes of early in debt. Why tf would you want it easier to access. So you can get the young people of America back on depending on you? No. Awaken little sheep and shake off the chains the Democrats have tied on us and vote right. #MAGA (I am aware of certain policies the republicans have made, but essentially it doesn’t even matter really if you’re a transgender from a male to female, just mark female. Or if you’re really unhappy with that, then start a petition and they’ll change it. But whatever you do, don’t vote left. Unless of course, you want the destruction of this country in around a year, because that criminal George Soros wants only the end of our sacred United States.
JY Assistant	Who is this old man and why is he teaching us about google?
This Rebel is Scum	Everyone should vote, because if you don't vote you can't complain if your government is made up of morons.
Leo Bullock	Oh how short people's memories are......  He was another war monger who lied and lied and lied......  Just like Trump just like Bush just like Clinton just like Bush Sr and so on and on and on and on  And yet look at all the love for him lmao......  You people are fools
Steve	Obozo - you're fired. This fake black guy has done more damage to the U.S. than all presidents combined.
Rik Hughes	I've never liked this man, I find him a false puppet. Sure he's good looking, suave, perhaps even sophisticated but he does not deliver. I do not like Trump as a man, I find him slightly un-couth, but he does what he say's he's going to do. If someone does not do as he/she is told he sacks them, how refreshing! Trump is a politician who actually delivers his campMillions of people voted for Trump and they are justified in their choice. If you want mediocrity bring back Obama...……… if you want change for the people Keep Trump.
esketeet scots	"President"
Akshath Manikandan	One of the best presidents in American history, who helped America fight the recession and saved the country’s automobile industry.  I wish all that was possible in the current circumstances....I agree on some issues of immigration with Trump though... but kudos Obama!
MJ H	It`s sad to see that other countries have the same problems with Non-Voters as here in Germany... I wish that our former chancellors would do things like this. (and would have  humor like this. Mostly our politicians are boring...)
sol walker	The easiest way to make your student loans affordable is to be born in a country other than the US seriously why do you guys pay so much? It's capped at £3k a yr here
Loch #1	A Good Man if there ever was one.
Ching Chong	Say all you want, obama was a chill mothafucka. I would want him to narrate my shitty life lol
Punkster	Democrats are in such a mess you give left-leaning people no one to vote for. Partisan loyalty is not a good enough reason. It is time to focus on the future and you cannot do that while you are still looking back at Obama. The Democrats need to be sorted out and sorted out fast.
renge99O9	Someone ask this dude if he will endorse Hillary Clinton for President in 2020.   Then you'll see some REAL shuck and jive.  :-D
David Love	Oh yeah this is what a capable President looks like! It’s been so long
a B	Globalist shill
DS YAMO	"thats changing this year." where have i heard that before, oh wait. i remember, your campaign. thanks obama
Alezey574	Keep it real Obama. Voting doesn't matter coz it is probably rigged
Kessler 2072	My excuse: I'm 15 and I have more political views than any adult I know.
Tommy Moore	He's not President anymore.
King man	Fuck obama for destroying libya!
Marmelademeister	I think this is a really important message. But maybe it would be time to change something about your election system. In Germany we are doing a lot of things differently, and I would argue: better. For example, elections take place only on Sundays. Also, there is a voter register for every electorate. Everyone in the voter register receives an election notification by mail like one month in advance, and the notification includes the address of the polling station.
Flavius Belisarius	If you are uninformed that's the perfect excuse not to vote.  What's to stop you from voting for someone who stands for the opposite of what you want
Agent SEPTEMBER	I want to express how much I miss this man, how much he is needed more than ever today and the good that he can do, but people are already saying what I'm thinking better than I could articulate. It's good to see people who know a good person when they see them.
TANKS	God I wish this man could be our permanent leader
Precious McNeil	He looks even better!!!! Miss you so much, Mr. President. Someone who carried themselves with dignity, but who also had a sense of humor. Now look what we have in the office, a joke.
MADK 27	Lol they don't call him former president it's like trump doesn't even exist 😂😂
Thomes Maisling	"Google is super easy to read" True unless you're reading about POLITICS. Then the results of your search are almost always a confusing mess of spin and and contradictory opinion. After all how can you get past the opinion to the truth, when spin and opinion seem is all that's available?
Archangel17	I never understood why the US elections are on a working day or why this day isn't at least some kind of national holiday on which people don't need to work.
Bebe AlRasheed	I'm not American but I miss Obama so much<3
Michael Parleblue	Anti American, none American, anti-white racist, bigoted radical islamist sympathizer. WORST PRESDENT EVER.
Adrian Blair	"Former President Obama" 😘
GashCam	Anyone with a brain wouldn't give a shit what this dick smoker thinks
MarxY	He makes America look sane again.
Greggybread	So the lying hack that is Obama has been pulled out to help the dems
Kane&chloe	He’s getting whiter 😂
FunkyAnimal The Earl of Funkdom	Obama is a great orator and charmer. He was a lackluster President. He did nothing to confront China's trade war with the US. Race relations deteriorated under his watch.
Gabi Ghita	At #2 when he was listing more representative candidates like women, LGBT, etc. I was so hoping he'd say atheists but I guess that one's still taboo. Still, it's always a breath of fresh air to see Mr. Obama. Reminds me of what normal should actually be.
Xrisus94	I dont like politiks.   Look i dont like pokemon. But that dosent stop it from coming back! - Obama.
Man.	Thanks Obama, I'm gonna vote all Republican! :D
Wikan Hastuningdyah Budiharto	those eyebrows tho'
vegoman	Glad he's out of office
Fabio Roberti	I can literally see his strings
Jack Dog	I’m not American, but this guy is so damn likeable and this current one is a dick.
KOROSH Babaei	Thanks a lot for sucking up to Iranian regime and giving them millions of dollars to crack down Iranian people and help Assad in Syria ,Hezbollah in Lebanon,Hotis in Yemen,Ghods forces in Iraq,terrorists in Bahrain  .You sided with  islamic dictatorship and wrote love letters to rootless ayatollah .You betrayed Iranian people and Americans,we hate you for that. You handed Iraq in a plate to the  islamic government of Iran for god sake. As once said ,by grate power comes a grate responsibility ! Thanks a lot for all that , haj Houssein Obama .
Zealot Wang	There are two interesting points from this video. First, democrats thinks that they are a party for young people. Getting young people go out to vote will benefit them. Second, more people go out to vote is a great indicator that a country's democracy and government  is becoming increasingly dysfunctional. Therefore people feel the urgency to vote. Trust me, more voter turnout means things are getting scary and polarized, more gridlocks in politics.
Gary Oldman	Why does it say President in the title? I understand that a lot of Americans are unhappy with Trump, but it's a bit weird still calling Obama the President. Makes me think ATTN: is a biased source and not worth subscribing to.
Sebastian Kristiansen	Good riddance you war mongering, bought and paid for, race baiting charlatan. Republicans will win again and again.
Danster82	If He was honest he would say the will of the people is not fullfilled in government so voter apathy is entirely understandable. We need to reform beyond representive governance to utilize technologies for more direct governance by the people without middlemen.
ldstof	*Former President
Minetoutong	People that does not care about politics should not vote.  It's a terrible idea to make them vote.
Caspar	The bias of YouTube is astonishing. This guy is a puppet & the same people who run YouTube. Have less influence on the way America is governed..... good!!
Alex Alone	I never understood it when people said Obama was a terrible president, I thought he was amazing, he represented everyone, he was easy going and kind and he truly cared which is so so rare in politics these days. It's just a shame it took Donald Trump for y'all to realise how great Obama was and get nostalgic for him
Mar Wth	Guess he can have gadgets now hahahah
david g	Do t worried fellow nocs I will be voting
Matt James	He's not the President
Da Illusionist	He is not black. 👻👻👻

Aditya Sharma	Wish we had a head of state like him
ΛDΛM	I love how brainwashed americans clearly are with how they're acting in the comments lol
Matt Lee	He ain't President anymore he's just Barack Hussein Obama now.  Go away and crawl back under your rock and let pres Trump sort out your mess. MAGA
Olympia.WA	I miss Obama. I’m not American but he represented world values better than most other presidents. The US I a huge country with a lot of influence. The decisions they make can help or hurt the rest of the world. Remember you’re not just a part of a state or a province or a country, you’re a citizen of the world. The things that happen in one country can affect us all. All votes matter. Make sure your values are represented.
Yeemø Katherine	I’m from the UK and even I miss him. He cared about his people and changed the way people view the world.
Mannez Mootseng	I'm not American but I so as hell would vote just cause Obama encourages voting!!
Hayloom Terence	He's such a sleazeball
Cheesie 65	I didn’t like Obama but we can all agree that people should vote
Reginald Wigglesbottom	My vote does not count. That is always a good one. On October 20,2018 in Peachland, British Columbia, Canada there was a municipal election. When the votes were counted the winner was won by 1 single vote. There was a recount done and it turned out that it was a tie. Your vote counts. You live in a free country, take advantage of that and exercise your right to vote. Many people in the world don't have that choice.
January Baby	Has my guy been dying his eyebrows?
Grodioz	I'm not even American and he convinced me to vote.
Stuart Houston	Who’s voting red with me?
Black Salami	Fuck having a tranny president no wayy Idc what you say

carol H	Listen
LupusGelos	FORMER president. Literally a has been
Hi Jack	Okay..not an American. But why will you hate on this guy?? He's the nicest guy I've ever seen
Pritam Sinha	EX-President.
Kyle Noe	He's still my President. Idk when tf they're gonna bring in the next one. I'm happy with the one I've got.
Joe White	"I'm not into politics" is a perfectly valid reason not to vote, why would we want someone who knows nothing about politics choosing who governs the country? Uneducated people voting is what put trump in power.
Dylan D Fleck	Voting is rigged in favor of the republicans. Just look at what’s going on in Georgia. Several thousand black votes apparently don’t count.
T ZJ	EX-president*
Chris chris	It's true all old people vote and they don't know shit about the modern world and look at the shit they have voted for in the past they made a right cunt of it choosing all the wrong people   over and over again the youth vote is the one that counts they aren't senile cx💜💜💜
kayincat	What do real leaders look like? Like him. Someone who encourages positive actions and who empowers you to strive to be the best version of yourself.
Tim	Please Mr. President, ask your daughters to run for President when they are old enough.  We need a Woman in the White House! And a FEMALE OBAMA would be extremely exciting and hopeful.  Obama for President again ( when they are old enough)
pilkerss	Young people in America need to VOTE! YOU CAN DO'S IT!
Leia Jiang	I have a great one, i am chinese and 16
Macario Patrick	All he did was repeat himself and told people to go vote.
Toni Pwneroni	LOL, silly yanks and their optional voting. Just make it mandatory like any normal representative democracy.
Andrew J	I can't vote. I'm Canadian. But I watched this entire video just to remember what it's like to hear a U.S. president form complete sentences.
Ed Mob	i don’t even live in america and i’m voting because of him
Elizabeth Hoover	SO refreshing!!! Amen to everything he said here. I am SO tired of people not voting and complaining about the state of things. No excuses, don't be a part of the problem. Thank you, President Obama.
King Liberal Mc’GayGlobalwarming	Half my friends use these bullshit excuses, and it’s sad because young people are the future on changing politics from grumpy, apathetic, and shitty old fuckmeisters to people who care about women, lgbt people, minorities, and getting universal healthcare.
Patrick F	Man, Youtube are shameless putting this on trending trying to effect the elections, while deleting thousands of Youtube channels for supposedly that very reason.
Chris Callear	What about big business funding both sides to make sure they get their policies through either way?
ross mcfadyen	7 excuses for the current presidency being so successful  7.trump  6.trump 5.trump  4.trump 3.trump  2.trump  1.usa
Sheikh Mohammad Adil	Hahaha....Obama called out those congressmen illiterate in Internet 😆😆😆😆 lolz best thing
EKEKEK88	Sure they’ll all vote for republicans
Skipper	He is such a matured smart and gentleman. On the other hand Trump is such an arrogant person.
Macobsession100	We’ll see Obama, we’ll see
SlimThrull	Regarding point three: If my vote matters, then why is it that it wouldn't have changed the outcome of any election? No election I've ever been able to vote in has been decided by a single vote. Not one. So, claiming my vote matters (in other words it would have changed anything) is demonstrably untrue.
Anthony Garcia	I love that the title says ‘President Obama’, not ‘Former President Obama’
JBzzzz	Obama is a ghetto hoodrat
Shim Novak	A great man indeed. We miss u Obama.
Amin	I am not even American or live in America just watch it for this guy awesome person
NPC 1873872	Orange man bad! vote demorat!!!!
C.D	My vote has been gerrymandered out of relevancy by Pennsylvania State Republicans.
NonScience	Aparently Obama hasn’t heard of the Equal pay act of 1963... Equal pay has been a law for 40+ years and he mentions it as an issue?
Nathaniel Russell	Excuse #8, I'm not 18 until November 8. Please give me tips on how to vote in midterm with this problem.
It's Cris	Obama with those comebacks tho😂
Hubble Tea	He’s been president for as long as I could remember, it still feels like he is. I’m a 2004 baby btw
Adan Vera	did I  hear woman rights and lgbt rights not on my watch.
Avissa A	THIS IS EVERYTHING.😁
Brent Mcchesney	I’ll vote. I’ll vote to keep America great.
superhanfeng	So refreshing to see him and hear him talking after getting used to the way Trump talks
ShadowEspioFan1	Its funny seeing the former president still keep going after the election cracking jokes and having a good time.  I may be a UK person but Obama was a great president no doubt.
Rin Kagame	Raise in minimum wage = No change in wage for employees making more than minimum wage > Food, Housing, Daily Necessities costs goes up > Larger divide in economy. I’m all for helping those who are struggling with money, but minimum wage is not our answer.
Steven Williams	His eyebrow are perfect.
shock jockey	#notmypresident
bacm flatstart	My excuse for not voting is because not only am I 13, but also because I am too busy looking at votes from minecon earth
Mahiraj Singh Chufal	This is the worldwide problem. This video should also be available in native languages of different counties so everyone can be benefited.
Athen Tang	is it possible to drag obama back for a third term somehow
Bill Jordan	Hail trump hail victory hail our people!
La Pal	He looks so much healthier now than when he was running for President. Good to see he's living a happy life.
Yol Stumah	Obama actually looks good like he looks less stressed
John Appleseed	Voting isn’t a bi-partisan issue. I don’t care who you vote for, just vote.
Hamza Khan	Like is there anyway Obama can come back? 😂
cody codytin	What if I'm a conservative republican, am I allowed to keep those guys in or should I only vote for Democrats?
Molly Spackman	I LOVE YOU OBAMA!!!! You are my hero and i want to thank you for everything you've done!! You are the person that made me proud to be an American!

xZANZIBARZx	*I ain't a fan of Obama* But the Pokémon joke was awesome kudos. Hopefully he wrote it *I don't like Pokémon either and that shit is sooper zombie; it just won't stay dead*
Gray Edgar	He's that turd that just doesn't go down the pan!
Antoinette Motley	Obama. I pledge my vote!!
Josef Stalin	One citizen of Wyoming has the same voting influence as seven Californians
loni75041	I miss the days of a competent president. Every time I see or hear the name Donald Trump, I'm reminded of one of this country's biggest mistake.
Livvie V.	My vote for dancing with the stars matters a lot in my mind thank you very much
Mr. Grey	_"A vote in this November's election actually does matter."_ No it often doesn't and as a former president you know that. Unlike pretty much every other democracy on the planet we don't use a popular vote for our leader. Your state's Electors are the ones that vote and your "vote" is just a suggestion that they do not have to follow. If you're in a red state and vote red you're a drop in a bucket of red paint, if you're in a red state and you vote blue you're a drop of blue in a bucket of red paint.  _"There are people running for office that don't think women should get equal pay for equal work"_ People like you? They already get equal pay for equal work, when it's actually equal work, but you wanted to give them more because debunking the Wage Gap myth is unpopular. _"who don't think we should do anything about schools being shot up"_ Which is every president in office for the past 70+ years, including yourself. None of you have the nuggets to *really* go against the gun lobby. _"Who don't think we should raise the minimum wage"_ Again, pretty much all of you. Sure you'll make token attempts but none of you will really go against your corporate masters. _"Vote in somebody that shares you values"_ Nobody that shares my values will get close to a position of power.
Roxy Hall	Google!
Staedler Staedlerr	idiot.

Kamran Kazemi-Far	I miss Obama, I really like his personality, I dont live in America but I hope you Americans vote, you people deserve better.
Alex C	The dumb thing is...you could have 10 people vote or 10 million people vote it doesn't really change anything..its like printing more money all it does it devalue money and cause inflation - the more people that vote the less valuable your vote becomes if it were just 10 people your vote would actually have a big impact
Unfunny Earthling	Doesn’t care about Pokemon  , hmmmm seems fishy
Ahaybalewithasliceofmelon	You don’t get to moan if you don’t vote, when you vote moan all you like.  (I’m british)
NPC #K1LLM3	THIS IS NOT PROPAGANDA - OBAMA IS COMPLETELY UNBIASED - LET US REJOICE
Chauhan Ashish	The coolest President Americans ever had. He touched lives globally.
Working Joe	DON'T BE ANOTHER NPC - TRUMP 2020
BigT53	Trump 2020
Sue Lewis	Hmmm where's number 8?..... "I don't want to vote because I don't wish to collude with a system which has proved to be corrupt" .
Charlotte Colbourne	Miss you Obama😫

Ini Ejidele	Obama used a playlist analogy 😂
matzmx	Such class. Well spoken. And compare to what you guys have now...
Ven	I'm not American but I'm watching this cause Obama
Hamzah Patel	2:30 Did he just insult 83% of America 😂😂
Lord Kek	Can't be bothered.....doesn't make a difference.
xShadow	barack was shit lmao
234,790,792 views	Hes not the president doe !!!.........he is just Barak Obama...........
TankNuke44	Okay I will go vote Republican now!
ursusrex	I Just Have One Thing To Say... OBAMA Is My President For Life.
kevin mucyo	Miss him 😭
Martin Shkreli	hes a good sales man!
Jessica moreno	Godmmit! Obama is so freaking smart! Argh! I got to go vote!
Dave Davidson	Vote them out, oh you mean vote for one of the two guys that actually have a chance. I'd happily go and vote for a total change to the system, removing most of the people involved, but we all know its the same people from the same class taking money from the same big companies etc. But what do I know, nothing, so I probably shouldn't be allowed to vote for change I can't even understand anyway. I'm a natural optimist by the way.
Felix Schoppen	I miss you barack!! Most unapreciated president ever!!
Anwarul Sifat	the coolest US president ever!!!
Bradshaw	Please come back Barry! We miss you and Michelle!
Joseph Juarez	Fuck you ATTN your are a biased news source against Trump
Deeq Adan	Even White People love Obama Funny Motherfucker lol
Kelly Corcam	It's more than words, its results.  If all your life needs is happy words have Mommy read you a fairy tail before you go to bed at night.  The rest of us Americans want a President who accomplishes what he campaigned on.
Omer Demirkan	Not biased at all.
rocklesson86	I miss him so much.
Jonny World	Glad this guy is out
Janelle Glass	I love President Obama, but what's with the Jay-z and Bey? Come on...they are overrated...smh But GO VOTE PEOPLE!!!
TheMojojay	Yeah its important to vote, for people like him, he did more drone attacks on anyone else, no trial , no jury, just killed from afar. I dont worry about putin or any other ass hat leader, just the dickheads of leaders that america bangs out.
Danny The Nerd	President Obama? Uh no, he ain't the president no more.
s10dlka	Remember the days when the US President could...you know...talk in coherent sentences.  Nowadays you need to be more educated to get a high school diploma than be the leader of the free world!
Jose Santos	1 excuse. I’m not of age to vote
Benzaiten	I miss President Obama. can we please pretend the last two years didn't happen?
Chris Sanchez	Attn: proof you are deluded, he is a has been. No magic wand , he could not figure out what it takes to create jobs and get consumer confidence. Socialism is not the answer.
Mizloudmouth7	Throw that shade Obama!
Cruise Addiction TV	Being uninformed about who is running and what amendments are up for vote is because we get bombarded by advertisements for the people and not what they have done and what their plan is. The amendments are advertised with little to no information on them. If we can stop the attack ads and have ads for the people that have plans to change the system, that would be much better and much easier. Also the advertisements don't have a website that I can go to for myself and look at what these people are going to be putting into effect.
Levelonesucks	Damn he's good
Thomas Schaefer	I'm from Germany and it's so funny and at the same time pretty awful that Mr. Obama is still after he's out of office for almost two years now, far more presidential than Trump. This is an outside perspective
George Cross	Thank you Former President Obama! I’ll be sure to take my ballot and vote for the Republican candidate in Delaware 😃
Ben Velasquez	Like how Latinos helped him, yet his administration has the biggest deportation numbers ever? Neither one getting a vote.
Chase Forestello	Obama tell us WHO thinks that school being shot up should stay that way? Just who? Who think women should make less than men solely because of gender? Who? Politics is nasty, almost all of these fuckers lie and take advantage. 700,000 minors illegally entered the U.S. so Obama decided to grant them "normalized residency" but he damn sure wasn't going to grant them citizenship all the while the tax payer pays for it. Trump on the other hand says tough shit BYE BYE and everyone freaks out???? Open your eyes, Obama knew what he had to do to look good but he knew that citizenship was not an option so he does the bare minimum while creating a massive long term problem in the process, all to save some face? Thanks Obama.
Feder147	Lol Obama turned white
0 000	In a way, it's sad that your former President has to do this, exactly what I am trying to tell people on my own bloody humble channel and I am European-African but white so no views, at least Barak Obama is great شكرا باراك اوباما!
Jo'kel	"as most things, voting's more fun if you do it together." meanwhile in germany...
Kjelly Lund	He made me want to vote, but then I forgot I am not American. I am Norwegian.
// Braneofficial //	Dude im from germany and even I wanna vote right now.
Demon Slayer 561	Dam obama aged 30 years in the last 10 years.
mayaa03	OBAMA ! what dumbass! just SFU and go away
SonOfThaSoil _	He had 4:32 of time to say as much tho lol
shimmy.ojeleye	us not voting in 2010 led to one of the worst losses in congressional seats for the incumbent party in the history of our nation, in obama's first midterm. maybe we can make up for that a little by voting this november? happy voting people.
R C	why does his voice sound so weird sometimes? It's almost like they didn't record some stuff and fixed it in editing by mashing together clips
Zephyr Stobart	I like this guy. He should run for President.
Em W	I live on the other side of the world from the USA and I don’t think the midterms are boring.......
wendynico25	So sad and sorry for America
felicote	Snarky Obama is my favorite Obama
Rezolutionist	"...because they haven't." - superfunny, Obama rocks!
G.S.PRASANTH JUREDDY	Man, he is so cool....i wish India have a president like him....he is never seemed like a president , he is like a Friend of people.
AlejPix	1:18 😂
Frank-Gavin Moratalla	Oh my President, my President,  how I miss thee and rational  thought and compassion!
boykiddman	Obama: Go out and vote! (slips in recommendation on which party to vote for.)   This isn't about informing the public. It's about getting young voters to vote blue. Sure Obama is a cool dude, is way more eloquent than Trump, and has a better sense of humor, but this is still propaganda guys.
Nicholas Tarpinian	He looks younger
Clay Carmichael	Yes I will vote. I will vote Republican
Sooner Admirer	It's ironic that young people want to vote for Democrats that have already said they would either raise taxes to save entitlement spending or just refuse to touch it (which will incur more debt).
NCC-1701	#6 and #7 in my state is non existent. We have mail in ballots.
Ranjit K. Nair	This guy is awesome! Respect from India. _/\_
R R	3:20 Well Mr. President... there are some lazy people out there that you can’t pay them to get them out of their living room to go to vote.  I’ll bring you an example. I worked the phone during Hillary Campaign. We were provided with maps and locations of voting places as well as campaign volunteers on the ground. There was a person I called and I asked her if she would commit to vote. She said well she doesn’t know where the voting spot is and I told her she said she doesn’t know where it is. While on the phone I google map(ed) her place from the voting place. Then she said she thinks it’s too far of a walk. I said I understand I can arrange a ride for you. There are campaign volunteers on the ground who would gladly come pick you up, wait for you until you vote and then drive you back to your house. She made all kinds of excuses and I asked her if Hillary is the candidate she would vote for or would she rather choose Trump? Her responses was swift! Hillary of course she said. Well guess what Mr. President, I almost am certain that she had no problem flying to DC on the Inauguration Day and shout and protest. Did it matter then? Did it even change anything? Well that was too late wasn’t it? I’m not blaming her specifically but there are thousands who were in the same situation. I hope lessons have been learned. Thank you for reading. And thank you for staying involved! I’m still with Her!
o m	how do you decide between two candidates when both of them have views you despise? i want to vote, but i'd feel guilty voting for either of them.
Captain Howdy	The best advertisement would be Obama was not a dream Time to wake up and vote 🗳 MAGA 2020 . And then finish it off with this was paid for by wake up America . Org
Javon Ezell	😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂
NPC#0R4N93	Blue wave baby! 🌊  (Seriously tho, as much as I hate commie bastards, I miss you papa bama)
Rohmash	"I don't care about pokemon, but that doesn't mean it won't keep coming back" Put that in the history books folks.
MOTH	Daddy Obunga 💦💦💦
Blondie Wise	Thanks Obama
jhorn188	Only problem is when the so called democracy is so corrupt that it's really an oligarchy run by the big money corporations. No matter what candidate the people vote for, the politics will not correlate with the peoples wishes at all, but correlate very closely with the interests of the rich.
Minho Song	I'm currently outside the country. How do I vote?
ishu gupta	Excuse 8 : Obama isn't running
Janno Jacomille	Straight to the heart of non-voting snowflakes...
CrystalCoyoteX	That the trolls are here, imitating delusional movements like the birthers that have faded into obscurity, should serve as a heads up to everyone. They do not like this man. Some say "bring him back," and others say, "identity fraud" but the inflammatory aspects are the same.  Don't let them get to you.  Ignore that bs and hear pay attention to the guy who actually has something real to say. It ain't me, I'm not that full of myself. But the guy with the real message just released a very patriotic video telling you and your mamma to get out there and vote.  You should. I don't have to agree with you, but you should. You have that right. So vote, and don't let that caustic riffraff in the comments turn this into a firestorm for you.
T J	How do we know who to vote for?
Black Dot	american people are sick of these liberals bullying everyone on their tv shows award shows VOTETRUMP bitch

Sk. Sabit Faisal	coolest president the US have ever seen
Adrian Robinson	His ears is so big... Lol...
Deon Van der Westhuizen	Somehow he managed to put a massive divide between the USA races.
Zzul Ma	What a cool guy. 2016 feels so long ago 😭😭😭
Surbhit Agrrawal	Although I’m a Right Wing supporter, one has to agree that Obama’s youth connect is just amazing!
Christopher Dibbs	I don't get all this about not voting. In Australia, it compulsory to vote. You literally _have_ to vote - it's illegal not to. You'll get fined.  But I agree, looking through what people had for dinner probably _is_ boring.
Key	How do you do fellow kids?
Aaditya Desai	Even I'm not an American, I still enjoy his talks. Coolest president I've ever seen! 👏
Timmy Smith	I really liked his responses for excuses 2-7, but my main thing is excuse one. I don't really care to much about politics and I'm still not sure why I should?
Yigyigs	This is so savage I love it. This can relate to any voting system I guess
Inês Machado	No longer president but still cares.  <3
Ozioma Sydney Eze	We won’t even let our parents pick our outfits! 1:55

InkMonTima s Poetry	Miss him so much oh my God
UninstallingWindows	He should have said that its a new challenge that everybody is taking part of. Obama: "Eating tide-pods is so yesterday. All the cool kids these days take pictures of themselves voting for the most reasonable candidate" * Highest voter turnout follows *
Eric Girardet	Hello everyone, I am from Switzerland and you probably know that my country is really small compared to your country but here, our political system is based on Direct Democracy. I don’t know if you could apply that system to the US.  What the world doesn’t understand is the way you electe a president. Yes, this unbelievable thing call the grand electors system. It seems completely outdated and unfair. A candidate could win the majority of the citizen votes but still loose the election because of that grand electors system. Is there anyone or political party who wish to change it for a more fair and democratic one? And, YES, please go and VOTE! That’s why your veterans made the ultimate sacrifice, is that you, regular citizens, can live in a democracy. If your rights and freedom is getting slowly away from you, your nation is drifting slowly but surly into a dictatorship like (lovely) Russia (I love the Russian, it’s a great nation) or Turkey (and Turkish people a really nice as well) VOTE!!!
Alvin Lee	My God, I've missed this man.
lisa koola	i love you ❤️ we love you  he is my President 🇺🇸

AWESOME SAUSEY	Miss having a guy who could make a good joke
Adam Donahue	How did they not include, “I’m only one person. What’s the difference?”
Brandon	283,000 views so far. Every one of you mf’ers who is eligible to vote better do it. Otherwise this is just another YouTube video you watched while you were sitting on the toilet.
TheBusttheboss	I don't think Obama would want you to vote if you were Republican.
Sukriti Kiran	God... I miss him
wmrt167	Just got my absentee ballot today and voted abroad from Japan! Don't sit this one out.
Sergio	Uhmm...Obama * not president Obama
The Angry Intellect	You're a fucking idiot.  You said in the title "president Obama" - HE ISNT THE FUCKING PRESIDENT.  You don't post shit and say because at one point in time someone did a job so they are forever referred to by their position in that previous job.  If I stop working as a delivery driver for dominos and become a CEO of a bank, I'm not still the delivery driver.  Fucking dipshit.
Benjamin Tarrant	this channel likes comments that call Trump a joke and then tells us its unbiased.
Xavier McQueen	People, please don’t just vote by party. Vote for the individual that appeals the most to you. This goes both ways, just because you are left or right doesn’t mean you only have the options that you side with. Please do some research before picking based solely on if they’re red or blue.
Acin75	Haaaaaaah!I love this guy!!!!!😍😍😍😍
dnahubs	This was great!  Informational, witty and funny.  Come on now everybody, if you've got time to view this and comment, then you've got time to vote.

cioda	Lord Almighty. Obama had his issues. But dear God did he actually show that he cared about the people of this country. Not just the white ones.   I would vote for Obama if I could. God help this country.
Oliver Lutsch	omg America you fucked up so bad. You had the sweetest most genuine guy as president and now you have a joke. Go change that again! you can do it!

SuperHorseman22	Obama sucks. Voting does not matter
Lynn Belvedere	Watch 11/9, Mr. Michael Moore's new movie, and tell me you believe this man or anyone else for that matter. There are times where your vote does not matter. Ask over 90% of the voters in the great state of West Virginia. Thank you. -Mr. Belvedere
Daryl Wathen	Such a quality guy with good advice. He makes a great point about those guys not knowing much about the internet, The internet is a pretty big deal now, it seems politicians should have a clue about it and how it affects people.
Hotpinkrandomness	How I miss you you sweet angel man
Ed Moritz	I miss bork obma hate orange man sexist pin pls
•Magnivince •	My god the amount of ignorance in this comment section..... Listen I get you hate Donald trump and I hate him too but the amount of peo le who think Barack Obama was a messiah for America is TOO DAMN HIGH. Guys let me remind you America’s dept literally got worse by 1 TRILLION , let me remind you the fact this was the guy who caused fast and furious THIS was the guy who literally fucked the entire Democratic Party by giving them more than 10 million dollars in debt STOP KISSING THIS GUY’S ASS!

snail snail	How have you been most effective in persuading someone to vote?
Tyler cox	I’m pretty sure the only reason we are still in The Middle East is to stop ISIS
ibrahim mohamed	I don't vote because when I go for holiday outside of the country I still have to vote or I will be charged with a lot of money. I'm not registered so they don't know if i voted or not.  I'm from the country don't think I'm illegaly in the country!!!
Jeffrey Hudson	I freakin hate this guy!! So glad I don't have to cringe when I watch Fox anymore!!
Pawn Doe	Awesome! Minus the scrolling through dinner thing... That joke has been played for at least 5 years.
SoniCraft98	I’m a republican. I may disagree with Obama on a lot of stuff, but boy do I miss this dude’s way with words. Thanks for convincing me to vote, Obama!
Haikrisna	This guy create isis in middle east and stil hve ball to talk about politic
NiogHalvFemsProblemer	"My vote doesn't matter." Aaand he makes absolutely no mention of First Past The Post, or the importance of a representative democracy...
Leopard-King	Sweet hopeful innocent children, the political saviors that implore you to vote them in for your protection are the ones that rigged the piano to fall on you in the first place.  Vote if you wish, but only two things moves politics, money and arms.   Ready for your two styles of leadership?  In your face, unsophisticated, brute apathy, or clever, charming, sleight of hand apathy.   Both sides hand out their bones.  Good luck suckers!
djhero0071	I really don’t give a fuck if you align more democrat, republican or what but if you’re 18, you should vote!!! You gotta vote!!! Governor, senator, state judges!!!! All of these guys affect you more directly than the president!!!! Guess when they’re voted for? MIDTERMS!!! So if things feel like they’re going wrong in your state (like high college tuition, unjust laws like for abortion rights, etc.)  V O T E!!!!!
SwedishBlouse	He's not the president...he's trash...
Angelik Yusty	Jajajajajajaja I love his sarcasm 😜😜😜😜
TheRoflcopterGod	I wish politics was based more on good debate over current and proposed government held morals, ethics, policy, and law, but instead it’s more about who is the most charismatic and/or instigating. This has been a potential issue ever since the radio was invented, giving FDR a natural advantage over any possible challenger (because how can a person compete with someone who “talks to you”). Social media has made this worse. I am reminded each time I see Trump or Obama speak on camera. Btw, I hold nothing against Obama and I was a supporter of his so no personal attacks please.
Yimei Cai	The former president is forced to work more because the current one isn’t doing work.
Afruza Hasib	Oh God! He’s glowing!!
Generalsaurkraut	Nice guy. But he couldn’t run a lemonade stand. I’ll take the crazy asshole that gets results.

angel83119 Fiona	Papa!!!
Jacob Johnson	I love Obama, but God, this is the most overtly millennial-pandering thing I've ever seen.
Madison Grooters	Obama’s really out here dissing millennials through jokes about Coachella, using the internet, and a Beyoncé concert 😩🔥💦 we need him back in office
TWSTF 8	Remember when our President WASN'T a complete embarrassment?   Ah, the good 'ol days. Way back when a person was expected to have at least as much integrity as the people whom they were elected to represent.   Back when the greatest Nation in the history of the Planet insisted on a basic level of honor and civility in their leadership.   Luckily, the arc of history ALWAYS bends towards justice.
Alexandru Zepciuc	I was small, stupid and not into politics to enjoy having a real, great leader of the free world :/. And here I am in this nightmare...
Tribune Luke	Failed to answer a large reason why people don't vote.  Neither candidate holds values or represents what you believe.  Of course he wouldn't have an answer for that.  Party politics subverts democracy at all levels, reducing your choices to a binary options, both of which aren't worried about your particular interests or concerns.    I wish for a day I could ask some one like Obama such a question.  What does one do in the face of a democracy that no where near represents what you believe or what values you hold?  What does one do in the face of a democracy that operates with only the consent of it's own party members.  I did not consent to this current Government and I perhaps will not consent to the next Government.   Of course no one wants to answer, difficult questions.
Sudarshan Jain	It heppens quite less that you enjoy listening an ex-world leader so much... Its an absolute joy to listen to Mr. Obama...
Rajon Rondo	Lightskin Obama, fuck cp3 ringless head ass
Nito Maldonado	When I see trustworthy candidates that actually have valid truth and character.  And represents my people then I’ll vote.......
Jonanice	his cracking up at 1:25 made me smile
Lucy Bonilla	Damn Obama looks different. He looks well rested
Cons and Piracy Theorums	If you can't address me directly and say my name then you are worthless and marked for death. Fuck you Obama
Snodge Kat	Vote!!! My dear American neighbours, please VOTE!!!!!! 🇨🇦💖🇺🇸
stephen sewell	muslim cunt
Richard Bidwell	When are we gonna make voting days a Federal Holiday? Seems like this should be a major goal for Democrats in the future.
Jerry	3:37 Obama giving everyone who doesn't vote the finger 😂
Jed Findlay	ATTN:  Please edit your captions, they are not correct in a few spots. Thank you.
LadyHashZ	Shut up.
Sam K	Useless president, total waste of 8 years.
Chenai Sabeta-Boadi	Is this really Barrack? Or is this a fake?
cyndie26	Here's another one: if you live in a constituency with a "safe" seat, the "safe" candidate may rely on the lack of opposition voter turnout to win the election, potentially leading to a loss of a "guaranteed" election. Go out and defend your candidate of choice, whether it means defending the "safe" seat or opposing it, as your candidate may have a chance at winning just as much as your candidate has a chance at losing.
Jose Juan	All the probar that put a dislike are probably brainless haters who does not want a successful country, but a circus and a pig shitting all over their faces while they do nothing!!
Kirby Le	Went from Bush to Obama and then to Trump? Bad to good to worse. Let's not make the same mistake again.
Miriam Mazer	Come back, Obama. T_T
Elizabeth Starling	Mah man
Tiny Rock	He’s killing it even when Luther has a day off.
Qisthas Noe'man	Haha this thing has google
Shietal Ramesh	For your own sake America .. take charge before it is too late  ---------  Rest of the world
Jason WakingUpDad	Politics 100% aside. Obama is just a better human being than Trump... I'd rather invite Bush II to my thanksgiving dinner before I'd pick up a phone call from Trump. God I miss having sensible president. Right or left I dont care.
Navateja Vardhan	He is roasting trump in a way
César Cormier	i MISS THIS GUY!
W. Kamara Njoku	He doesn’t stutter anymore hehe love you Barack.
*김태진	Obama is as weak as Jimmy Carter. I'm glad Trump won in 2016. Trump 2020!
sewagii	Why is voting always about choosing what you like?`  This is total bullshit. You should also vote if you are not satisfied with any candidate. Maybe you do not have a favorite, but there are also candidates that you do not like?  You are hungry and you can choose cold soup OR hard bread. No one would think of anything to eat. The cold soup tastes like shit, but is still better than hard bread
LiziBeth000	The makeup artist did him wrong...
ziv71	Obama is the real joke
Archibald Tuttle	This is so refreshing!
Kalana Herath	To those who don't care about politics: Okay, but politics, though not being your interest, very much still affects your life
lil lizzard	I really don't understand why you guys in the US need to register for voting. Isn't it enough to just be a citizen and bring your ID?
Rex Arthur	Lol scrolling on your endless dinners posted on Instagram is boring 😂😂😂 teach on Barack Obama.. #CivicEducation
Sathyajith Shankar	God, I hope all these appearances by Obama actually make an impact in making the dems win because boy I'm scared
Jovanii Patino	Type in your address boom it’s that simple . (Camera change) (awkward silence) There no joke here ..
FrozenMonkey824	So, basically vote for baby murdering, illegals loving, sexual assault accusing, filthy fucking Democratic worms. No thanks Obama.
Jessica Harding	That a man with class, intelligence, sensitivity and humor. MISS HIM
Ellie Corr	I miss Obama!!!
Christian Topayung	I don't trust any of candidates
sandy ray	Wow go away already.
khabane Cisse	God! This dude knows how to talk!
XiD Chan	So……Obama becomes the wise old man finnally.  —from Key and peel Skit😏
Aliens	Obama is the president we'd laugh with. Not like trump the one that we laugh at.
Thank You	Honestly i miss this man so much everytime i see him or hear a speech from him... I just cry!!! That man had so much class!!!!!!! So much class.....
Ty Chanel	God I Miss Obama😕💕
Devin Padilla	What an absolute unit. Love that lad!
Justsaying something	Meanwhile In Sweden, we might have a re-election cause none of the parties got enough votes to win and they can't work together in order to decide which party should lead the country. Good times to be alive.
s.0nam	I can't vote because I'm not American.
Kyto Bytes	Voting simplified: Do you want to do heroin with the Bloods? OR Do you want to do meth with the Crips?  The two party system is incredibly flawed, and 3rd party wont win because everyone says "3rd party wont win", rather then just voting 3rd party.   What I have learned, is pretty much everyone is incompetent, yet thinks that they are perfect.   All i want is a president who agrees equality is important ( on a global level, not just National), who has a understanding and respect for science in the ssame fashion Trump respects nazis and religion.  Anyways, I'm 26, ex Army, still not registered to vote, and I have yet to see a reason to convince me to vote. Having tto pick your poison is unacceptable in my opinion. Like I always say "if you place meth and heroin on a table and ask me to pick one, ill choose to walk out".
Bradmyr	I miss you so much!
Niko Bellic	If you didnt vote NPC will
AtypicalWeirdo	Seriously I miss him. He had a sense of Humor. And now we just have.. yEAH.
Amrit K.B	VOTE AMERICANS!!!! For god sake for yoyr country sake please vote and do some good for America and world. Many countires are deep into corruption they look at few world nations for best examples and America after selecting Trump ruined it for everyone. All presidents what achieved the peace and harmony among the world, Trump is destroying in every sense. Vote for good governers and improve your life balance with good infrastructure... education, medical facilities or atleast social security... when the time will come throw this trump baffon out of oval he tarnished it enough. He is a disgrace on white house...
Abubakr Hassan	I want a president like you  :'(  ours just care about filling their bellies even if it means killing us or selling the country and of course it's obvious that the elections are rigged, because almost 99.999% of the people despise him and still he gets 97% on elections
keesalemon	He's not the president anymore. I know that it massively sucks that he's not, but the title of this video is inaccurate to call him president. Maybe put "former president "
Patrick Castillo	0:16 this officially makes him the worst president right?
Alfian Sofakhair	Pokemon 😆
Marta Viðar	is it just me or has obama become super sassy
Anarcho Toast	I refuse to vote because it gives legitimacy to the Capitalist system!
Gavan Schultz	Thank you Mr Obama from Ireland. It was wonderful seeing a US president like you in office who stopped the recession before it got worse. Also it's nice to have a president who's biggest scandal was only "I think you were born in Kenya (blatantly disregard birth certificate)"
Loroyal	*Obama oh na...nnaa* Hey *I'm stuck here in Atlanta naa...naa ahhh* Hey
Kaiser68	I don't know if No.2 is a good reason. Shouldn't the people in office just be the best people for the job? Why do they have to look like me, or have sex with the same gender(s) as I have sex with. Vote in people with principles and beliefs, not based on what danglies they have!!!
The Big Bad Ned	A righteous personality with no understanding of foreign relations, a true gem you were.
Wet sock Productions	I miss you so much come back
Wookien	Dear Americans. Please please please vote.   All the best, The Rest of the World
Dobby Maltese	went from president who tells a joke to president who is the joke

I really like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez now cuz, I mean, she's just so smart and everything. I still think you're smarter but you gotta admit she's just so....well you know....smart.
Isaac Rajagopal	1:24 hahahaha
knockoutfever4	2nd worst President behind Bush Jr
miguelr246	Can't vote democrat if they don't care about Pokemon.
chrissy5291	So, the title says President Obama instead of former President. I am ok with this.
Kevin Duggan	Thank you Obama for starting a new Cold War or if you didn’t just being so crappie at the job you were assigned that we are in one. BTW and attacking our bill of rights is not cool if you don’t like it you can leave no one stopping you it’s free country.
Muhammad Bashir Musa	God I miss this man please come back.
Gr8 Incarnate	These elections ARE more important than presidential elections.
Bryan Batchelor	We need this guy back
Daniel Bautista	All these excuses will go down the drain if you come back 😢
Vinci Vince	If you really dont care who wins then I think that is a good reason to not vote.
GoGreen1977	In Colorado, everyone registered to vote should receive a ballot by mail, weeks before the election.  You can take your time to study the candidates and ballot initiatives before you fill out the ballot.  Then you can put a couple of stamps on the return envelope and mail it or drop it in a drop off ballot box near you, without stamps.  Or you can go to your assigned polling station on election day prepared to vote if you take the time to study the issues beforehand.  If you are too lazy or indifferent to vote in Colorado, then you should move to state that makes it difficult to vote or really doesn't want you to vote!
Rivers727	I relate to Obama. I too don't care for Pokemon.
Noor Ahmed	Wait did he say 'pokimane'?
SHDU Studios	I love Obama so much.
Japanthewoman	Politics aren't boring. You know what's boring? Scrolling through pictures of your dinner on Instagram. 🤣
Charlene S	GOD I MISS HIM
Alan Husky	Srry not srry to say this but im not voting and i dont think I ever will... I don't want to be responsible for voting for the next big idiot to have a small or large amount of power and waste it on shit... I don't like the political parties and will never like them because corruption seeps its way thru... Voting is and always has been about "literally"  picking your poison... Idc what u have to say about it...
whattheflimflam	Cant wait to vote red so I can continue to enjoy the good economy and snowflake meltdowns. MAGA!
leland grover	I hate to break it to you Obama but most young adults & people in general aren't too receptive to being patronized.
Finemasilm	I wonder if he regrets not being more radical when he had the chance
Valarie Williams	President Obama is the BEST 🗳 Vote November 6, 2018
Ruben Espinoza	Let me tell you guys out front, I have my reservations and opinions over former President Obama and what he did during his presidency. However, I feel that he is more gracious and act more charismatic than this current joke of a president.
Jack Crowley	On the ballot in Michigan this year is prop 2, which would give the drawing of voting districts to an independent committee. Vote yes, friends
Tona V.	I was unfriended by so many people because I implied that they need to vote. For the most part they're not bad guys, but they're actively contributing to the failure of the country, and in turn, the death of the world.
Donald-Ud-Deen Trump	“You know what’s boring?  Scrolling through endless photos of your dinner on Instagram.”  BURN!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
EH PA	This is what it·er·a·cy sounds like. /ˈlidərəsē,ˈlitrəsē/ noun noun: literacy the ability to read and write. synonyms: ability to read and write, reading/writing proficiency; learning, book learning, education, scholarship, schooling  "literacy and numeracy are the first goals of education" competence or knowledge in a specified area. "wine literacy can't be taught in three hours"
Josh Garcia’s Video Vault	When people say “I don’t relate,” I believe that, unfortunately, they are saying, “I don’t think they know my shoes, and act accordingly.” Unfortunately for us and HIS FOLLOWERS, Trumpey did exactly that for them (bullshit though it all is...)   People don’t understand all that goes into politics. Perhaps better TV would be NOT, “oh I’m Native American DNA, daddy worked hard, blah, blah, blah...” It might be, “You think you live in the jungle, see those guys over there, they are there to preempt people from shooting at me from a rooftop,” “Every time, I get on stage, I have to be careful about what I say to an absurd degree because I could get sued.” “I work to keep the country running 24/7/365 and only make xxxxxx, and I CANNOT understand why someone believes that they are entitled to 480 times that amount because they simply THOUGHT UP A BUSINESS, but also aren’t the ones making that money everyday, it DRIVES ME NUTS because it makes me think that society doesn’t think what I do MATERS!!!” You’re close Obama, but you still need to take the “Red Pill of Relationality,” go ahead take it, 💊  NO, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS INDUSTRY IN THE DEMOCRAT’S POCKET AGAIN!! I know America needs to protect it’s economy, but we need to have the balls, moral aptitude, and foresight to see that it is GREED, not low wages that is the root problem.LOW WAGES are a SYMPTOM of the disease. Do you protect against Chicken Pox with calamine lotion?! NO, you vaccinate (these days.) Like I have been scream at Senator Sanders, WE NEED GREED REFORM in this country! Money is a good thing. But what does too much of a good thing create? Evil. So, (too much) money is the root of all evil, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and wage inequality we have. Raising the minimum wage works just long enough for people to forget they were being screwed before the prices of goods and services get raised YET AGAIN for the MILLIONTH TIME. Valuing the economy yes, but what does valuing the economy do? Make each dollar worth less and less, yes, very good! SO, we need to say, “OH GREAT, you founded a business, once you get that 100 MILLION in your personal equity, it is NOW TIME to A) Reinvest in the PEOPLE in your company (not just the company, Apple,) or B) Make a new company, or C) Give up the business life, become a musician, travel, or GO TO CHURCH, because, there’s more to life than a little money yah know?”  Yep. Facts.  Tell me, would more people invest in the stock market if everyone had $75,000/yr. at their disposal AND the price of good and services REMAINED THE SAME TOO? You betcha!! Shit man, and I’m a psych major.... ya’all don’t know this??!!  Ahem, do you jobs please Washington, ahem...  Yes, MAIL VOTE! I love my mail vote and I’m not 65 yet. I’m 40, but I love it because I CAN use the internet, it comes to me before the election so I don’t forget there is an election because I too have “other things to do,” for as important as voting is, the short-term liability of paying the rent is MORE important for us in the moment.   Other than that an-as-always-excellent-Obama message that I approve of.... still waiting for my “universal healthcare” I gave you $25 for (-_-#)
AsherSax	I love President Obama, but this video is sort of ridiculous. ATTN: "We need to find a way to get 44 to say 'Pokemon', 'Coachella', 'Instagram', and 'playlist'." So subtle, guys.
Anthony Swope	Mr. President you gotta point about the old white dudes in Congress and the internet, how can people be allowed to rule if they ate do out of touch???
jimmy dean	For the midterm elections are boring one he should have said "in this election you can vote in enough people to stop trump from being able to do any more retarded shit"
Frederick Martinez	Vote Republican
La Republica Jorgista	Im voting for Trump. My first time voting.
Mohammad Nachawati	He's glaringly wrong on number 1.  Politicians want you to vote.  They want you to think that your only voice politically is a vote that really doesn't matter.  Your vote is a transmission of acceptance.  You accept whatever they do, whether you voted for the winning candidate or not.  George Carlin said it best.  Don't vote.
dj comup	Vote for me and i'll set yall free sound like slavery when our ancestors had to fight at battle fields for our freedom same ass line....tired ass lies arrogant americans don't even appreciate veterans who had die there ass so civilians can keep there sweet jobs..

Michael Wu	奥巴马真的帅，而且口语是真的好听。
tiny99990	omfg @ 1:25 when he couldn't hold in his own laughter, that was awesome... he looks a ton happier than when he was president, less reserved too.
Muesli Snipes	7 excuses not to vote:  1: You're a cis white male 2: Old white male  3: Straight white male  4: You're a white supremacists 5: You support #OrangeMan (voting rights revoked) 6: You're a young white male (non Hispanic decent)   7: You're misogynist white male
S Rowe	Excellent advice.  Ghandi once said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world."  Obama said, 'Turn out and vote, November 6th, and take some friends with you.  It only takes a few minutes, and it's really important to take an active role in the selection of the people who represent you.'  Thank you, Mr. President.
wizzzer1337	remember actual human beings? man... 2016 is such a long time ago....

Dani de Janeiro	Fuck I fucken love that man
English Tea	We haven't had a real president since 20 Jan 2017.

MrTomfoxy	I LOVE YOU ❤️💕😇  I feel so much safer when you speak!!!
Jack Jammen	As long as we stop them from purging our vote!!
Markus Buhl	God i miss Obama. He represents a time when I was still hopeful for the future...
Monsieur Octopus	Thank you mr Obama for reafirming what all conservatives will do while your mob of sjw-npc's will be washing the streets with their liberal's tears on this glorious day. First time in history when America is colored red coast to coast. #DRINK LIBERAL TEARS #LOCK EM UP

Owen Jack Goodwin	When the world was not horrific
Typically Thomas	When I'm on a camera crew and the person we're interviewing says "It's a wrap" I want to punch them. Obama on the other hand... gets to say that as often as he wants!
Ned Rostram	Obama was such an amazing president. It's a shame that there aren't that many politicians as eloquent, intelligent, charismatic, empathetic, humorous, and tenacious as Obama out there.
APPLE & HAPPY x-files	Aww finally a beautiful voice and a beautiful face .... My President 😍

Skolastika Winta	Dude, i'm not even American but i wanna promote to Americans to vote. So GO VOTE PEOPLE!! There are state where you can vote early, by mail,by email, there are also where you have to register a month before or 2 days before. Please learn it for your area. Your vote *will* affect the future of your country. For your own country, the place where you grow up and live, GO VOTE FOR CHRIST SAKE.
jimmid32	But wait .. He's full of excuses though ?? Worst president in 44 terms. Thank God Elections Have Consequences 🇺🇸 Sad the pathetic, leftist, lemming Obamabots comments on here. Still completely taken in by this charlatan, snake oil salesman. Fortunately for the rest of us he wasn't able to do a third term and triple his damage saddling countless more generations with his foolish spending and inability to do anything remotely positive for the people of this country. You can lead a dipshit horse to water, but you'll never be able to make it drink. Listen to Barry Hussein you fools. You have no sense to think on your own. If you have any personal questions for him maybe you can try him at his 8 million dollar mansion in DC. Much like your other heroes the Clintons, that showed up to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave bankrupt, He and Michelle became Mega millionaires off of the taxpayers of this country. Clearly he cares about the average person. Just like he cared about the kids in South Chicago that got shot on a daily basis through his eight years of deplorable presidency,  The town that he called his home. Sad 😥 Just out of curiosity why did he wait till the 11th Hour to campaign for his successor Hilary??? Do foolish lemmings ever ask themselves these questions?? Did he have any excuses then for that? 🤔 Maybe he was hanging out with new buddy Richard Branson 🤔
TrueSake	Miss the days when we had a respectful, educated, positive and caring President.
Sexy1	president obama watching you takes that awful stomach ache away that i get when i watch trump  your medicine to the usa is surely missed
Vanessa Sah	!!!!....Come back...!!!!
vptes1	0:48 It’s not about race or gender, dude. It’s about political beliefs. I’m a libertarian and none of the candidates represent me, as usual.
Mitchell Sheppard	He just seems like such a great guy
MrAramis02	The voter suppressing strategies of the republicans got this election in the bag.  You non white democrats bitches aint got nothing.  Prove me wrong, america
demetrick edwards	Excuse 8: ELECTORAL COLLEGE. Bush vs Gore, Gore won the American vote, bush became president. Hillary won the American vote and Trump is president. OUR VOTES DON'T MATTER
just a random guy	fuck Obama if you don't care about Pokemon I don't care about you
Ultimate Powerlifting	Wait until the red wave floods y'all. You liberals are going to drown.
NPC753235896447 75	Gosh, I wish Obama was still president.  100x times better than Blumpf!
会員ピカ様クラブ	政治にポケモンを出さないでくれ
Shweta Crawford	Decent man..best president ever.
Carl Arteaga	Barack Obama is among the greatest of American and world leaders.  In 2020, the United States will need an outstanding Democratic statesman like him elected President.  As for the present, it's hard to believe a putrid piece of trash like Donald J. Trump is the current American President.  Trump isn't a credible public figure.  Or, reputable.  Or, ethical.  Or, a moral man.  Trump and his followers want everyone to do as they do, and cater to and live for the worst sides of human nature.  Trump willfully lies through his teeth every day.  Trump and his followers champion "alternative facts", also known as CRAPOLA, and disgrace the United States around the world every single day.  Trump and his supporters, including Republicans in Congress, don't give a damn about hard-working immigrants or immigration reform, or about victims of sexual harassment or assault, or about the number of victims who've been slaughtered when one of us abused his privilege to own a firearm, or about the consequences of ever-worsening global climate change, or about fellow American men, women, and children with pre-existing conditions who now have potentially life-saving health insurance coverage, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.  We'll see if the majority of Americans throughout the United States can still be rational, still be engaged, still be decent, and will VOTE OUT perennial liar and hatemonger, corrupt pervert and bigot, and utter stupid swine Trump and ALL of his useless, self-serving Congressional Republican enablers when the day arrives!  The opportunities are coming.  Starting on November 6, 2018 just around the corner!!
Mhambi Musonda	I miss having thoughtful intelligent President. #ComebackBarack
firstdayofwinter	Obama is so cute XDD I love how he is explaining what to do if you don't have time to vote XD also I cracked up when he whispered that the ppl questioning Zuckerberg don't know how to use the internet XD he tried so hard to talk in "young ppl language" too, like in a somewhat embarrassing but also cute dad way
kittydreamz86	I miss feeling like the world wasn't ending and our country was being led by a competent adult who cares about humans.
Timothy Harrison	Obama for prez 2020 should be the direction the dems head in, Michele would do a great job
Krista Johnson	Doesn't care about Pokemon? Just lost all credibility with millenials :P Jk ilu bud
X Y	#ThanksObama ;)
R Ma	Amend the Constitution so this guy can have at least 5 more terms as pres!
Max English	At 3:25 he says “vote.org” but you can tell he must have said .com and they got a separate recording of him saying “.org”
Sunny Singh	I have been working on my ballot for a week now. I did not do this much research for my college essays as I am doing for the ballot issues.
karenKristal	why did they put make up on his eyebrows? The man is perfect, he doesnt need making up, we just need to hang on his every word.
Kenneth Simmons	People voted for you, Barack, thinking you supported traditional marriage, only to find out you'd lied to them. And you wonder why people don't like listening to you politicians...
Super Thunder Gamer	Obama’s the man! He’s one of my favorite presidents!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸We need another Obama like people in power who are for and by the people! Not a Autocrat like Trump, but a Democrat like Obama’s! We need people who support the Constitution, our Representative Liberal Democracy, Freedom, Liberty, our Federal Republic, Neo Conservatism, Liberalism our allies, Human Rights, and Civil/Equal Rights!
Beyond Cynical	Thumbs down, there’s my vote.   Totally illogical, even in a close race your vote is still hundreds or thousands away from making a difference. Does he even believe what he is saying?
Laurence	1:18 “You remember those hearings where Congressmen were asking Mark Zuckerberg questions like they’ve never used the Internet? That’s because they haven’t.”  *I LOL’d.*
rick lomar	He could have ended the wars and given everyone healthcare while Democrats controlled all branches of government. Why didn't he? Also, why did he bail out the crooks on Wall Street? Hope and change ... lol
BlueMorningStar	Alright Dad, I'll go out and vote, GEEZE. Can I have my iPad back now?
PicklesRTasty	>lol look at how relaxed and cool I am, I'm just like you fellow kids!  Fuck off
TheLastInferno	Those neck exercises tho
roveltin	worst president ever...
Abundantia	Does he have any advice for voter suppression?
Jacob Perez	😥😢😢😔
John Semper	Yeah because the only thing that matters is the color of your skin and the sex of the person. God I hate democrats your all racist and sexist. Yeah and Obama backed a socialist who doesnt understand how the minimum wage is calculated. Yeah the gender pay gap is a lie I can mathematically disprove the gender pay gap. Oh and none of your suggestions on gun violence would have stopped a single shooting. Your the worse president in the history of the United states.
1000101	ugh, "there are some people who think women shouldn't get equal pay for equal work".  I'm calling bullshit on this.  Name one person in any western nation that thinks this.  One.  I bet nobody can point to one person who ever said, "a woman should make less than a man for doing the exact same work."  The only "wage gap" that exists is artificial.  Men work more overtime and take less unpaid leave than women.  That's the only reason some women make less money than men for the same job.  But there are also a number of women who do put the time in and make the exact same amount as their male counterparts at the end of the year.  Stop using this as an argument.  It's a lie and you're stupid.
sng1867	If voting doesn’t matter, then why are Republicans so hellbent on suppressing votes?

theash3s	God Bless trump way better president !
70s80s	You heard Our President....NO EXCUSES!!!! VOTE!!!! 😍🇺🇸
PaiN ExoTiC	Voting is for the emotional, not logical. Logically, voting makes zero sense.
Don Anderson	We miss you Barack,hope to see you back in the White House with Michelle!
YouTube Moderator	I made sure I was first in line to vote for Senator John McCain!
musicalbacon2	You know, this Barrack guy would make a killer YouTube celebrity
Willem DaFuckedUp	Huge respect to this man.

Keef Fontaine	Please, everyone, vote.
FP Piroozian	I don’t live in the US & am not an America but I DO MISS this man.
Ein Gwi	Pathetic I love how they keep bringing him back everything  they hope he would make them win like in 2016
Neel L. Lumi	Why not add closed captions? Deaf people have to vote, too.
Darrell Allen	Obama is the textbook definition of a lame duck president. If you don’t believe me look at the difference of popular vote he  go into 2012 verse 2008.
The Scapegoat Mechanism	You don’t have to vote if you don’t want to. Don’t let ANYONE guilt trip you into converting to their party. You also have a right to complain no matter what you do. It’s called freedom of speech.
Karma Sauce	I love Obama.  And I miss him.  I'm not even American and I miss Barack and Michelle so, so much.  But Americans don't vote because of the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression and lobby groups (to name a few daunting and hopeless realities).  I vote in my both my provincial and federal elections, but if I lived in the United States, I probably wouldn't bother voting either.  I'd sooner march than vote.  As long as your politicians continue to be bought by corporations and special interest groups, voter confidence will continue to dwindle and you will be left with a majority of uneducated and blind faith voters.  Educated and engaged people know how the system works and I can't blame them for saving the time and effort...that's what a smart person would do.  Let me be clear, Americans are not apathetic.  They are disillusioned.  And for good reason.  But I'm still rooting for my neighbours to the south.  And I know Canada's government has its quirks...we still have a Queen as our head of state.  But holy sweet baby Jesus, you guys gotta get your political shit together.
Beta	If we want our votes to count in Presidential elections, we need to make the Electoral College go away.
uriarteh	I miss Obama 😭 But yes sir count me going to vote all blue. ✅
Lex Blazer	God, I miss him...he was up against a huge congressional wall, so he never became some big-accomplishing president...but at least he could talk.
muller3641	Great segment. Love you Barack. 🤘
Laurencio R	Now he was a real President!!! Not the embarrassing imposter we have now... smh
Jima Alex	How did we go from this humble, eloquent, intelligent and thoughtful President to the orange Marmalote imbecile  we have in the office now!!!

Lucky24	So old, sad, weak, and pathetic. So glad this manipulative liar with delusions of granduer and a misplaced savior complex is no longer president. #RedTide
bixchick007	Smart man, sorely missed.
Doug Clement	I'm too apathetic to bother voting.
Julian Birch	Thanks, especially about the Googling the candidates thing.  It may be harder to find stuff on the most local races that lack in news coverage, but for US Congress, Senate, and the major statewide elections you're bound to come up with something on at least the top candidates from a major party.  If there's a really interesting Independent or Third Party candidate running, then there may even be one or two web pages or news articles out there dedicated to them.

John Miranda	The Republicans own the voting machine tabulating servers. When you own the electronic voting machines you own the vote
Allen Waker	I remember when we had a president who ramped up the wars in the Middle East expanded NSA spying overthrew democratically elected leaders
madhavyu	That's my President not the current impostor in the White House.
SCE 2045	Man I miss that guy, sure, I didn't like a couple of things about his term, but goddammit we weren't the laughing stock of the World
kedar nadkarny	I think attn did a good job editing Obama's long pauses. Hehe. (Obama is the best)
Folarin Osibodu	pls . come back. class beyond class.
Alex Noble 2002	Listening to Barack Obama speak is a breath of fresh air....I miss this man
Robert Lynch	Shut the fuck up you dog eating marxist sub human piece of fecal debris.
NumChuck Lee	maybe he should have done what he said he would do - remember the public option - remember his statements about "mandatory health insurance doesn't make sense" ? thats my excuse for not voting.
James MG	Can anyone else besides the brain-dead Trumpers imagine the orange con-man doing a similar public service announcement encouraging people, especially young people, to vote? Obama used plain simple language and facts, easy to understand answers and sprinkled in some humor. Trump couldn't get through three of the reasons to vote that Barack Obama did because there were no references, accolades, praises, admiration's or kudos to Trump in that four and a half minute message and Trump couldn’t go that long without having his snowflake ego massaged. Barack Obama, you sir, are sorely missed by the sanest among us. Sometimes we don’t know what we had till it’s gone.
Andrew Garcia	Obama is a prime example of what we call a PENDEJO!
karen taylor	I'm voting blue! We love you Barak Obama! We will vote blue and make a change for the country we Love! American deseves better then Trump! Vote blue no excuses, we will take back our country!
Michele Mill	Please come back. ❤️
Jess Stuart	How about... 1.  My district boundaries have been redrawn, so my candidate does not stand a chance. 2. They closed my polling location and now I have to drive 10 extra miles to vote. 3. My name was removed from the voting rolls because it had a hyphen in it. 4. The electronic voting machine I will use has been hacked by the Russians.   Getting Angry Yet?  Well, do something about it, and don't wait until election day to vote this November.  If Republicans get their way, this could be America's last free and fair election. Don't sit on the sidelines and watch our democracy get flushed down the toilet.
DDIFCC	Things used to be so much more enjoyable, before the fake Cheeto came to town🤔😏😒 Wishing us all a better reality, and I mean everyone 🙏
BETTERWORLD SGT0589	This is A Real  President!
Olivia P	#2 It isn't about labels/characteristics.  It is about policies.  No one I could vote for this november shares any of my core beliefs.
fernando escalante	We got this!!! Come on people in Georgia watching this, Texas, vote BLUE!
stretch54	I voted today. I didn't vote for one fukin' republican. As long as congress is going to vote straight party,  I may as well do it too.
Last Lime	Vote the same.... Vote democrat.... Vote democrat nazi party.... Paid for by racists.
positronlaserforce	Prez obama. Did you rag on pokemon? I will vote to make pokemon a national treasure
A. G.	So I'm not understanding why this video has any thumbs down... it's all pretty sound advice...
Kurleigh Martin	I miss this man so much! A decent, competent, and compassionate man!
Gavin	It's Barry the Pedo Barry like Hot dogs.
enigma mist	*former*
Inge Justa van der Helm	You want people to vote? Give them a platform. The DNC has no platform at all!
lagrange777able	Almost fucking cried seeing Obama again. Cant believe its only been like, what, 1,5 years or so? Feels like an eternity without him.
Marc Scarpelli	Funny to read the snowflake rank & file Rep's, hair-on-fire, frothing at the mouth against a true patriot -- simply because he doesn't have an (R) after his name.  They fail to understand the meaning of true Leadership.  I did not agree with every one of his policies, but he was a Statesman...and he never promoted violence against your fellow American.
CARTOONIVERSE1	I think the *Academy* in Hollyweird should give this guy an *Oscar* for *Best Performance* in a global scam.
PikaXRich	I don't care if Obama doesn't care about Pokémon. I'll still vote for Democrats cuz I had enough of Donald Dump. he needs to be flushed.
Fahad Khalid	Coolest guy on earth. Period.
Commander Shepard	Damn Trump makes this guy look like a homeless drunk.And I like the fact how he insists on the importance of Voting Democrat than voting as a whole.
Eriq Brown	just want to vouch for what this guy with the ipad said -- google *IS* easy to use! i didn't vote in the last elections.... and i didn't know much about my local candidates in this cycle, so i looked up background info on every single person running for office in my state, across all parties. i discovered a couple candidates i really liked, who i hadn't known about before. AND i realized one of the people i probably would have voted for bc of party affiliation is actually a major tool who seems to only act in their own interest. all this from a bit of googlewhacking -- and it took me about 20 minutes total, maybe 25. so don't take this ipad guy's word for it, listen to me, because i'm really smart... in fact, i might become this nation's first black president one day. so just get informed, and GO VOTE!
Octavian	"President Obama Doesn't Have Time For These 7 Excuses Not To Vote" - he didn't have time to improve our country either.
Copyrightbreaker22	First they wanted us to Pokémon go to the poll. Now they don’t care about Pokémon at all. Make up your damn mind xd. In all seriousness it’s a good video.
Kaibo101	Whoa. There is nothing wrong with scrolling through my finished dinners. In a generation that constantly eats out, I made something. I took the time to grow my own food and then prepared something that is good for my body. I walk away with the feeling of some form of accomplishment and connection to the generations before me. Your wife tackled obesity issues in children....shouldn't you support people making their own food????
Fredroks	Bath House Barry was the best foreign born homosexual jihadist to ever serve as President!
Condor Boss	#2 I don't want to be 'lead'. #3 Nice slice of ageism there, Mr. O.  #5 There are candidates who think socialism works. And that Castro, Che and Chavez were good guys.
MsNadua	We miss you!
Big Mike	Why doesnt this fucking piece of shit go get hit by a car. People dont have to vote. You and your asshole Democrats had most people in the cemeteries voting. So take yourself and your ape and finally get lost
ThatsPlanePokey	Obama is my favorite it was a tragedy when he had to leave.
m. mck	someone who cares & educates,  hope this message changes our leaders that are in now & we  put in honest caring leaders. # helpAmericahavebetterleaders.
Thomas Rittenhouse	@Barack Obomber , Give back your Nobel Peace Prize , Give The American People Back Their 5.2 million families like mine back their homes & not your campaign donors on #WallStreet , Walk with the striking teachers , nurses , hotel workers that you promised to help .  You laid the groundwork for your 3rd term with $Hillary & the #DeadDNC and how did that work out for you Obomber ?  You did this to the country and now you want the american people to clean up your mess just like when you helped screw #BernieSanders ,,,, F*ck You Barck Obama and your #FakeAssProgressive Corportist War Pig Ways ,,,,, You Fuckin Neo-Liberal piece of shit . I was stupid enough to vote for you in 2008 what makes you think anything you say now matters to Poor People Like Me Who You Helped Rob By Bailing Out The Bankster You Fuckin Liar !  Oh by the way you backstabber me & my mentally challenge 25 y/o son will be homeless for the 8 time since 2008 because of you and your leadership ,,,,, thanks ass hole !
c431inf 11b	He is still doing nothing 😂
Wectum Wecker	God I miss this man.
Becker289	Trump 2020! 🇺🇸
Julia Nadeau	Excuse #8: I'm sick and fucking tired of politicians rigging elections in their favor with gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc... and when they get into office, they end up supporting the corporate agenda over what's best for workers, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. Case in point: the Democratic Primaries of 2016. What, are you surprised that some of us are still pissed off about this? Damn right we are! I was a Democrat since the first day I could vote. And yet, despite having grown up as a Child of Reaganomics, despite their numerous attempts to vote away my access to the Means of Survival, despite their numerous attempts to legislate me out of existence (as a transwomen), it wasn't Republicans who radicalized me into being a Socialist. Why not? Cause I expect that sort of evil and corruption from them. But the Democrats, I thought for years that they were better than that. In 2016, I watched the DNC and the DCCC try to ram Hillary Clinton down our throats... a candidate who loses popularity everytime she opened her mouth, a candidate who was so corporate that I could scarcely tell the difference between her policies and the bullshit politics of Reagan I grew up with! In one key state after another, I saw the DNC meddling and engaging in all sorts of political fuckery, like voter suppression and poll closings. I saw their hand in sudden rule changes and collusion with MSM to shut out Bernie and prop up Trump as a "pied piper candidate". I still remember having to watch Trump's empty podium on MSNBC while Bernie was holding a record-breaking rally in Phoenix, AZ. And you, Barry, YOU were complicit in all this, in both your support of Debbie Wassermann-Schultz and her tactics, and your continuous support of a candidate that did NOT have the mandate of Democratic Voters. That said, I still voted in the general election DESPITE all this. True, I didn't vote for the candidates of either party, but went third party (because at least the Greens weren't wholly owned by the corporations). But I can understand why so many pissed-off Democrats chose not to vote. I voted out of sheer outrage, in a pyrrhic attempt to show the candidates in question the level of contempt with which I viewed them. You, Barry, sat by and let the unravelling of our democracy take place. You have no grounds to lecture us all on the importance of voting. I left the Democratic Party because of the blatant corruption of the DNC. I am a Socialist because I watched democracy get used and abused by those who swore to uphold it.
Tobi Makkura	How many of his speech pauses did the editor have to deal with 😂?
Hamfists Man	I miss this guy.
timber_beast	So sad how far America has fallen so quickly since Obama.
Harlequin Cyning	I don't appreciate voting for the lesser of two evils with a gun to my head.   Install a voting minimum, say 33% of eligible voters. If the threshold is not met as happened in Venezuela, a snap election is held cross country. Every elected or appointed official tossed and their position up for new blood.   In theory, gives disenfranchised voters a voice and acts as a backstop to corrupt authoritarian regimes, like the US.
CandyGirlタ♡高橋	OBAMA!!! 🙌🏻🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🇺🇸💙🙌🏻
Ben Gilbert	I'm voting Republican
MickyAvStickyHands	Never trust a young conservative or an old liberal. One of them is soulless and the other is a grade A moron.
elijah mikle	Insane!  An ex president with so much faith in the people that he believes if we get out vote things will be better.  All I heard was reasons to vote.  No partisan BS.  Well played Obama, you served us well for 8 years, but your time is done.
Ash Doodge	No I'm all in Trump 20/20 and whoever he says vote for.
Ron Roberts	This man a charlatan , a Fraud did nothing when he was in office but bombed  7 different Countries  & violated Habeas Corpus  -Trump is Americans first
Working Class Gotham	The most disingenuous neo-liberal Democrat - ever to sit in the White House and screw the working class for eight years. Go sky dive with Richard Branson and have a cerebral circle jerk with Hillary Goldman Clinton, sell out. You made this mess, Wall Street boy. This ad is so offensive: conflating the civic duty of voting with voting for Democrats. Our white girl degreed class is so transparent.
Michael Burgess	This is the same 'hopey, changy' guy who railed against corporate America until he actually got the top job. After which, he  immediately appointed the likes of Summers and Geitner to solve the financial crisis. The same guys whose policies caused the crash in the first place. After that he printed money and saved Wall Str. not Main Str. He then refused to prosecuted the warmongers and torturers of the neo-con cabal that led us the Iraq. But he did find the time and energy to prosecute whistle blowers. Black Lives Emerged during his time and to top it all, he backed HRC in 2016 and his legacy of corporate pandering brought us Trump. But of course he can always blame Republicans for being obstructive (a convenient EXCUSE). So FU Obama and your patronising crap. Its no wonder people gave up on the political system after 8 years of your witty, smooth talking liberal hypocrisy. At least with Trump you know you're deep shit.
JCTJR98	Keep talking Mr Obama and reminding us why the American people repudiated your policies in 2016. Its feels so great to finally see our country  not be taken advantage of by the rest of the world and have a growing prosperous middle class; especially blue collar manufacturing working American's.  Oh remember the threat from ISIS, missels being launching from North Korea, Iran's ability to fund terrorists and taking hostages our sailors, China's out right economic warfare and your Russians friends taking over other countries territory? Well that has ALL stopped because we now have a United States President who keeps our country safe and cares for working American's!!  So please keep making public aperances and also tell your friend Hillary Clinton to do the same; especially when she defends her husband's sexual offenses. Thank you.
emacicc	I love him,but damn,8 years in the white house really did a number on him,e was so young and fresh
Anonymous Doe	Lol its so weird how he looks from camera to camera. Like it wasn't edited smoothly at all
Jimmi Stone	Daddyyyy
teamleader2010	He doesn't have time for the truth either.
pforce9	Not a fan of Barack Obama. He spent eight years kissing republican asses, gave us Romneycare, a republican health care plan,  was too weak to exercise his supreme court nomination, made the Bush tax cuts permanent,  fired Shirley Schorrod because Bret Breitbart disapproved,  left Susan Rice to swing in the breeze, abandoned the Standing Rock Sioux to the mercy of private police brutality, swept the Flint Michigan water crisis under the rug let the wall street swindlers off the hook and is responsible for that little punk, rat bastard Tom Perez being head of the DNC. Any questions?
Walt Schmidt	He's a funny Kenyan clown. BACK to the circus with ya....
Rin Y	This should be trending instead of some dumb 💩 like fake mustache?  makeup? whatever. Spread the words, you guys!!!!   #VoteBlue
Ash Pro	Can't say how much i miss him and took him for granted when he was president.
Blackvoid2me	You never know how much you miss someone until they leave. I miss obama
leebog31	The king NPC is back.
Chuey Lopez	I miss him so fukn much. I don’t believe in some of the policy’s he approved but he was the best president ever. Now on another note. I won’t vote because the USA is a piece of shit now with both political parties at each other’s throat. There are more than 52 political parties and my vote won’t count cuz I’m voting independent and majority of the ppl in America are going to vote republican or Democrat so there you have it. Miss you Obama.
Sean Lykes	Shut up Obama. Your game is old and ain't nobody buying anymore.   Dont worry I'm going to vote . But I assure you it wont be Democrat that i vote. It will be Republican and trump for the rest of my life.    You don't care about working people Obama.  Shut up!!! And I'm black so dont try it. Still like Michelle though. Dont know why she is with your uncle Tom ass.
Bloo95	God, I miss him.
Some dude	look at all the useless eater NPCs boot licking this trotsky communist
Luis Grullon	That's right boys and girls, voting is the only thing that's gonna get us out of this twilight zone year
Justin S	Okay, but why didn't you crack down on white collar crime or prosecute any of the architects of the Iraw war?
Anubha Das	Google is super easy to read 😂😂
Foothills Trading Post	obozo didn't have time for a lot of things like stimulating the economy, creating job's, destroying ISIS, fighting illegal immigration, supporting our Police and Military, addressing the 7K black on black murders in his home city of chicago,  negotiating better trade deals.....  other than FUCK UP, exactly what did the son of a bitch do ???    He, along with the rest of the dipshitocrats did 1 thing right...... they elected TRUMP !!!
Roland Deschain	Isn't this Election Interference??? Obama just loves meddling. Ask him about how the CIA fucked with the 2012 French election.
blablabla80872	0:46 a serious question and i think it shows how Obama answers it. He doesn’t talk about relating to idea’s he talks about relating to your race or gender. IM A WOMAN SO I MUST VOTE FOR WOMEN. IM BLACK SO I MUST VOTE FOR BLACK PEOPLE.  That logic is whats wrong with the Democrats. Kanye doesnt agree with your views? Then he loses his blackness. Its that racism that still exists in the democratic party and the leaders still show it.
Elise C	Great video!!!!
James Martin	... Vote & Vote Early !!!
Harry Morgan	Who in hell cares what this loud-mouthed leftist lapdog obama  has time for?  And by the way, he's not president anymore. I know he's slow to learn that lesson. Perhaps someone should beat it into him.  Any former president with any class would step aside, maintain a noble silence, and allow the incoming president to do his job. But not this narcissistic, self-righteous, sanctimonious rabble rouser. He's been trying to undermine an elected president ever since inauguration day. And we're getting a bit weary of listening to his stupid diatribes. One of these days, someone will shut him up, permanently.
Oresti Ismaili	He just says pokemon?
blue4me43	Thanks, Our Very Favorite President Barack Obama. We all miss you so Please Come back and make DC our Home. We will Vote Blue this Nov, 2020 and 2022.
TheSnowFoxParty	I registered to vote a few weeks ago lol
Master Pole	Obviously he does have time 😅
Barack Obama	Hello my fellow Americans! IM BACK!!! Go out and Vote!
Aaron R.	Okay slave
Tyler	This is all his fault
maglen69	There are times in that video he looks like he really doesn't want to be there.
Adam Alkhafaji	They call it trump derangement syndrome I call it post Obama depression 😢 miss having an intellectual with values as president
tyro244	:: the old man asks :: What's Koochella?
Mat H	Excuse 8 I am Puerto Rican and a literal second class citizen with no vote or real representatives.  Statehood. Demand it from Congress
David Dutton	Trump is terrified about the midterms because he's only thinking one thing: If the Democrats take control, the first thing they're going to do is try and impeach him. Good. I hope he's right, and I hope they eviscerate him.
Geek The Girl	I know you had your faults, but I really fucking miss you! It was nice to have someone with a brain in the Oval Office.
Jo G	<3
Jared Reid	Corporatists have no right to call out voters who are undecided, why don't you go crawl under a rock obummer
BLT4LIFE	"You wouldn't let your grandparents pick your playlist." I actually would.
Lost Frame	2:32 Take notes kids 😂
Dattucha	You get a president in your studio and THIS is the crap script you give him?  Devoid of any decent jokes and a video title that begs not be clicked on?  Way to go ATTN
Philipp Süßmann	I miss him so much.
African Rule	Thank you so much "PRESIDENT" Obama. I am honored to say you were my first vote ever in my young life. And we miss you SIR. Very much.
Randy Johnson	Its so sad and pathetic how the worst president in US history, having been humiliated and stripped of any and all relevance, is trying sooooo hard to be noticed again.  I am embarrassed for him.
Kevin Slater	Don’t vote. Please don’t vote. We need more oligarchs and out of touch old white men in charge.
catcherboy96	This entire video enrages me because obama is one of the biggest reason my generation is disenfranchised to vote
Carmel Sileo	He was not my favorite prez, but I have to say, this was excellent!!! I'm away from my home state and voting absentee ballot, never missed one yet...so vote and VOTE BLUE
Robert Webb	I never voted and I'm still not gonna even though penndot registered me as a democrat when I specifically told them not to register me at all it seems like the government dose what it wants anyway so why do they need me when Philadelphia will just say I voted because it's all a hustle it's all fixed and I don't care because they won't dare look out for a poor white boy from Kensington so fuck it I'm gonna get drunk and watch you all get played enjoy your jury duty
Gwendolyn Williams	My President Barack Obama: A highly intelligent, Capable, Articulate, Polite Caring Man. Experience Former Public Servant, Fought for Social Justice.  Vote Blue.
Captain Obvious	Took 4 of my Republican friends to register to vote, they all are voting for Beto. Dag nabbit
Anthony Mcqueen	God i miss Obama a man with class, intelligence, integrity and respects the sanctity of marriage.   He wasnt perfect, but he was and is miles ahead of what we have now in the white house.   There was a time i was proud of my president and country. Not anymore that died in Jan 2017.  Obama was a true leader enough said.  I can careless what you haters think or say about me or this man come at me ot says more about yourself.
David Hendrickson	Now we need ones of the other four! I don't think our current commander in chief is really in the jokes business though. Just roasts and trolling.  Also, I'd really like to see the classiest, coolest version of Trump that he could possibly muster up. That would be interesting.
Pedro Kantor	All this Obama dick-riding in the comments shows that some people really learned nothing from his presidency.
peter chow	So I heard that you had two rallies and only a handful people showed up. I wonder why.
Anthony	I vote in my underwear, with google open and I google everything. I read the ballot blue book each year, this year I am reading it to some friends and going to help explain what stuff is.
Philippe Arquie	How do we get people to "Pokemon Go to the polls".  How do you do fellow kids?
NCState863	Obama lost the House Senate White house and supreme court from 2009-2016
Karen M.	Gosh I love that guy.  Listen here and do what he says!
flea10x6	If you do not vote, you have no right to complain. Not voting is ceding all decisions to those who do vote.
James Berryhill	I miss you Mr. President.
Ken Of Darkness	Here is my first criteria for a vote for a candidate. Can't be corrupt.
So WhoIsMilton	The One person in this world that I don't like more than Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton is Obama and his Lame SNL one liners that don't hit . . .
Frieda A	Mr. President, allow me to answer #3. America, if your vote doesn't matter, why do they work so hard to suppress it?
Mary Lincoln	Obama and the American Media IS WORKING WITH THE DEEP STATE...TO TAKE THIS COUNTY DOWN...
doedecaheedron	Trump can't afford the class Obama has.
Phil Rabe	So refreshing to hear complete sentences from a president again! About 20 years ago I switched to vote by mail and couldn't think of going back to the old way with hackable voting terminals. [I don't mail my ballot, there is a drop box at City Hall]
TrueHero123	The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes because our 'democratic' system is a vestige of slavery (electoral college). There are fairer elections in war torn Afghanistan than the US.  That being said, you should always vote, in every election. I became a US citizen in 2008 just so I could vote that year for president. My proudest moment as an American was when I voted for Ralph Nader in the 2008 presidential election.
Carlos Catalan	Best president ever !!!
Donald Smith	Love this man; even more so now
Fredrick Cranrenbury	What's this guy's name again?  So forgettable......All those great achievements....  Like a child who's balloon has floated away....  MAGA Bitches...
Shitstirrer	Love the video but that turning to the camera was awkward.
kevinalvarado	How about the 8th excuse: Democrats are corporate puppets just like Republicans and neither party is advancing policies like universal healthcare, cutting military spending, Universal Basic Income, etc.
Anthony Gatchalian	hey ex prez... shut up about photos of the amazing food I prepare. Sounds like you have a shitty interest in the beauty of food FYI  I vote and I voted for you. The food thing is off limits...dummy
Jeff Stewart	I like his response to #2. So your idea of choosing a candidate is based on identity politics.
LadyMaltese	I miss Obama at the helm. I actually enjoy voting in person because it gives me a chance to meet with my voting neighbors. It doesn't take that long, about 15 minutes, and l get the "I voted" sticker and bragging rights. Honestly, if you have a hard time spending a little time exercising your voting privileges after people have actually died for them maybe you should take a serious look at your priorities.
Chuck Ragland	Listen to this people! Vote vote vote democrat.
Ben the Slug	Come baaaaaaack pleeeeeaaaase
Kevin Jacobs	This is all he’s going to do to get people to vote. He knows he’s the kiss of death to democrats , he lost a total of over 1 k for democrats country wide when he was whiner in chief. You’ll also notice that the Clintons are not campaigning for democrats either , odd since democrats claim to love them 😝. Trump 2020 !
Lisa Wood	So true about not letting my Gma or Mom pick my playlist, using google and do u know your address. This cracked me up!!!!
D Storm	He wants illegal immigrants to vote too.
JohnnyBoy3000	I would vote if I was American.
cal blank	when Obama mark Zackerburg  comment is so funny
Tertiary Adjunct	Bush captured and tortured. Obama just killed.  Wake up folks... you've been bamboozled thinking there's a diff between the parties.
Felix Vasin	sounds like Obama... did they put a stunt double in or is Obama gettin old?   not looking forward to the three year span when all my hair turns white.
Ripley King	This is just too good. A president who can speak. What we need more of these days. Share. Vote.
Marinara Gaming	voting blue  this one's for you
TheWedabest	You had your 8 years Obama.  Yeah I believed in that whole "change".  You just fucked up things even more.  I DON'T VOTE.  Why should I vote when your rich celebrity buddies have your ear, like trump's family has his ear.  All you politicians are the same.  Just makes me sick.
vulpix	I’m offended and I find this a Pokémon 😡
dukky fuzz	Much luv and respect prez Obama
No Shit	Boy I miss that man so much! Go VOTE on November 6th to get to have a cool cat like him (well almost) in 2020!
Bung Kusi	Vote!!
Marty Schrader	As always, The King of Klass Kills It. Why couldn't we have him for another few terms? Oh, yeah -- 22nd.
B H	Please just shut the fuck up obama
Trump Gozinya	Take off, sissy.
Joao Santos	Fantastic person! Easy to understand and relate to Obama.
Broken Deity	Obama is a living refutation as to why voting matters.
Esmeralda Shepherd	I like Obama so much that I'm not even that he doesn't care about Pokémon
Alan Parker	Obama Says "WE NEED MORE NEOLIBERALS JUST LIKE ME"
Jacob Serrano	A citizen who doesn’t vote isn’t a citizen.
Debra Legorreta	STOP Obama!  Obama is the problem, not the solution.    No more word games and moving speeches. We do NOT need “Hope and Change.” Broken promises with nothing tangible behind them, but fancy words with no meaning.    We need results.  No deals with the other side.  No give and take that sets the stage for future rip offs as Obama did.  We need Real Progress.     Here's just SOME of the criminal filth Obama and the so-called “New Democrats” (aka corporate dems) accomplished and how that opened the door for Trump and his criminal regime to grow and fester:  The abolition of welfare: no social security, no medicare/medicaid, no food stamps, etc., The deregulation of the financial system,  The illegal attacks on Syria,  The illegal attacks on Yemen, The bailout of Wall Street, ($700 Billion TARP), The $4.7 Trillion “Quantitative Easing” handout to the financial sector, The crackdown on whistleblowers (e.g. Snowdon, others), The crackdown on the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, belies Obama’s “Clean Power Plan” was mere lip service, The crackdown on Occupy, The attack on freedom of the press, saying “reporter's privilege” does not exist (Jim Risen case)  The refusal to pardon whistleblowers (e.g. Snowdon, Van Buren, more), The slashing of wages for autoworkers,  The appointment of Tom Wheeler, an industry insider, to head the FCC (thence Ajit Pai),  The Flint Michigan lead in the water cover up, outright betraying the citizens of Flint, Drone-missile warfare with no congressional oversight,  The destruction of Libya,  The build-up of NSA mass surveillance, The expansion of US military bases to 80+ countries,  The weakening on the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act to allow the use military force domestically The military coup in Honduras ousting “Mel” Zelaya,  The murder of Berta Cáceres, Mass deportations, more than in any other period in US history,  Mass incarcerations,  CIA Operation Timber Sycamore in Syria, The parliamentary coup in Brazil, ousting Dilma Rousseff,  Blocking Argentina’s loan at the Inter-American Development Bank and the WB, leading to regime change The expansion of the Endless War in Afghanistan,  The murder of an old, sick captive purely for political purposes, Manipulating the OAS to overturn the Haiti elections, threatening to deny post-earthquake aide, leading to regime change and mass disenfranchisement, The expansion of the strategic nuclear weapons program,  The kill list The expansion of covert military operations to over 70 countries, The expansion of the AUMF The revolving door: The appointment of former Eli Lilly executive, Alex Azar, to head of HHS The revolving door: The lucrative position at Lockheed Martin for former DHS head Jeh Johnson The revolving door: Geitner to head Mariner Finance, a firm that preys on the poor. The revolving door: Mary Shapiro from the SEC to board of directors of Morgan Stanley The end of habeas corpus, detentions without trial and arrests without cause  The failure to stop Russia for meddling in the 2016 Presidential elections The failure to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 Presidential elections, (what got Trump in trouble in Helsinki . . . they looked the other way when Obama did the same thing) The missing $10 Trillion; concerted Bush-Obama-Trump tax cuts resulted in the loss of $10T from the public funds of which $2T went directly to the 1% The passing of PROMESA Act to protect Wall Street’s interests in Puerto Rico at the expense of local sovereignty: an outside board rules over the island, effectively PR is now a colony,   The appointment of Arne Starkey Duncan as Sec. of Education: Common Core Exam, public schools replace with charter schools  -- so-called ‘militarization of education” that enabled De Vos, NOT standing up to climate-change deniers; NOT standing up to science deniers; NOT definitively supporting the Water Protectors and shutting down DAPL -- thus opening the door to Trump’s staunch denialism and the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement,  Allowing Ag industry lobbyist, CropLife, to kickoff the EPA panel Dr. Peter Infante; the panel was about to investigate Monsanto’s glyphosate-based flagship product, RoundUp, The unwillingness to investigate or prosecute Bush Administration officials for warrantless wiretapping and torture, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqU9UhjPOtk “we need to look forward,” The continuation of warrantless wiretapping and torture,   . . . every week we discover yet more Obama-era/ Obama-enabled shenanigans!  Obama basically made possible the Trump wrecking ball.  Talk about collusion.  Talk about treason.  That’s the real collusion.  That's the real treason.  Our struggle is less and less with Russia and more and more with Goldman Sachs.   Ever wonder why Obama has such a contagious smile?  Turns out he’s laughing all the way to the bank.    So what’s next for Goldman Sachs, Obama’s paymasters?   IMHO, The old “hope and change” deception wagon; specifically, the hijacking of Universal Basic Income movement, the UBI movement.  Wall Street’s Goals?  Restore Obama’s standing among democrats,  Shut out progressives, Keep UBI from actually happening, or take the credit if it does, so progressives don’t.   *** Have you no shame? I have no idea who you are and why you are endorsing a war criminal.  How did you get my email?  I want nothing to do with you and deeply resent the day your group decided to endorse Obama. This is attack on progressives and on American values.  The Trump Putin summit in Helsinki which so many found so shameful would not have been possible if it were not true that there is a moral equivalence between the Russian authoritarian regime  and our government which gives lip service to our "democracy" and "core values."  Thanks to Obama and presidents before him, we have no moral high ground.  And you want to celebrate this debacle by bringing back one the chief culprits of our national humiliation?  Shame on you.  You stand for everything evil the USA has done.  Most shameful is that all along you talked about our ideals, our values, our freedoms.  Everyone knows this is just chatter, not just because of Helsinki, but because everything that came before that.    But for Obama, Trump would not have happened.  The Republicans are equally evil.  Here’s Kevin Drum’s list of GOP misdeeds:  “As a sort of PS to my post yesterday about the decay that’s overtaken the Republican Party, I’d like to make clear just how long this has been brewing. I know this is hardly news to anyone who reads this blog, but as I approach my 60th birthday I can say that half my life has now been marked by Rush Limbaugh, the Drudge Report, Newt Gingrich, the Vince Foster suicide, Whitewater, the Rose law firm, Filegate, the Christmas card list scandal, Fox News, Monica Lewinsky, impeachment, the Florida recount, Swift boating, the GOP’s partywide effort to suppress black votes via photo ID laws, birtherism, the unanimous Republican rejection of the 2009 stimulus, Benghazi, Emailgate, Merrick Garland, and now the endless haze of racism, bigotry, and corruption surrounding Donald Trump. This is very much a non-exhaustive list. But every one of these things is either a baseless “scandal,” an example of ethical rot, or part of a deliberate media effort to lie and mislead. These are the highlights of the Republican Party over the past three decades. No political party with a rap sheet like this deserves to be walking around free. ”  Source: https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/08/30-years-of-moral-decay-a-short-history-of-the-republican-party/?utm_source=mj-newsletters&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=in-the-mix-2018-08-11
JJ Walter	Maybe we would get more voters if it was clicking likes and dislikes.   I wonder if there will ever be internet voting.
Yvonne Amaral	Love love love Obama ❣️
Poopergeist	Excuse 1: The problem is that every time we try to vote people in who advocate good changes, they either turn out to be lying corporatist pieces of shit like you who aren't interested in the changes we need, or they're cheated out of the election by people like you. You want more people to vote, give us choices that aren't complete horseshit.  Excuse 2: This is a dodge, and you fucking know it. It's not just about representation of minorities. It's about representation of our interests.  Excuse 3: This one I actually agree is kinda dumb. Like even if you're living in a red state and want to vote blue or vice versa, your state isn't going to change unless people like you get off their asses and vote.  Excuse 4: Nobody is making that argument  Excuse 5: No, fuck that. I don't want to be responsible for voting someone like that in because I'm uninformed. Though admittedly, with cases such as yourself, values can be hard to discern. You presented yourself as someone who was gonna bring change, and then you wound up being a status quo president who bent over for the medical insurance industry when while campaigning you advocated free healthcare.  Excuse 6: Yeah, this one I'll give him.  Excuse 7: Yeah, this one I'll give him too.
ThePipt	Real President of USA
Jane Leelavathi	We had such a cool/intelligent president.
Cliff Roberson	None of those reasons even come close to why I will choose NOT to vote!
The Jackanapes	FFS Obama...  I can't vote until 22 Oct at earliest here.  You got me, you bastard, OK?  I hadn't voted since 1996. But I voted in primaries this year, first time since.  OK?  And I'm voting in *every subsequent election I can*  - OK?  YOU ARE RIGHT, are you happy now?    I FEEL BAD about my cynicism from 1996 - 2018.  I do.  I'm sorry.  What will it take to get you off my back about it? Try to get more people to vote?  OK I have done that too.  To the best of my ability. I've lost friends over it.  You happy?  No?  Fine.  On this issue you're right though.
Michael RCH	How is this not trending? Miss you man.
Christina Johnston Pérez	Thank you dear Obama....Thank you.
BartJ583	#6 is heartbreaking. In Germany, for every election, every voter is sent a postcard reminding him of the date of the upcoming election and the address of his polling station. (It also contains the info you need to apply for an absentee ballot.) Why does the U.S. not have that?
Shanty Half Thick	*Wrong Move there tryng to be relevant because of pokemon 👌*
Homing Fung	No time to vote? In Canada employers must grant employees 3 hours off work to vote on election day. All level of government elections nationwide.  Apparently in the US, time off to vote is subject to the employer in many states and state law does not require employers to grant time off to vote for employees.
Jorge Arturo Rincon Arenas	PFFFFFFFFFffffffffffffffffff... go home
Winston Harrison	We are now dealing with a new generation of leaders - the Baby Boomers and later. Yes, it is now more difficult to find good leaders to vote for. We need to lower our standard or vote for the lesser evil. It is the new reality. Staying away from the polls does not help.    Please vote.
Ramon Mendoza Nunez	Obama I miss you
Aquabone 81	Considering nothings been done about gerrymandering, tampered voting machines, voter purging ect.... I'm very disappointed to hear this disingenuous crap come out of your mouth Mister president.
Nackdad	POS neoliberal says what?
k96	Barack Obama was a real president!
Primalxbeast	#6 isn't that easy if you don't have a permanent address. I live in my car and "random parking lot" isn't accepted as an address for voter registration.
dadohead	G.O.A.T.
Luxsenk	Traduccion en español para el publico hispano. Por favor! Esta muy interesante! Este hombre es GENIAL!
perry mahaney	Obama sucks ASSHOLE!!!!!
sunnylilme	I miss obama. TONS of my friends arent voting...dont care. They're minorities and women even. Been arguing till Im blue in the face, they dont care, not political they say.
Wahkeena Sitka	i miss this man.
Laura Eager	Great video and I’m mailing my form for an absentee ballot. Miss you Obama!!
inthewayoftruth	Nintendo fans triggered lol
Lucius Augustus	Listen Obama I don't like this Pokemon hate
FAKE RAYBAN's	For 1 thing he is not a President he never was just a Gayboy WHORE PUPPET put in place by ROTHSCHILD  not going to watch the vid have no interest in his bull shit Propaganda OR DONG PLIMP/
Jacob Custer	This guy is so cool... wow.
VianneyCreates	Preach!
Vargoroth	The thing I like most about this video is that Obama sort of confesses that he was full of shit when he was president. There's a line he says:  "For way too long politicians haven't been representative of America as a whole. But that's changing THIS YEAR." (@0:50)  So... It wasn't changing when YOU were running for office in 2012? That whole "we will change" rhetoric was bullshit? It's only six years later that politicians start representating the people who voted for them? Alright, good to know. Seriously, I don't get why this guy was such a popular president. What, he's chill and sauve and suddenly all of the corporate bullshit he did gets ignored? The dude was just another guy pretending to be an outsider who ended up being a mainstream president. Sound familiar to anyone?
Jason H.	Excuse 8: the US people are already overwhelmed by so much winning.
JT H	Poor Osama he just doesn't get it. You're old news, you fucked the country up and USA finally has a President who has a set of balls, like your husband Michael, and now the country is finally starting to come back around and the Dem's wanna fuck it all back up. Just come out of the closet, Osama, like you should have before and in this day and age you'll be greeted with open arms. Michael and you and your adopted girls can live a normal life.   I see all these floppy cocks on here commenting, finally came out of their safe space to be keyboard warriors. I guess the new term is "Soy Boys". How do ANY of you even call yourselves men? Well I guess in some you're not. Sad
Carlos Cunba	My favorite not to vote excuse would be the Democrats are KKK and Republicans are against KKK but Democrats supports KKK to vote for Republicans.
Spenser Walsh	this is gonna change everything
Cubonica	No. 8 - Be a legal citizen.
Matthew Vinson	Thank you #obama. I miss you.
EmeraldView	Thanks America's most recent real president.
Setokaiva	I love when he said "...This thing has Google. You can't use Google to look up people's beliefs?"  That, I think, is gonna make alot of people feel sheepish. xD
Getting Wet With Sharkie	I don't vote, ironically, because of Obama. A man who once promised "change" but failed to deliver and this happens time and time again with politicians on both sides. They'll say one thing and then when they get into power they do the complete opposite. Lets look at Obama as an example - he promised to: - Close Guantanamo Bay. - Secure US borders - Sign a universal healthcare bill - Restrict government wiretapping on US citizens - Repeal the tax cuts for the rich  - Withdraw troops from Iraq These are just the broken promises I can remember, I'm sure there are more. It goes to show that a politician's promise is an empty one.  I don't vote because I can't relate to the candidates. And by that I don't mean women, gay people, minorities and so on - that's all superficial bullshit. I want a candidate that will represent me with their policies, not their genitalia. Making bad Pokémon jokes doesn't make you relatable, it makes you a fucking jackass.  I don't vote because my vote doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because the system is set up to make it that way. We have the Electoral College, super-delegates, super-pacs, a two party system that ensures independent candidates don't have a chance in hell, and even within those two parties - the system can be rigged in favor of one candidate over another. All you need to do is look at what the DNC did to Bernie. They pushed him out in favor of Hilary Clinton, a candidate so bad she lost to Donald... Fucking... Trump.  Voting is a democratic right but so is choosing not to vote.
rapidroy7	Obama is there still 57 States ? Do you still stand behind your~' I Taught Frank Underwood Everything he Knows '~ Comment? Larry Sinclair Loves him some Obama?
ProtoMario	No please, don't let me down like that...
Vashaun Persaud	number 4 really pissed him off
William Drescher	Thanks.   Riffed on that one.  Here  https://photos.app.goo.gl/PFFE8DQDwM6SnYZLA
Angela Sanders	I love you, Obama! I miss you! Thanks for helping!
TranceElevation	Pathetic.
Slave Slave	Support u criminal s  Democrats & Republican s idiots & independent  Put more rapist & sex traffickers like USA
Robert Happ	This douche bag should have taken his own advice hahaha what a joke.
dee park	My personal excuse is: Obama.
Robert Kelly	Please vote this fall!  It is very important!!
Alexandre Silva de Andrade	I care about Pokémon. Fascist!!!
CastrovalleyLip Lip	Tick tock barry’ you changed the face of politics~ I’m WOKE and voted RED 🇺🇸 For Americans and America- in case you don’t know why- because I MATTER, even if you don’t! Get lost, stfu and sit down, quietly
Chris M	Obama, shut up you CIA plant pot. Your wife is more of a man than you. You almost destroyed America with your NWO policies paving the way for the witch to go to war with everyone and their dog while chipping away at peoples rights, freedoms and dismantling the constitution allowing communism and Islamic extremism to run wild before bowing down to the globalists due to uncontrollable civil unrest and conflicts abroad. Good job the people got wind of your sick agenda. So folks, if you want the new world order on your doorstep real soon then vote democrat.
Mandisa W	Nevermind Democrats & Republicans, the real struggle is between those who work to change the country and those who are too "checked-out" to even try. I've voted every election - State/Local, Federal, and special - since I turned 18, and I'm so tired of contemporaries blabbing about protests & petitions, but not putting their 'X' where it counts - the ballot box. Democracy is a "citizen-push" form of governance - Be the Change you want to see! #Vote20XX
Christ Aware	Well I share the same values as Jesus so that's my pick. But he is already on the throne so there's no need for me to vote. 💪💪
Phillip Wasden	He does this video because hes made to believe that talking to YouTube = talking to potential Democrat votes.  The fact is most of us just come here to hear him say he doesn't care about Pokemon.  The US is so polarized 99% of voters already know exactly how we will vote in midterms.
512BB	I misssssssssssssssssss you :-(
nail3r	"for too long, women haven't been representative in office".  You had 8 years Barack.
Lyme is Lame	“I don’t care about Pokémon” is the uncoolest thing he’s said. That’s how much it takes for this gem of a human to not be cool. Love you, Barry O. Great video. Miss you.
Eric Sharp	He's still president? Smh
Sir Winston Lennon	People voted... TRUMP WON!
Alberto David Vidal	Pokemon is awesome!! politics no!
HasanJF	Fuck you corporate establishment warmongering shill, why should I fucking take advice from you? You threw Bernie under the bus for the most corrupt Democrat ever b/c of her 70 year old wrinkly vagina who caused herself to lose to the orange buffoon. Fuck you corporate Democrats and fuck you GOP!
Dana Moonfire	Obama was the guy who abandoned the progressive base that got him elected and because of that the Democrats lost in the midterm. He had his chance to get out the vote but instead he made it worse. How much longer to we have to hear from this failure. I think it is a very risky strategy for him to be the face of the Democratic Party. That will only stir up Trump supporters even more.
RyoonZ Wu	Yes I'll vote Republican
Gail Beterbide	Dang, I miss that LEADER of calm, humor and reason.
timmothy58	hey...this is great...convinced me to vote red as red can be...thank...love...
deidara _	2:44 I call BS, give me ONE prominent candidate that says that. The pay gap BTW is complete nonsense, it's been a constitutional right since the 50's for women and men to be paid equally for equal work, the statistics that say otherwise aren't taking decisive factors like overtime and paternity leave into account.
thedarkbatty	Reminder that Obama killed an American girl with a drone strike.
Grant Owens	Please vote, but not because a neoliberal told you to. Bring on progressives America. ✊
Mswordx23	Trump rules!!
desimurgi	Dear Mr. Obama. You had your turn. Now get your fingers out of DNC's affairs and fuck off. Thank you very much.
Ordaichte Poileas	Gotta vote or the communists will take over.
