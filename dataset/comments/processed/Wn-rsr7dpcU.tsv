Braxton Oertwig	My name is Braxton Oertwig of Las Vegas Nevada I just wanted to say that I have been a life long fan of the OAKLAND RAIDERS kept on following the raider when AL Davis decided to move the team to LA because he wa not going to be told by the NFL at the time that he could not move his team out of OAKLAND I to this day i felt he had made a mistake when he moved to LA but I forgave him when he moved back in 1995 to OAKLAND I believe the truth about the history of the Raiders and RAIDER NATION lie in the city of OAKLAND is it not true that the most note worthy game for the Raiders claim to NFL fame wa the HOLY ROLLER GAME THE GHOST IN THE POST GAME THE IMMACULATE RECPTION GAME THE FAMOUS HIDY GAME VS THE JETS ALL CAME AS THE OAKLAND RAIDERS NOT THE LA RAIDERS BUT THE OAKLAND RAIDERS As OAKLAND RAIDER NATION FANS we were proud and still are Proud of this heritage the player from these OAKLAND RAIDER SQUADS gave u TO BE THE MOST PROUDEST WIN LOSE TIE UNTIL WE DIE OAKLAND RAIDER FANS OUT THERE because the player from the OAKLAND RAIDERS squad were tough SOB S that never took crap from the opposition they will always have my respect forever Now with all of that being said I can not believe there is a chance the raider might be moving back to LA and if that doe come true I WILL RETIRE MYSELF FROM THE RAIDER NATION AS A OAKLAND RAIDER FAN THAT IS WHERE MY HEART LIES WITH THE OAKLAND RAIDERS AND THE OAKLAND RAIDER NATION I believe the Raiders fan that are in LOS ANGELES SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BEGINING OF WHERE THE RAIDERS CAME FROM AND HELP THE CITY OF OAKLAND COME TO A DEAL TO GET COLISEUM CITY ON TRACK BECAUSE OAKLAND IS WHERE THE RAIDERS BELONG TO THOSE IN LOS ANGELES THAT CLAIM TO BE RAIDER FANS AND WANT TO STEAL THEM BACK YOU LACK SLIVER AND BLACK AND YOU SHOULD BECOME RAMS FANS BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU DONT KNOW THE RAIDERS HISTORY AT ALL MR DAVIS UNDERSTAND THIS SOME THINGS ARE WORTH MORE AND GO BEYOND MONEY AND THAT IS THE RAIDERS HISTORY WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND PLEASE TRY TO STAY IN OAKLAND SIR I BELIEVE YOU CAN ITS POSSIBLE
