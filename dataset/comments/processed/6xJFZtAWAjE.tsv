IMJW1000	Jehovah know how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial —2 Pet 2 9 Suppose you are looking for a job If you live in a land where work is scarce you might be tempted to accept the first job offer—any offer—that come along What though if the nature of the work conflict with Bible principle What if the schedule or traveling involved will impede your Christian activity or take you away from your family Should you accept the offer anyway thinking that an unsuitable job is better than no job Remember choosing the wrong path could distance you from Jehovah Heb 2 1 Keep in mind your destination Ask yourself ‘ Where do I want a job or career to take me ’ If you view secular work a a mean to an end—to support yourself and your family in Jehovah ’ s service—Jehovah will bless your effort Matt 6 33 Jehovah is not stumped when you face a job loss or an unexpected economic downturn —Isa 59 1

Noise59	sound harsh but it true he is right
Jacob Linker	You messed up by asking for donation For some one teaching others to be multimillionaires why ask for money That put negative thought to others that are really looking for help If you re saying you can help people become multimillionaires the you shouldn t have to ask for donation That s taking money for those who don t really have money to give donation For those who do have the money to give out donation don t need your advice That s discouraging that you would ask that These video see more a a con that a help Good luck bud I hope you enjoy receiving money from people who really could use that extra money This really make me feel sick and make you look like a lowlife Congratulations I hope you feel good about yourself by conning other people I just hope others are just a smart a I am I m not dumb I m just looking for some guidance and sure a he ll didn t find it here with someone asking for money We might a well sit around corner street begging for money That s pretty much all you ve taught
l8on99	This guy is a purely negative jerk His message tip are right but very old school and terribly opinionated when he say wonderful it is even negative Not a motivational speaker at all skip to the next video if you came for inspiration Hahaha don t forget to donate I loved that dumbass ploy to him so he can call more people slug and hit on them I don t care if he is a millionaire he is an asshole loser that can not teach
