Daffy	To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Louis Cole The vibe is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical rhythm most of the flow will go over a typical listener head There s also Louis nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his lyric his personal philosophy draw heavily from Nas discography for instance The fan understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of his flow to realize that they re not just bar they say something deep about LIFE As a consequence people who dislike Louis Cole truly ARE idiot of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the beauty in J s existential catchphrase I own an entire fucking blimp which itself is a cryptic reference to Nas epic Illmatic I m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpleton scratching their head in confusion a Louis Cole s genius unfolds itself on their stereo speaker What fool how I pity them üòÇ And yes by the way I DO have a Louis Cole tattoo And no you can not see it It s for the lady eye only And even they have to demonstrate that they re within 5 IQ point of my own preferably lower beforehand
