Axxidous	You know Robin Williams is to thank for the iconic portrayal of Genie But he is not the only one to voice Genie He voiced him only in the first movie The other movie and the TV show had Genie voiced by a similar sounding voice actor Dan Castellaneta The guy who voice Homer Simpson This wa due to issue between Robin Williams and Disney I think Issues like him not wanting the promotion for Aladdin to overly feature Genie just because he wa voicing the character Then Disney let out a poster where Genie took up like 80 of the image XD Robin Williams said SEEYA lol MEANWHILE anyone here at least hoping Gilbert Gottfried voice Iago The parrot

chichi lala	Avan Jogia look much more of an aladdin rather then the actor they cast i know the actor they cast is arab born but a an arab i think Avan look ethnically closer to what aladdin should look like then the one they cast it kind of look disappointing because everything is computer made too since the desert is something arab land are very known for they could ve shot scene there it look more realistic that way and it ha very beautiful desert like the Sahara in Algeria and Morocco or in the gulf desert it would ve been much more beautiful and they wouldn t need much of a setting since it s already there in the era and style of the famous Arabian night folktale
Shakti Rai	Earlier this year I heard on the radio that Disney is on the plan to remake Aladdin But even though I saw the cartoon version when I wa a kid I decided NO I never want this in theater next year because I dislike the cartoon version of Aladdin and this live action remake coming next year I find some funny thing about the live action Aladdin teaser One is because it look slighty like new Bollywood movie with the desert landscape and the city at night or day Also the cave of wonder is part of a mountain instead of a dune and close it mouth when someone enters At the end of the teaser I m watching right now oh JESUS it wa Aladdin discovering the magic lamp which contains the genie I don t know who that person is playing Aladdin and I know Will Smith will be in this movie playing the genie plus I saw a movie starring Will Smith this year Hey you know what the end of the trailer would have said In Loving Memory Of Robin Williams since he played the genie in the cartoon because it wa just a though but I m not into him anymore after his death Well I m still not seeing this in theater but Congratulations to Will Smith Alright anyone who see this comment and know me please respect my opinion

Wistbacka	Aladdin is supposed to be extremely handsome No offense to the actor but this guy look nothing like Aladdin That said he might do an excellent acting job and portray Aladdin very good But so far we ve only seen his face Also why the heck is WIll Smith s name the only name shown He is not in the lead is he What is even his role EDIT Smith is the Genie That is some big shoe he ha to fill I freaking love Will Smith He is awesome But he can only do one role Will Smith and slight variant of Will Smith Unless it s drama then he can be other people a well But for action tough guy Comedic guy he can only be Will smith So I have really low expectation for him a the iconic genie

Caitlin McGuire	I see they didn t learn a thing from Beauty the Beast about terrible CGI I m not mad they cast Will Smith a the Genie but I m curious how he ll be played Smith certainly doesn t have the manic energy of Robin Williams but there s no reason he can t take the Genie in a different direction and have it work except that this is a Disney live action remake so there s also the good chance all Smith s talent will be wasted on either how do you do fellow kid type line or clash horribly with the animation or be the only good thing in a wasteland of a movie or Please don t animate the Genie like the Shark Tale Will Smith fish that s all I ask at this point

Ziggy Stardust	I hope they don t add black people in this film to please the black whining about life
Tsholofelo Makete	Nope
i_sniff_blue	When the then revolutionary CG animated cave opening in the 1992 kid movie is far more impressive then the same cave in the 2019 gritty live action reboot Seriously though we re all STILL rewatching and quoting entire scene from the original to this day because it wa THAT GOOD Don t blemish your best accomplishment with adaptation Disney Try something new Or take a shot at some not that great oldie at least

Emperor Xander	Idk if will smith wa good pick
J.G Productions	Considering Will Smith isn t really known for his impersonation or improv I think he ll have his own unique take on the Genie I think if they wanted to try to replicate the same improv style Robin Williams wa phenomenal at they would have gone for Gabriel Iglesias since he can do a variety of impression So I m willing to give Will Smith a chance
FoxyWhite	All of the live action remake have been disappointment so far but I can t help but want to see it just from loving the original Fuck you Disney and knowing you can make bank on nostalgia

dipita vanessa	I honestly don ’ t get why people choose to be so negative and complain about just everything I ’ m always excited to see a part of my childhood being brought to life Sometimes the plot twist and change take me by good surprise I mean it not every time one enjoys watching what he she already know As far a genie is concerned I think Will Smith will be great There ’ s no need throwing how Robbin Williams will be good can never be replaced bla bla bla Man he ’ s dead and that ’ s sad But here is a REMAKE and so different actor can take the role Besides the so called original Disney movie we cling to are equally remake from story before Its simple if you don ’ t like the movie don ’ t watch🤷🏽‍♀️ Stick to the one you prefer As for me I JUST CAN ’ T WAIT for this movie😊

Alexy	im gon na be honest and i reckon many people will agree i am not necessarily looking forward to this but goddam i am curious to see how will smith will portray genie he s great and all and i get the casting choice prince of bel air and all that jazz but hmm i have a bad feeling about this lol

Faisal Umair	Its prank There are only 12 month Not 24
Croaklikeatoad	In all fairness there are some new character who could be really interesting Though I do have little confidence they ’ ll get a chance to be developed I am worried that the tiger may have been replaced by a “ best friend and confidante ”
Colonel Cosby	Just dont expect this to be better than the original animated movie and dont hold Will Smith to the same amazing standard of Robin Williams Genie and I guarantee you will like and enjoy the movie but if you are gon na just compare the two movie and Will and Robin then of course it gon na suck and your just gon na come out of theatre hating saying it suck lol
nikqualuv09	😱😱 faint
Grace Stafford	I don ’ t like the live action but y ’ all need to stop saying it ’ s just for money Of course money ’ s in mind it always is But a lot of people have been waiting for this and don ’ t act all disgusted because someone isn ’ t finding something to whine about in a 90 second teaser

Rec Manyeah	Yo this look epic hope it will be
Victoria Davenport	Aladdin is played by Mena Massoud He wa born in Egypt but raised in Canada He s a cutie too If Disney had white washed Aladdin I would not be supporting it Im glad to see Disney casting ppl who truly fit the culture Now jasmine is being played by some English actress who s mother emigrated from Uganda Gujarati Indian so I guess she get a pas

Crash Schwarzenegger	I am honestly not really a big fan of these live action remake It s not the fact that it s disrespect the original but more of what s the point of even remaking them Cinderella i could kinda see why over the year the animated disney movie ha gotten more criticism over the year but aladdin The animated Aladdin movie is still a masterpiece witch hold extremely well up so why make a live action version Well probably because of money but still I am not gon na say that the movie is going to suck because that would just be dumb to say but I would have to wait to see if it s worth watching I just want to point out that I don t think these live action movie are bad but just underwhelming to me I know a lot of people love the live action version more then the animated version and that s totally fine nothing wrong with that I just like how they remake something that really dosen t need a remake in the first place This one could be diffrent it could be amazing or even better than the original we just have to wait and see

swanclipper	when your movie host the supporting actor a the main source of attention it kinda show how shit your ability to make a movie is 3 thing aladdin need great actor not quota filling true to the original story robin i genuinely hope these ethnically correct actor are good actor this wa your mistake for the jungle book SCARLET JOHANSON AS KAA but it s a super small role with a minute or two of screen time so stay quiet yet idris elba got little to no marketing and he is clearly the superior actor stop remaking your childhood and make a new one for the next generation you obsessive nostalgia driven retard give me something new to eat and stop letting will smith command screen time i saw suicide squad and it wa lame he get to pull his face and stare at people and he get paid for it the only time will smith is acting now is when he pretend jaden isn t a complete fucking tool i admit the movie look nice i like the cave already the open mouth is quite surreal don t change the song don t edit for the emotional cunt who complain about sensetivity issue or racism make a new exciting engaging movie instead of forcing the adult who grew up with these amazing movie to watch it with their kid and be upset it wasn t a magical amazing or full of wonder i promise this film ha already gone tit up the only reason i watched jungle book is co christopher walken wa king louie and his speech pattern is hilariously scary baloo being voiced by bill murrey wa a no brainer but the movie took something away from the original story i can t put my finger on it but the original is somehow more intriguing and painstakingly made to be enjoyed for a short time

Jen Sablefur	Disney are effectively erasing their heritage the style that made them such a juggernaut and consigning cel animation a a style to the dustbin of history I felt this way when The Princess and the Frog wa announced to be the final final feature in the traditional style and now it seems like it s absolutely meticulous and extremely obvious what s happening here They ve made a statement by remaking the iconic and popular feature first After all you just know that these remake are going to be the one to be repeated on TV in the future instead of the animated feature of the same name The next generation of kid will grow up not even knowing the original cel animated version of these story And a a fan of animation a an art form and style this is just tragic

Elevated Emotions	Cant understand what the deep voice is saying
Kaylee minnich	Everyone s so ungrateful and negative like wth is wrong with you people
Blank	I feel like the only reason they keep making these live action remake is because they have run out of original idea It also seems to be the reason they keep pumping out sequel to every semi successful film they have the right to
Love Zlaxa	Disney better do a dedication to Robin Williams because he is the true one and only genie
Justin Reid	He who control the spice control the Agrabah CGI Reboot But seriously even though this look well produced Hollywood is really losing it charm with their risk aversion on major picture I swear I have to go to art house theater to see any good original film that haven t gone through a bazillion focus group and marketing team Plus I m not even going to get started on how Disney ha transformed from an animation and theme park company to a giant monopolistic squid monster across the entertainment industry Movies these day can cost north of 25 to go see when you factor in concession price and would I pay those premium price to see a well made but formulaic reboot Absolutely not My childhood isn t ruined in any way by a movie like this that s just silly to say but just like after chewing gum for a really long time these live action remake are bland and rigid Kids deserve better than bland status quo stuff and Disney should bring u movie like Hayao Miyazaki s work the Pixar catalogue and Fantasia

DrakonyaPrime	So tired of seeing dumb motherfucker saying Disney is destroying their childhood The original are still there so unless Disney decides to erase them wich is impossible nobody is destroying anything so shut the fuck up And if you can t control yourself from watching something you hate then you need to see a doctor a fast a possible

Florian Peek	I m going to reserve Judgement on this until the first review and more info come out I hope to god they please PLEAZE leave the story intact and not input any of their SJW B S which they have effectively used to kill the Star Wars I will never ever go to see a SW movie again But Aladdin is not a white guy so I guess they might not have a problem with the more traditional love angle this time But I m almost sure they will turn Jago or the genie into a transsexual haha If I hear even a whiff of SJW crap is in it I will not go see this If they say true to the original story humor and message I m hoping this could be great
corgisbutt	They better be staying true to the original animation story wise

Blaze__Skywalker	No original idea so let s remake and ruin every classic
Maksym Drovnichenko	If this is true then this would be like a birthday gift to me
aypierre	It s funny how people slander Disney now for remaking old medium like that isn t something they ve been doing since the company s creation Everything Disney s ever done in the last 50 year have been remaking already existing medium to fit their vision Granted remaking your own medium is silly but that doesn t mean that this isn t just typical Disney and have ALWAYS been typical Disney Very few if any of their big budget cartoon have been original story Some are blatant rip offs and some are a little bit covert but they re remake of already existing story and folklore either way just like this is a remake That said I can excuse the original animation because they are exactly that animation With animation you can create style and visuals that just won t work with CGI Which is why Beauty and the Beast had a terrible visual style and which is why this movie will have a terrible visual style Disney is gimping themselves artistically by remaking their old animation You can t successfully recreate an expressive and vibrant animated character like the Beast because when it s live action everything ha to be firmly rooted in looking realistic otherwise the actor look out of place since you obviously can t change the visual style of a person s face This is the same reason you can t successfully recreate an expressive and vibrant animated character like Abu like Iago like the carpet like Genie
Mel Gibzon	SJW destroyed the movie and music industry Now the gaming industry make more than the movie and music industry combined oh we could sit from 9 to 5 talking about how you need to hire more minority because well who is best at the job let s take a racist approach and not hire people on their skin color Fast forward GLAAD Awards game need to have homo in them and indie game that do it genuinely don t count

Robert Ofenloch	Disney missed a huge opportunity IMO to make these movie an adaptation of the Broadway show rather than a shot by shot remake of the cartoon Lion King is completely unnecessary based on everything that s been said about it and so is Aladdin and neither one is using any of the song written for Broadway At least Dumbo is going to have some new story element

Sagara027	For some reason I fear that the main focus of the movie will be some social message aligned with some ideology narrative instead of Aladin street rat Aladdin the courageous and self determined Princess Jasmine For some reason this selection of word in the description of the video where they describe Aladin with a negative and derogative adjective and Princess Jasmine with positive adjective make me think that in a lot of the film they will focus on Jasmine and not Aladin only to make a feminist social statement I just hope I m wrong I just hope to see a great fantasy movie to escape from my reality and where they do not try to enforce any type of social message or social opinion

TheGuitar Person	I know that Will Smith is a charming guy and they re probably banking on him doing a good enough Genie that s going to be a different take from Robin Williams iconic portrayal Here s the thing Genie doing all those impression while showing off Robin s voice acting chop also worked in the context of the character being an ancient and powerful shape shifting deity who s seen it all and done it all It wasn t just a comedian doing impression Williams pretty much disappeared into the role and we buy him a this powerful but playful cosmic entity who s been unleashed after a long time I like Will Smith just fine but it s going to take an insane amount of willpower to separate the actor from the role in this case Being separated from the role wa never really Will Smith s thing he just kind of play himself in every role he s been given apart from the odd dramatic role like in The Pursuit of Happyness where he still play Will Smith except he cry a lot In this we re all pretty much just going in knowing that Will Smith s going to Will Smith all over the place with his role a Big Blue Wish Granting Will Smith

Cybergenic	One thing would Jim Carrey make a better Genie I think Will Smith would make a good genie or Iago but wouldn t Jim Carrey have had a slight edge over Will Smith in the voice acting department for crazy genie I think Will will be good but doe he have the vocal skill to be overly insane and whacky like Robin Williams and Carrey To be honest both Will and Jim are the only 2 actor I can think of that could voice genie so it s a win either way

Snaake	I love how everyone complains about not even two minute of a two hour movie assume it ’ s going to be bad even though a lot of the past remake were fine if you aren ’ t a crazy Disney traditionalist and actually try to appreciate what they did and then rant even more about how they ’ re making a movie they already announced they were going to make a year ago
S. B. and m. g.	Why is Aladdin a man Why can t we have a female Aladdin And Genie should be non binary that identifies themselves a a lobster and the lamp should be changed to a glass bottle because kid might actually get burned with real lamp thinking that there is a non binary genie that identifies themselves a a lobster inside it Jafar the Grand Vizier of Agrabah should be portrayed by an Australian aborigine because we never see Australian aborigine in any movie apart from Crocodile Dundee Also Cathy Areu AKA Liberal Sherpa should be casted a Princess Jasmine They look just the part Please fix your movie

Rooby Roo	I hope they will go more the Cinderella route and add to the story rather than trying to remake the same exact movie but worse like they did with Beauty and the Beast Of course the main difference there is that Cinderella s story had a lot that could be added to it where Beauty and the Beast wa already very fleshed out and didn t need a more in depth adaptation Aladdin doesn t need a remake but if they don t include that annoying bird from the animated movie maybe this will actually end up being better
Kelsey Robinson	The original will always be the original from Gilbert Gottfried s screeching Iago to the sweeping hand drawn landscape to Robin Williams s iconic turn a Genie Nothing can replace that especially for people who grew up with it But I m still here for this new film The sheer power and nostalgia behind the amazing revamp of Friend Like Me at 1 00 is enough to get me excited This isn t meant to top the 1992 animated classic I know that Disney is just cashing in on our feeling but I still want to see what THIS version of Aladdin will look like

Danni Jensen	Carving the Cave of wonder into the side of a sand dune is not a wondrous a the unstable tiger head rising from the sand in the animated original And why is the cave of wonder a lion head Does Jasmine own a lion in this one Yes I am suggesting that the tiger head and Rajah are linked by being the obstacle for Jafar to get either the lamp or the Sultans daughter And where are the imposing bright spotlight eye it used to have Cave of wonder plz cave of reasonably realistic wonder just doesn t have the same ring to it

Taybib	The orientalist stereotypical and dehumanizing depiction of Arab people and the Arab world from the original cartoon will undoubtedly carry over here a already shown here with the sand dune Disney made Coco last year a stellar film that accurately represented and celebrated Mexican culture and society which received overwhelming praise from Mexican viewer and public figure Why can t they make a movie that honor genuine Arab culture and society rather than distorting and making a mockery of it

Sebbb	I like the trailer music being remastered a an orchestral version of Arabian Nights and Friend Like Me But that s about the only thing I like about this whole project A good movie doesn t NEED a remake And there is absolutely no way that Robin Williams s Genie will ever be topped In Disney s defense though the original fairy tale is in the public domain so it s not like anything s stopping u from making our own non Disney inspired take on it

kindness ARK	I hope Will Smith will make a good Genie for the remake To be fair yes Robin Williams wa the best but I also think Will Smith could be just a good in his own equal way just so long a his Genie character is still funny I d love to see Will Smith be over sarcastic a lot a a Genie making silly funny pun every 2 second He doe have a good comedy side to him from past film But he s not done many kid film so it will be interesting how funny will he accually be in this new kid movie

Matan Gaash	‘ Aladdin ’ Writer Unhappy That He Was Excluded From And Not Paid For Disney ’ s Live Action Remake http www cartoonbrew com disney aladdin writer unhappy that he wa excluded and unpaid for disney live action remake 165286 html
Kalevipoeg	Yeah sorry no it s not even the Robin Williams thing entirely though of course you never had a prayer of replacing him Here s why I won t pay to see this The formula used shot for shot copying the original film s teaser using the music from the animated film showing incredibly bland looking actor who look NOTHING like the animated counterpart is EERILY similar to what we saw with the live action Beauty and the Beast And what we got with that film wa just bad I m sorry it wa bad Emma Watson can not sing She doesn t look like Belle at all nor would I ever buy her a the most beautiful girl in the town let s be honest She s cute But she s also a bit odd looking and mannish in some way The CGI just made the enchanted denizen of the castle look creepy and a lot of it fell flat because it wa directly comparing itself to a film that wa infinitely superior and MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL never needed to be remade in live action or at all Aladdin hold up to viewing even today It s a good movie It s a classic It s fun It ha Robin Williams for cry out loud It is the childhood many of u remember If you want kid today to be introduced to the story of Aladdin then just re release Aladdin and advertise the hell out of it Just release the animated film in theater TRUST ME kid will still love it But this Why Why make it at ALL There IS no point That s the issue here You didn t set out to try a new take on Aladdin s story that doe it own thing and doe not attempt to pointlessly mime the 1992 film No no no What you did here is shamelessly take what wa already done by your own studio cannibalize it and regurgitate it at the audience in hope of making some cash This is very obviously not done for artistic purpose It is done a a cash grab and I am calling Disney on it right now Shame on you Disney Is nothing not even your own classic sacred Look If I write a book and it s received really well and it becomes a classic should I in 25 year re write it only this time slightly changing some thing and adding photo of real people and try to pas that off a a new thing Shouldn t I be called on it for doing that Exactly Stop Disney Trust me on this Just stop the live action remake of film that didn t NEED to be remade or retold because they were so perfect the first time around Plus 2D animation actually allows for you to get away with visuals that just look stupid or weird in live action 2D animation isn t a BAD thing It s not an antiquated thing to be covered up with live action remake Be PROUD of the past Be PROUD of the beauty of those 2D animated feature They re wonderful If ANYTHING Disney should be fighting hard to keep traditional animation alive and well It s not a if kid today who have no conception of chronology of technology will see something that look like Aladdin 1992 and say no thanks I ll take Will Smith genie instead because it s newer It s not a if the bright color and bombastic nature of the animation doesn t still appeal to young mind ADULTS are the one trying to blame traditional animation for the declining box office gross we saw toward the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000 s But it wa NEVER the animation style that wa the issue It wa that film like Pocahontas Treasure Planet et al simply did not appeal to child because they forgot how to have FUN The film became lame The writing became bad or overly heavy handed Things became too political and too much thought wa given to how PC something wa race this color that gender this blah blah blah See kid don t care about thing like that They do not care I wa a kid in 1992 I saw Aladdin in theater I remember the feeling It wa fantastic and I loved it If my 9 year old self could see the original and then see the trailer for this I d call it a copy and I would not be interested because it come off a flat and uninspired even if at that age I wouldn t be able to translate that feeling into a coherent sentence Disney You need to respect the beauty of traditional hand drawn animation It ha a place even now and it always will IF you write it for kid and drop the socio political agenda plaguing film these day did you really need to insert a gay character into Beauty and the Beast No no you didn t Equality is all well and good but make a NEW film with a gay character if you simply must have one and stop going back and bastardizing your own work or should I say the work of the last generation of filmmaker who were in every way your superior just to appease some segment of the population that always whine if every single group that ever existed isn t represented in every single film ever made Tell you what I ll make you a deal If you go back to the drawing board after this film and your inevitable Mulan remake which by the way damned well better not have a bunch of white and black people in there for diversity this wa ancient China don t pretend it is anything else and you ASK yourself Why did The LIttle Mermaid work so well for so long Why did The Lion King Why did Beauty and the Beast animated Why did Aladdin animated Why are THOSE film still so beloved by so many after all these year ASK yourselves that I implore you and try to condense the answer to a list of commonality between these beloved classic And then if you can fathom why it is that those film are still so loved and were then a well and you take that understanding and set out to make a timeless classic animated not CGI lazy ass film that doe NOT have the usual modern aggressively PC agenda set out to truly make an animated film with EXACTLY the energy and mindset and thought process used in those earlier film and approach it like it still IS 1991 IF YOU CAN DO THAT I will not only go to see your movie in theater but I will actively promote it for free across every corner of the web I can reach And so will many others There s something missing in Disney film and it is that heart and spirit that carried across in the late 80 s early 90 Recapture it Don t try to recreate it in live action That won t work But you will maybe finally start to realize that when this too is met with a lot of displeasure from audience look at the comment here plenty of people are asking why you even felt the need to do this and are saying you can never replace Robin Williams so you already have a problem right out of the gate I say all of this Disney because I believe that you still CAN make great original film If you just stop making live action remake of everything that did well in the past It s kind of pathetic to be honest
JUST ADMIT YOU'RE SHIT	Looks like shit Pass

Christian Schmude	So I just read a little bit of Juicy news regarding this project Terry Rossio is a film writer and one of the co writer of the animated Aladdin and wa turned down by Disney when he offered monetary compensation for the use of scripted dialogue that he himself authored and is being repurposed for this production Because when the first movie wa being made nobody anticipated Disney would one day undergo this project of live action remake a such nothing within the writer contract wa included to guarantee credit for such an occurrence In other word despite being based off of another person script Disney is under no legal obligation to pay Terry Rossio or any other writer of the Disney animated feature that they are now rewriting Now that could have done it anyway out of sheer Goodwill but apparently that s not in the card So not only is Disney making the incredibly risky decision to release Aladdin without Robin Williams and expect for lightning to strike twice to make the fastest gain they can but they are also not giving credit to the people who actually made these movie that they are now starting over despite using a lot of the original scripted word This is not okay

Marie Antonette Ferrer	Robin Williams wa a good choice for voice casting in the cartoon world but I think Will Smith can justify the genie role in the semi real CGI world Though I would have preferred Kevin Heart but let ’ s all have an open mind
Rajshree Damare	Omg I am waiting for the next summer 😘😘
Vishal Kk	wow

Ajeetpura Prank	http youtu be jc877fzGVqc
brainman67	Did you know alladin wa about a boy named al a din who used to steal except you didnt have a monkey or a genie the princess he loved wa shaala and the thing that is so cool is that they ran off together without a word however the guard caught up to them they too al a din and were about to execute him for ransom however he wa saved by a local merchant who made up a story about how he forced him to kid nap the princess the king wa about to kill them both yet his daughter spoke up and everyone listened she wa cry but telling them that al a din wa going to forgo the plan and give her to the next town over the king believed his daughter but he would banish him to the dessert al a din obliged living a life a a thieve he ended up joining a guild that paid well jowever his heart yearned for his love so he sent a message to a boy who sent that message back to the palace both lover were to meet under a palm tree they did this for month until jafaar jhad caught them jafaar wa actually like a seceret spy who wa promised the daughter in marriage so al a din had a sword fight with jafaar losing he wa about to be kill yet al a din spared him and kissed him good bye the lover ran even farther past the border where he stole a ship and got a crew they had alots of baby and became rich

Gousiya Ansari	Amazing trailer 💝💝
Paul von Hindenburg	The mix of cgi and 3d animation and real life actor look awesome Just hope they don t try to make it serious and realistic and keep the fun laidback style of the old movie

Ollys Dead_channel	New meme confirmed Tsamina mina eh eh Waka waka eh eh Tsamina mina Egyptia This time for India

BizzarreProductions	This make no sense Part of the original movie ’ s whole appeal wa that it wa over the top cartoony That ’ s not likely to be replicated in a live action film unless the Genie is still 2D a la Who Framed Roger Rabbit
Nicholas Ackerman	did they use the same audio file for the cave

Carolina Alarcón	0 48 a Lion WHY
troye sivan trash	it doesn t seem right not having robin Williams a the genie im not sure how I feel about this remake tbh
grahamt19781	90 s Aladdin is the best Disney film ever imo
Bharath Kinnal	Let me guess This may be a different retelling of a nice movie where the story is completely fucked up to make it seem like it s another end of the world film that would affect all the character in the same way kind of what they did in Jungle Book Might a well see the care free original one at home instead of wasting my money to see this abomination in theatre Come on Disney Be original
Andres Cardenas	Okay this look badass
Ethan Trenaman	What
Sazleen Nadaf	Who love Disney 😀
A K	Why did they brush aladdin hair like that he should ve had messy hair and appearance I can t believe they cast a good looking actor but made him look terrible
Sandra Brody	Hopefully it better than Cinderella and beauty and the beast I don t get it it disney they have princess at Disneyland With dress that look straight out of movie but these life action one they couldnt do the same I wa and am SO disappointed
Dr. Bowser MD.	Is any one else disappointed about the lion cave thing or is it just me
Misting Wolf	I m glad that Disney is trying to expand their cast I just wish that if they re gon na follow their version of this story that they could find an actor closer to the age that Aladdin should be I suppose Mena Massoud will do well but it s painfully obvious he s not a teenager not in a bad way just you can tell
Kiara Love Carter	I ’ m still trying to picture Naomi Scott a Princess Jasmine I just can not do it
pastabowltomato1	Ezra Bridger should be Aladdin

Sen	Disney please for the love of God I am begging you Stop Just Stop You have so much money and so much power and so much talent and yet you use it to do this Live action always fails because it ha to measure up to the animation and it can t goodbye disney you are not what you once were banking on nostalgia and exploiting it doe not make good film it s pathetic business strategy too

Luís Direito	What s with all the whining about Disney remaking these movie They own the right to do so They are remaking their own movie their own version Perhaps they re doing it because they know their story are good and that with the current technology they can do something even better even greater something that probably they dreamt of doing in the past but didn t have the technology for They re only making it for the money Of course they are They are a company making a product to sell it to a consumer Big Surprise So what They do what they want They don t have a contract with you that establishes they can only produce exclusively totally original movie every year Companies reinvent themselves That s what they do when they re in the market for long They always get back to their root To their classic They don t forget the product that launched them and made them succeed Disney chose this path of retelling or rebooting or remaking or whatever their story and that s totally fine and legitimate Nobody ha the obligation to watch the movie Just pas it Go watch something else

Angelica Tapia	I think the idea of live action for the disney movie is awesome and im super into it but they didnt do very well on cinderella or beauty and the beast so it kinda dissapointing I hope they make more that are actually successful
Special Agent Oso	I WELCOME this remake on the ONE CONDITION that you include the following In the song Never Had A Friend Like Me there were 3 belly dancer wearing red skirt One of them almost kiss Aladdin MAKE SURE YOU PUT THESE GIRLS IN THE SONG IN THIS MOVIE No excuse Hire some lovely middle eastern or Indian girl luscious tan skin bindis curve red veil long pony tail with gold hair cuff Thumbs up everyone if you want this to happen It s pure orientalism fantasy at it best

TheTheBest	Get this ALADIN IS A MOTH
Mason Lee	I thoroughly enjoyed Aladin and initially thought of having my son see this a he enjoyed it a well But knowing how feminist disney is right now I think I ll watch it first without spending a single dime to feminist disney of course and if it s clear of any toxic feminism then I ll have my son watch it

j parks	moslem will blow up Disneyland because of this They did it last time
Paelorian	I can already hear the caterwauling of progressive since there s no way to do a traditional fable of the middle east properly without upholding some exotic orientalist convention otherwise it would be pretty much unrecognizable However showing that the only actor is the swarthiest Arab they could find might win over the SJWs if the casting is racially biased enough to enjoy the same effect a Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians The social discourse usually ignores what is by far the most important subject whether the movie succeeds in being a story well told or not This teaser is too little evidence to have a good idea of the quality of the film
Joelle18 MSP	This movie is based on Middle East I hope they don ’ t change the culture of it into Indian or Pakistan no hate

Eno P	I can tell this movie is going to suck like their other remake Disney ha run out of creative juice and they ’ re desperately rummaging through the Disney vault for idea That ’ s why they keep making crappy remake not because they ’ re actually interested in doing something good but just because they want to make some money without putting much thought in it That ’ s why the live remake are very cheap looking the casting is terrible etc The scene from this teaser trailer are not impressive Again it look tacky and that Aladdin look like some hipster or something Um no thanks
Samus Aran • Lone Avenger of the Abyss	You realize that if any kid is going to be shown Aladdin this is going to be completely ignored in place of the original film for these story The only reason I truly believe you are trying to pull a Japan spamming anime skit is because you ran out of idea Walt would be pissed if he saw this shit Also you re fucking up if this is based off of a specific part of the world If you re going to tell an Arabian story these actor all need to be Arabian Can t do that Stop trying You created confused Marvel fan Then you messed up Star Wars in 3 year when it took over 40 year for someone to jump in a fake band wagon and say nothing make sense when it all doe You messed up the Star Wars timeline too You literally can not even follow it now And now you want to harm your own classic Get off of my recommended

Sanjana Satish	so excited for the movie I just hope it doesn t become garbage in all honesty Agrabah is related to the old kingdom of Agra which is located in India The palace that you see is the Taj Mahal which is also Indian The whole story take place in India during the time India wa composed of Pakistan Afghanistan and India During this time period a majority of India excluding the south had been taken over by an Arabic sultan that is the kingdom of Agra in India and others so to summarize the kingdom is technically Arabic but in the country of India If you disagree please don t hate on me and rip me off instead be kind and educate like how I m spreading the knowledge I know

Last name: Ellis	I love the excitement the trailer give off But tbh based on my research to seeing the cast and their role and character they ’ ll be playing a I wa quite disappointed None of these people look nothing like the character in Aladdin Not saying they ’ ll look exactly like them but I feel there should had at least had some sort of similarity But hey Hopefully they do the makeup right But All I got to say is Aladdin ha been one of my favorite childhood Disney movie DON ’ T FUCK IT UP cause you already threw me off with the actor And don ’ t think cause you threw will Smith in the movie that you ’ ll save it But I ’ m still hoping it ’ ll be good 🙄

Mitrik Gaduk	Will Smith is playing Genie Anyone remember Kazaam I mean brittish looking guy find lamp out pop a dead faced Will Smith in chain Guys I m just saying we re getting a little too close to a Kazaam prequel here It doesn t help the fact that they attempted to tan the actor to make them fit in better a been reported to which they tried to cover up pun intended and now we have to question whether an aging Will Smith can pull off comedy with a big grin on his face an outlandish personality and all around humble and optimistic character I mean he hasn t played a character like that for fucking age nor do I think he s capable of it now

Aya Khoury	So it ’ s ok for Indian actor to play or be suggested for Middle Eastern role but when it ’ s any other race or ethnicity there is an uproar if they cast someone who is not a part of that race or ethnicity The hypocrisy for this movie is undeniable Disney mess up when they cast Naomi Scott a Jasmine it should have gone to a Middle Eastern actress Yes you can still argue over the fact that there are Indian influence in the Disney movie but that ’ s probably Disney being ignorant and not doing their full research on Arab culture And it should not matter if the tiger ’ s name is Indian or the castle look like the Taj Mahal because at the end of the day Jasmine is still Arab

Hans Hubner	Why is a black American playing a middle Eastern genie Racist
Darkrunn	So overall it doesn t look terrible but there are some definite problem with the trailer 1 It suffers from modern trailer syndrome where instead of building our anticipation for the movie it s just screaming out recognizable music a loud a possible to remind u we ve already seen this movie before 2 While I appreciate them not showing every cool shot in the movie in the trailer I feel like there must have been something better than Iago flying or Al picking up the lamp I know this isn t going to be the only trailer but it look like Disney is pressing f to print money pretty hard Still this impression could change with a better trailer or when the movie come out

A C	GD Disney seriously stop with these live action remake As a former cast member who sold plenty of your animated catalog of film until they went back in the “ vault ” until a poor direct to video wa made or an anniversary release why bother calling the animated original classic anymore or releasing them for a limited time It ’ s not like these are original story anyway your library of animation come from PD source you twisted enough to make them something you could copyright and sell ad nauseam The animated original are classic these are cash grab for kid parent that didn ’ t grow up with them And now Mary Poppins Returns Ruining SW wasn ’ t enough

CLOUDY NOODLES	arguement for everyone saying this movie is trash because of not casting a real Arabian to play the role I dont see the point in casting a person based on race only they guy they ve cast Here is a good and accomplished actor he look ok ish like aladdin ha a great vocal range and played a role in a pretty accomplished series and so on me myself dont really see the point in judging a movie by race of actor only and I quite dont understand why anyone should it Id acting afterall which mean playing a role not being it I think Disney really ha tried to give u some great actor theyre trying to make money on this afterall and if they want to do that they ve got ta cast some actor we like they also made genie black Or if you wan na use the term afro amarican isnt that a plus in the book for you guy Thats all I have got now I would really like to hear your argument down below a long a you dont go banana and begin calling name then please either calm down Or dont write thanks
Majid A	I wonder if they ll still sing Where they ll cut off your ear because they don t like your face in this movie And I bet not a single actual Arab will be acting in this movie They ll get Indians because western people think everyone beyond Ukraine look Indian You know since they re so ignorant and all

Hijabi Gamer	Kim kardashian should get the role of Jasmine no Aladdin should be Chinese no Aladdin should be white No he should be Indian Can y all like give the role to Middle Easterns That s what the audition poster asked for Middle Easterns age 18 25 Google it I think it s rather racist to want the role to be anything other than middle Eastern it also won t look right in the filming The Jungle book used a Indian kid for a Indian story and it turned out looking amazing because he ha the same background a the character and the same Looks that s all I ask for Aladdin and Jasmine being cast for Middle Eastern Arabians 💕

Keeta	i m trying to keep high hope but IDK about having will smith a Genie lIke i feel anyone else could of been better for the role Chris rock eddie murphy gabriel iglesias Something about will Smith just doesn t feel right like he feel le humorous and more serious in movie now Unless he can act a crazy a he used to when he first started in the 90 I just don t see it i know no one will ever fill Robin s shoe but I still feel like they could have casted an actor who still focus on being funny and le on being serious and action filled cuz that s how I see Smith anymore but hey maybe Smith will surprise u maybe this is him trying to jump back into funny role again and get out of the serious action hero style he s been in for a few year now

David Lyle	Wow I am looking forward to this live adaptation of one of my favorite Disney Classics The Aladdin original movie is so iconic to me because not only wa it released in theater in 1992 Just five month after my birth day but through out my child hood and even into my young adult life my mother along with a couple other close friend and family nicknamed me David the Diamond in the Rough Also I relate very close to Aladdin s character a I wa raised in the lower class been called many mean name growing up yet always wanted to know what it is like to live in the upper class American life Also I melt when I see a beautiful woman who I really wish wa single and that I might have the chance of asking her out and then having the potential of falling in love getting a ring on her finger and having a wonderful life together in our castle with some kid of our own Yeah the good life Well I not going to have any genie that s for sure so Ill need to work hard pray hard and strive every day to grow a an individual to become the greatest version of me that I can be

Silentgrace11	I suppose I learned with Jumanji that director can still do a movie well and do it right and so long a it isn t solely a cash grab they usually make the best effort to do so There s not a much creative allowance here to create a different Genie like they did by having an entirely new story for Jumanji but I m still leaving room to see if they still do the Genie justice without parodying Robin Williams s work a Genie Can t stop them from starting to recreate the film of my generation after all so I suppose the best option is to just sit back and try to enjoy the ride

gildarmesh	R I P Robin Williams Anything Aladdin without you is not worth time to go watch Aladdin 3 again and stay away from this far worse movie They are on this live action kick and forgot the abortion that wa the return of jafar Just realize live action for memorable cartoon anime and manga is near impossible Like a great man once said about the remake of majora s mask is that when creator don t understand what wa good about the original they can t do well with a remake you have to embrace what make it unique and double down Look at marvel movie respecting source and then just going for it while most other franchise like dc would try to remove the outlandish nature of their character marvel embrace them This will fail a much or more than the huntsman a different live action remake BY THE SAME COMPANY just learn your lesson Disney

Trevor	Looks great it will never surpass the original though Dear Disney Why have you lost your first love The 2d hand drawn style wa beautiful And with today s technology there is no reason why a hand drawn 2d style can t be done on a tablet I grew up watching your movie and those of Don Bluth a well They were inspiring enchanting and surreal And the quality of moving exaggerated form 2d paint given life wa stylistically appealing in it own way It brought a reality that that activated and energized the imagination and brought color and warmth through generalization that every little hair on a rendered CGI lion can not You inspired me to love art I thank you for that I just wish you would open your eye and see the Never land and Wonderlands that can only be found by your original style I m not against realistic movie I love CGI film but I feel like there s been something missing for a long time Sincerely Trevor

Mr Beats	There is obviously significant change in the technology that ’ s around to date Seeing a so many people are complaining about the decision to have Will Smith play part of Genie a part I don ’ t think can ever be replaced with anyone An idea would be to cut the original vocal part out of Genie Robin and do a new better animated Genie with the voice of Robin I really like Will Smith but it ’ s just such a magical moment of memory so perhaps a way to keep everyone happy is to use take from the original vocal and build them into a 2019 animated Genie for this reboot I ’ m sure there ’ s even some joke that Robin made that never seen the light of day A lovely touch for what wa only Robins Thoughts P S I will go to see this movie even if Will Smith is in it

FirstStarRaven	How can they redo Robin William ’ s genie Trick question they can ’ t
The Lonely Stormtrooper	Come on Disney The original came out in 1991 this is too early for a reboot There s a complete lack of originality on your part and you haven t made any original content in year Stop looking for money and give u something we a a fanbase love The nutcracker look great however and it s something that we haven t seen you do yet I feel like this is unnecessary and a plot to get more cash out of our wallet I agree that some movie are in dire need of a reboot such a Dumbo I think that Aladdin is still fresh to this day Bad move on your part Disney Also who here think that Will Smith can replace Robin Williams THE ROBIN WILLIAMS GOSH
Ricardo	I hate when producer give the first credit to a famous actor which is not the main one in this credit only appears WILL SMITH Aladdin I mean The movie is called Aladdin not Genie That happened with Cinderella too Cate Blanchet had the first credit And i love her Galadriel and her acting and obviously wa really good in cinderella but a i said the movie wasnt called The Stepmother Now Lily James is doing well We all respect the famous and great actor but the producer ha to respect the new one that ha the main role and all the weight on their shoulder

Paulo Maurício	Yeeeah not interested Aladdin wa a great a it wa because it wa animated The genie colour and general tone are all thanks to the animated environment Judging by the remake track record they are gon na try to make nearly bit by bit what the original wa in a live action scenario This is a big mistake It be a lot better to change the story around a bit to be more mature and work around that Copying something animated to L A is never a good idea
erubin100	So this is a straight up remake of the animated film that probably won t use anything from the original source material right

Koro Moro	I ’ m seriously getting sick of this You know I don ’ t mind live action movie and I suppose I can handle some remake but I feel like Disney need to occasionally stop and think what form of presenting an idea best give off the tone the story is trying to show I feel like more fantastic and magical based movie are good being left the way they are The Jungle Book live action movie although I never watched it so correct me if I ’ m wrong but it seemed to be going for such a darker theme than the animated version It mess with the tone Wouldn ’ t it be best to come up with an original idea because at this point all these movie are about a original a the animated The Lion King but that ’ s another tangent for another day

Tom Thedutchguy	meh the trailer feel like any other trailer for a life action disney reboot they know how to hype you up but in the end it will be nothing more than a bunch of actor wandering around in empty or overfull set with a shitload of CGI stuffed in their to make it feel more epic but really it kinda take away the magic personality and soul that the original animated classic brought to the table all those year ago sure kid and the easily amused casual movie go er will probably get a kick out of it but the hardcore disney fanatic and your socially retarded internet dweller will call betrayal and will be super duper offended for really real Some movie critic will probably give you a well thought out opinion about it and others will say whatever it take to get more butt in the theater seat I ll admit that this teaser kinda spark my curiosity but ofcourse when I go out and watch it the film itself I will compare it to the animated classic but I will also look if the film brings anything new to the table and or if they add in some stuff from the original 1001 night story The last thing I ll say is that i m willing to approach this movie with an open mind but that it will probably be hard for me to judge will smith s version of the genie fairly seeing how the late Robin William s version of the genie is for one so iconic and memorably and second the fact that robin william s genie is one of my favourite movie character of all time
shubham	http youtu be i8nCBYSi7q0
TransparentLabyrinth	I wa thinking nobody can replace Robin Williams but Will Smith can certainly hold his own a a lively whimsical personality He pretty much made his career on that archetype
iRinnda	Since I scrolled down some comment and didn t see it said already lem me be the party pooper No we don t want live action remake of the classic I m showing the original animation to my maybe future child anyway What we want is new story with nice animation Because if Disney ain t coming up with some soon what will I entertain the child with Fanfics Some anime I know next to nothing about Johnny Johnny Yes Papa

H. S.	I m really concerned about Will Smith s version of genie tbh no one can top Robin William s version and it will be difficult for me at least to accept a new version of Genie I think Eddie Murphy might have been a better pick because his vocal charisma and he ha more experience with voicing cartoon Just my opinion though I still look forward to more trailer of this to see if it s worth the expense of seeing in theater lol
Peaxhes	Man everyone ’ s hating on this movie but I ’ m super excited
Nassir Ahmad	It s hard to tell from just a teaser but I suspect this will be good I trust Disney to hold themselves to a high standard and I m rarely disappointed

Invisibly Visible	WHITE WASHED
Valerie Winter	The CGI are disappointing Aladdin if all the effect from the cartoon were properly transferred to the live movie would have the potential to be something like Lord Of The Rings This though look like a cheap tv movie where they have to do on a small budget Aladdin wa the only Disney movie I wanted to see on live but this is just pathetic I won t put my money to watch that

Blackstone Creation	It s dark like DC universe
R Lord	Although I don t have much hope of this being a good film Will Smith a the genie is a bos choice Will Smith may not be Robin Williams but I can see him having so much fun with the role I m just assuming that he s the genie I haven t looked at anything about it because I m not interested in the Disney remake but it s the only thing that make sense to me If it turn out he s Jafar then I m definitely not going to watch it because that s some serious miscasting right there Although to be fair this is probably one of the movie that could definitely be improved with a remake The original is definitely dated by this point So hopefully this time they ll cut the pop culture reference Disney of all company shouldn t be afraid to try new thing I m a firm believer that if you re going to remake a product then you should take it in a whole new direction I liked the Jungle Book remake because barring a few of the musical number which fan would riot over if they weren t included the movie wa very different from the original I don t know if I would place it in my favourite Disney movie but I respect them for at least trying to do something different Please Disney do not just refilm the original movie with live actor There would be no point in that And I refuse to pay to see Aladdin twice over I would be more likely to go see a re release of the original film I m not going to lie A part of me doe want to see Will Smith a the genie rap Fresh Prince of Bel Air but that s just the 90 kid in me and should be ignored But maybe a a blooper or after the credit roll That would be pretty cool

merpiersee	Okay everyone need to stop with the Genie complaining Stop comparing everything to Robin Williams No we don t need an impersonator to play Genie All Robin did wa set a high bar The greatest thing about Robin George Carlin Eddie Murphy is that there is only one of them They each have a gift that can never be copied Will Smith ha the energy to bring a cartoon to life and his vocal range isn t like Robin s but can do it justice Stop comparing to the old and enjoy it for what it is Will Smith already ha impossible shoe to fill I think he s brave for even trying knowing half of Williams fan want him nowhere near the role As long a he can bring to the table even a fraction of what Williams did I ll be happy I m going to enjoy each of them for what they are separately But every other comment saying they need to find a Robin impersonator or no one can be a good a Robin is ridiculous Will Smith will be AS GOOD a Robin Williams but in his own way

Hedgpig	0 47 Stop right here and go watch the Cave of Wonders scene from the original In the original the cave rise out of the sand in the middle of the desert a a result it dominates the scene Here they ve got it stuck in a chasm on the side of a wall It feel diminutive and it only take up a quarter of the picture Not a good sign when a minute and a half long teaser show someone missed something that obvious and important

Ryne S.	I use my last wish to wish for no more Disney remake If the Menken song remixes don t improve upon the already stunning original and if the vibrant dynamic 2D animation is reduced to dark fake o computerized 3D why are we doing this Oh right money Will Smith could be a fun Genie maybe But this movie will probably suffer from the same problem a the other recent Disney remake and not diverge enough from it animated source material The original story of Aladdin includes more than one genie well some version do anyway but I d be surprised if they dared to do something that interesting here Of course not everyone want the same stuff so if you have different hope or expectation for this movie that s fine

CGF Movies	Disney FUCK OFF We ’ ve been over this The one fucking company of all place you should be original The CGI in this look like absolute garbage and you ’ re REUSING FRANK WELKER ’ S PERFORMANCE FROM THE ORIGINAL ANIMATION Fuck off And the cave is god awful whoever ha worked on this movie is Guy Ritchie you ’ ve got to be fucking kidding me the guy who ’ s made the terrible King Arthur movie seriously How unoriginal and uncreative can you people get The cave should be moving alive and animated not a fucking still you ’ d put on one for your reused story Disney on Ice performance The fade in and fade out to make this movie look “ magical ” is fucking fake and is getting really old Stop remaking your classic and start making NEW ONES with original idea I ’ ve had it I ’ m fucking fed up with you and this god awful monopoly you ’ ve built Fox Marvel Star Wars you need to back the fuck off Beauty and the Bleh wa absolute trash and I hope to god it ’ s forgotten Dumbo look just a bad and look NOTHING like a Tim Burton movie and oh my Jesus The Nutcrakcer is even worse A perfect story with an amazing HARD WORKING creative ballet tradition that will be thrown away into piss poor garbage for a political agenda is disgraceful and yes there is a fucking political narrative to those film with Disney being fucking stupid in the SJW Hollywood and dspaite the fact Four Realls and B B17 are by the same director who is terrible at his job and is uninventive they both LOOK LIKE the same movie for god sake This is why Pixar and the Animation Studios ALONE will always have my full respect despite the fact that Wreck It Ralph 2 is pondering to SJW ’ s by making Tiana darker for whatever reason and havin a strong female feminist message showing through the trailer but nevertheless I can still look past that hopefully because I fucking enjoyed Wreck it Ralph They are always 100 more original than what you ’ ve become within the past 3 fucking year yeah no shit they do sequel they got ta make money but either way you have to admit that they put more work into their film than these live action adaptation that are being pumped out YEARLY by the number since it ’ s a trend to follow Marvel studio and the MCU ’ s style of filmmaking But holy Christ have I had it I ’ m sure people will start doing the same if they ’ d just wake up and open their eye But seriously though Disney stop it Do what you do best with animation and creating ORIGINAL story and content don ’ t even get me started on what you do with your park because you ’ re just fucking idiot when it come to that and disrespectful As someone who ’ s said it before best “ Disney your heart in the right place but your head up your as ” Jeremy Johns

llamas for no reason	When in the Course of human event it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political band which have connected them with another and to assume among the power of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature s God entitle them a decent respect to the opinion of mankind requires that they should declare the cause which impel them to the separation We hold these truth to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness –That to secure these right Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just power from the consent of the governed –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these end it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying it foundation on such principle and organizing it power in such form a to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient cause and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evil are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the form to which they are accustomed But when a long train of abuse and usurpation pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security –Such ha been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injury and usurpation all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world He ha refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good He ha forbidden his Governors to pas Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained and when so suspended he ha utterly neglected to attend to them He ha refused to pas other Laws for the accommodation of large district of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrant only He ha called together legislative body at place unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measure He ha dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasion on the right of the people He ha refused for a long time after such dissolution to cause others to be elected whereby the Legislative power incapable of Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the danger of invasion from without and convulsion within He ha endeavoured to prevent the population of these States for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners refusing to pas others to encourage their migration hither and raising the condition of new Appropriations of Lands He ha obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary power He ha made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their office and the amount and payment of their salary He ha erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarm of Officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance He ha kept among u in time of peace Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislature He ha affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power He ha combined with others to subject u to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our law giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation For Quartering large body of armed troop among u For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States For cutting off our Trade with all part of the world For imposing Taxes on u without our Consent For depriving u in many case of the benefit of Trial by Jury For transporting u beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offence For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and enlarging it Boundaries so a to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for u in all case whatsoever He ha abdicated Government here by declaring u out of his Protection and waging War against u He ha plundered our sea ravaged our Coasts burnt our town and destroyed the life of our people He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the work of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstance of Cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous age and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation He ha constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioner of their friend and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands He ha excited domestic insurrection amongst u and ha endeavoured to bring on the inhabitant of our frontier the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all age sex and condition In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble term Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people Nor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brother We have warned them from time to time of attempt by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over u We have reminded them of the circumstance of our emigration and settlement here We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the tie of our common kindred to disavow these usurpation which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our Separation and hold them a we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in War in Peace Friends We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intention do in the Name and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and declare That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that a Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor

RavenHunter X	I like the trailer sooooooo much I love it 😆😆😆 But there s those comment I read about those who r making fun that Aladdin should ve been a Chinese guy and it really got me mad because aladdin is an Arabian guy First of all it wa bad and not realistic to make Aladdin the hero a Chinese where he life in an Arabian place also HOW COME HE S CHINESE WHEN HIS FATHER IS AN ARABIAN GUY Also if he s supposed to be Chinese why in the world would he be named Aladdin That s an Arabian name What is he doing in an Arab country in the first place In my opinion Aladdin is Arabian because that s how logic it should be and if Disney did really make him a CHINESE person who life in an ARABIAN Country with the name ALADDIN having the SAME SKIN AS ARABS the same LOOKS and he s STILL CHINESE Then even though I like Disney soooooo much but if Disney did make Aladdin a Chinese in the original book then she ruined Aladdin so much they need to fix it Aladdin is an Arabian guy that s how logic and reality work people

Adam Hargett	This film should not be mishandled The charm and story telling should not be replaced by CG PERIOD Stop putting all the emphasis on what look good and let the story telling fall through like a sack of brick Aladdin had an entertaining set of character that did well to not overexert themselves to please the audience Yes Robin Williams had a wacky character but it wa only due to his incredible acting through a fictional character that is worked wonder Simple scene like when the sultan took a carpet ride on after Prince Alibaba wa all the film needed to win over the audience If your going too realistic you cant incite the humor like when the bird slammed into a pancake after running for his life from the sultan bashing into him with the carpet Simple effect like this wa all that wa needed Not unnecessary over the top graphic that take up too much screen time Your not trying to make another Avatar so don t try Aladdin s character wa crafty selfish and stubborn He spoke from the heart and expressed his frustration openly even if it hurt those around him Don t try too hard to make him the protagonist from the start he only became the hero after all his lie were laid bare and had no choice but to fight Jufar and show his real worth which lie far within

TuttiTunes	Regarding the whole Genie thing i think they ’ re probably going the same route they took with the Broadway musical in which case I ’ m more than willing to give it a shot The musical is brilliant Nothing can replace Robin Williams ’ s iconic performance nor is it meant to but maybe something new and exciting can come from this

MissMiserize	Oh thank God Aladdin s wearing a shirt lol I ll give the original a pas because it wa made in the ninety and it s a cartoon but the outfit didn t make sense for the culture it represents I really want to see what Jasmine wear a well ha other culturally accurate detail And before I get angry white Disney fan complaining that they love the old movie I do too but have you noticed that the white princess are much better dressed than the non white one Jasmine s outfit is definitely based on a fetisized idea of exotic woman and is pretty disrespectful I m also not slut shaming I m Indian and we used to show more skin in ancient time but Arabs were always more modest so it should reflect the culture instead of mixing up all brown people up and on top of that not getting any culture s cloth accurate
Deepika Shukla	Wow
Nyurzo	Even though I generally against movie adaptation of Disney animation I really want to see what Ritchie will make out of this
rochelle Crump-mcnulty	That wa it un wow Looking forward to the next trailer
MuffinTin36	I ’ m very excited for the movie BUT they got an half Indian half white actress to play jasmine The original Disney storyline version took place in Iraq There are sooooo many Arab actor who would have fitted that role and loved to represent this culture I ’ m kind of surprised Disney would do this especially since they successfully cast black ppl for their new Lion King and an Indian boy for the Jungle Book but non Arabs for a Arab story I hope other ppl complain At least Aladdin is Arab
Variasam2	This look just a terrible a every other live action remake you shill have put out Ever considered not saturating your own market and making something original for once Or are you only able to rehash the same shit over and over for the gaggle of moron you ve cultivated a an audience There is nothing of value here The ugly lazy dull CGI ified look the generic visual design and generic polished actor the painful and cringey epic slow orchestral riff on Friend Like Me Just stop It is fucking revolting
Ishakbibble	I can assure everybody reading this that Disney will not try to have Will Smith do a Robin Williams impression but instead breathe new life into the character and make it his own If you don t like the idea of Will Smith a Genie before you see anything simply because it s not Robin Williams then you re an extremely close minded individual and maybe you should go back and watch the cartoon Not everything ha to be for you
Timensi Stewart	This should have stayed animated
ALi irfan	dISNEY Quit remaking old story do some THINK new project Like Ali and Jin s school

NINJA/SNIPER PRODUCTIONS	I have a few question 1 Is Will Smith playing everyone in this film because he s the only actor credited in this trailer If he isn t then I feel like his credit is unneeded 2 Will the film keep Where they CUT off your ear if they don t like your face in Arabian Nights If not I don t know and lastly 3 Why is this film animated I thought this wa a Live Action film or are they afraid of going cheap I think I might answer my own question they are because the needle increase in animation is not needed at all Bugger it 4 Why credit Will Smith when he clearly isn t in this trailer Oh it s a tease and my hatred for it wa because of my clashing belief that them using animation for 90 of the film wa for me considered an animated film and that it seems like a cash grab West Philadelphia NO Not again

Dan Schwartz	I hate this It look like it s just going to over exaggerate everything Let s make the cave of wonder voice SO deep and gruff that it s barely comprehensible Oooh and let s make the pillar that the lamp sits on 1 06 SO high up and that it would be physically impossible to get on top of by any normal human mean Like four or five time higher than any of the pile of gold And even if Aladdin manages to climb up it let s completely disregard the fact that he and his clothes would get dirty This feel like a perfect metaphor for Disney s ego overblown and squeaky clean

supermariosonic 298	I m sorry but I m not looking foward to go and see a new live action remake of Aladdin The concept of a live action remake of Aladdin is a bad idea in my opinion I just find it unnecessary I don t think the new live action version can outmatch the original 1992 animated version I m sorry but it just can t No matter how hard Disney tried I really wished that Disney can only remake their worst and weaker film Why not remake 2D traditional hand drawn animated film of Chicken Little and The Wild Why not remake Home on the the Range into a 3D computer animated film And why not remake The Black Cauldron into a live action film Just to make plenty of room for improvement Like improving the story and character development Just make them worthy Disney classic ok But don t remake anymore perfect original animated film ever again after that Do you understand

Asylum117	Does Dinsey just HATE 2D animation This is basicly the Disney movie sequel all over again except rebooted live action movie classic Where the hell is the originality and imagination I love Disney a much a the next guy but this is just a cash grab now You can t just abandon something that wa once great and remake it for the sake of money That is just lazy and destroys everything that the original movie stood for What would Walt Disney say if he saw this with his own eye He would be really dissapointed You guy keep on saying For the memory of Robin Williams but even Robin Williams himself would be baffled and dissapointed from the current direction and situation Disney is taking their buisness practice I know money is important but is it that important that we shouldn t even try anymore to make something creative and imaginative The Lion King 2D animated movie inspired and made me love animation and now once a great movie that even won an Oscar is being freaking remade and have Byonce a a voice actress This is just madness If people keep on supporting and praising stuff like this then there is no hope for original and creative idea anymore We will just get nothing but reboots remake etc until there is NOTHING left And I mean NOTHING

audacious pert	I want Tim Burton to direct Courage the cowardly dog😔
BarnstormDubbinStuff	I m betting the twist will be that Will Smith won t be reviving his on pause comedic style of acting but will instead be really serious and arguably the villain of the movie I don t doubt he could nail a song like Friend like me but I don t expect him to be pulling any imitation out of a rabbit hat Robin wasn t just a great character actor He wa a damn good voice actor When ha Will Smith ever done more than the voice of Will Smith

Jose Benjamin Vargas Terrero	wrong voice for the lion cave
Mariane Rose Torrefiel	Is no one going to talk about why Al ha a shirt on in this movie
Starganderfish	Wow Will Smith a the Genie Thats nut Disney should just approach Robin Williams estate and respectfully request to re use the voice recording from Robin Williiams original performance Disney can CG Animate the new Genie around that They d have hour of out take and improv from Robin a well becase that s how he worked so you could do a lot of new line and scene There s no need to replace Robin Williams when you can re use him As for who could do it better than Will Smith My vote is almost anybody He ha almost no range Robin Williams could play everything from a terrifying stalker in One Hour Photo to a tragic comic radio host in Good Morning Vietnam to a mournfully inspiring teacher in Dead Poets society Will Smith pretty much play Will Smith Will Smith the MIlitary Pilot in Independence Day Will Smith the Lone Survivor in I Am Legend Will Smith the Cowboy in Wild Wild West Will Smith pretty much a Will Smith in a suit in Men in Black they didn t even really try at all with that one I might give him prop for Ali or Pursuit of Happyness but it s really rare for him to stretch himself Who could do it better How about Jim Carey Mike Meyers Sasha Baron Cohen Geez Mel Brooks did just voicework for Hotel Transylvania 3 this year and the guy 92 year old He d do better than Will Smith Or go PC Flip it and give the role to Sarah Silverman Maya Rudolph Lilly Tomlin Literally Google Search Comic Actor and you can come up with dozen of actor with better acting chop than Will Smith

Richard Croft	I honestly think Disney Films are quite literally resting on there laurel so to speak All they are doing is re hashing there Animated Classics which to Myself is a Shame Do they think Walt Disney would approve this if he were alive no he wa always forward thinking It s very similar to there Animation at the moment it s normally a Sequel which is quite sad to be honest Most of everything you see in this teaser trailer for Aladdin is just plain and simple CGI work with an actor thrown in to make it look real next year we see 3 title re hashed Aladdin Mary Poppins Dumbo which is really quite sad

Jennifer Oakes	Why isn t anyone talking about the Aladdin character at the end of this trailer played by Mena Massoud I think he look great in this teaser a Aladdin like spot on what I expected them to find in an actor appearance wise he ha it I hope he performs the role well also can steal the show because I know they re throwing in some change to the story No Rajah Jasmine s handmaiden girl played by someone from SNL that Scandinavian Prince Anders and the Jafar look quite handsome from what I understand so just sayin a for Will Smith we can t bring Robin Williams back from the dead so If anyone is gon na be genie I m glad it s Will I think he ll do fine

Fly Beep	Nice teaser but the video quality of this is kinda bad I m sure it s not noticeable on smaller screen but I m watchin this on a medium size 4k screen and it s not sharp and suffers from lot of encoding artifact Basically the video quality is trash and coming from Disney I expected better especially when visually this look great
faith krank	Ok now this look like it s going to be pretty visually and musically amazing and it might even also have a great remake of the story But I honestly miss original animation Barely any animation studio are trying to make good and original movie Everything is just remake and sequel now Nobody want to take risk anymore and honestly I feel a bit bad for the kid of this generation that don t get new magical story like generation previous Edit Okay so some people think I m hating on this just because it s not original and that s not really the case Yes there ha been original animation in the past year and yes there ha been sequel before But Disney ha been making a bunch of just live action remake And with exception to the Jungle Book they really haven t made their original proud But I m glad this is getting into a bit of conversation it s interesting seeing people view on this

vigilantezack	It s Disney it s 2018 You know Aladdin is gay Jasmine is an insufferable SJW Abu is probable a transgender and Jafar will likely be a middle age Christian white straight business owner who is the pinnacle of evil of their time The movie plot will be that Jafar want more cow farm to turn all the vegan into carnivore so global warming will raise sea level so his castle will become ocean front property Aladdin and Jasmine team up with genie to convince Jafar to understand his white privilege so that he end up giving his home to black genie for reparation Aladdin then wish for all cow to become soy plant and banana tree Global warming is thwarted and all the white people are turned into slave laborer in the soy field where they are constantly mocked and whipped with pleasure because brown people can t be racist Aladdin can t use his third wish to free genie because Jasmine think that idea sound rasist instead genie find out he wa always free but wa oppressed by the white man Jafar Aladdin then us his last wish instead to grant universal basic income free health care and free college to all citizen of Agraba who can now get free abortion without feeling guilty Apologies to Disney for giving away the plot

Zhagalchinbeka Zhagalchin	Але ебать родные где
Jch	Disney seriously can t come out with any new original story they just keep coming out with these half way decent live action adaptation I personally don t like these live action I prefer the original cartoon I just wish Disney would put their effort and money into something new and original instead of taking the exact same concept Having all these type of movie come out within just a few year really make me look down on them Cartoons have a fun and energetic feel to them and heart warming moment that I expect from a Disney movie while these adaptation are more seriouse and just bland and I don t want to see my favorite movie like that Come out with a totally new movie that will take viewer to a new world unseen before Disney pls Sorry I m just ranting at this point for whoever read this far

Natalie Harshman	I love Disney and I love Aladdin but for goodness sake so much of what they ve been doing for the past what five year ha been redoing their old animated movie in live action Not that the live action one are bad but it s just not the same sometimes you just need to leave a classic alone Or at least not redo it only 20 some year after it first came out Disney ha always had some of the best and most creative movie but simply redoing your old movie show a lack in creativity and give the impression that you re only in it for the money 😔 Nevertheless this trailer itself wa pretty good Figured I better say something else a little more positive In the grand scheme of thing there are much more important thing out there than worrying about a movie 😅 P S I m just sharing my opinion and I don t mean to offend anyone who ha a different one

Anroop Kaur	Why can t Disney make Aladdin and Jasmine look Indian Arabic or even Fijian or Pakistani I mean these character are orignally from tale of those place Each story is a bit different but it still give the similar racial feature Al lad din That is how Disney ha protrayed this character and even took away how to even say his name correctly Well I can t blame people for messing up my easy indian name if they can t say Alla Dean That might not be how it is spelled but that is how you see Alladin correctly in the orignal way I ve seen old show about Alladin in my languge and they are nothing to how they are protrayed in this movie Why can t we have any actor from the country I ve mention above play these character My cousin is a actor and in England his Indian look are accepted and he is in show I d wish these actor looked more like me I never see actor in American movie look like me dark skined dark brown hair dark brown eye and deep voice Is too much for Disney to make their character more realistic true to their origin and le sexualized so kid like my niece and little sibling can look up to them more Is it really too much to ask Disney to send a message that they can be beautiful they way they are without being more like the common Americanized Princess

Jon Nguyen	2019 real live action Disney movie Dumbo Aladdin and Lion King
turbolid	The problem with most of Disney remake it s that they want to copy 100 of the animation of nearly 78 minute into the live action of nearly 2 hour Instead of bring only the song and the iconic scene of the animation and write the live action from another point of view with new stuff like they did in the Jungle Book they do the same story and put scene with extra information about the character and the story that didn t exist in the animation in order to expand the running time to almost 2 hour like they did in Beauty and the Beast If is to tell the story in live action in the same way a in the animation the live action isn t needed because don t show something new to the animation

Thomas H Cullen	I m looking forward to this movie because I have a strong belief in magic Did the Roman Empire help the United States create the British monarchy so that outer space can see the British accent If magic worship American femininity can it be because satire isn t real Would sunlight go on vacation like a chat show host so that Christianity can have sex like a press conference If science earns the ability to see Britishness a forgiveness can Americanism ignore outer space If philosophy is the American accent of a contrast can music be a talented criticism If a Roman Emperor shuns mathematics will CNN and Fox News be unable to attend the same nightclub

Blerk Snarfgut	Aww this is a tease if ever there wa one Reminds me a lot of the Beauty and the Beast teaser where they only showed you bit and piece of the castle to give you a sense of the atmosphere but not much else I got ta say I m really liking the color palette which seems to be a great deal more subdued than the other Disney live action movie I wa expecting the Cave of Wonders to be bright and dazzling but I like how it s sort of murky almost give an underwater vibe without actually being underwater And how cool wa that shot of Iago flying over Agrabah and the Lion s head at the cave s entrance
