Skip Acuff	Kēvens ha applied his gift to the question whether Blue Wave voter are patriot I submit that Kēvens ’ video music and lyric say YES It ’ s a shot in the arm for you and a head exploder to every soul and spirit who ha been irredeemably lost to Trumpism and it enablers and ally here and abroad For those who ask “ irredeemably lost ” those who still identify their personal interest with Trump and the GOP despite or because of the event and disclosure of the Kavanaugh nomination hearing led by the oldest hardline misogynist outside of Saudi Arabia Trump ’ s relentlessly cruel persecution of folk seeking asylum from unspeakable horror in their native land the Khashoggi murder and Trump ’ s handling of the aftermath and the GOP ’ s unprecedented still ongoing avalanche of lie soaked propaganda during the campaign for the November 6 2018 midterm election Friends unless we prevail and preserve the patriotism depicted in Kēvens video America will for the foreseeable future lose it pre Trump reputation still not fully earned a the land of the free home of the brave of truth justice and the American Dream The WH ’ s recent statement that the Saudis ’ version of the Khashoggi murder i e that he brought fist to a bone saw fight is credible ha earned u the contempt of rational democracy minded people throughout the world Let ’ s show the world that the Trump fiasco is a fluke that we ’ re so much better than that and that the majority of u want preserve the uniquely American aspiration displayed in Kēvens ’ song and poignant imagery PLEASE send “ Sweet Lady Liberty ” to everyone in your social network and urge them to do the same ad infinitum Believe a veteran protester of the Viet Nam war during the late 60 and early 70 protest music doe reach and motivate people to act This too is part of our American heritage
