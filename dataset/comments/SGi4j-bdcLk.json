He has called upon me in the past, and I have answered eagerly.  I have given him my house.  My wife.  My first born son.  All in efforts to obtain the enemy intelligence.  But this?  The final straw on the already much overburdened camel‚Äôs back.  I have thought much on this, and believe I am able to definitively say: as he sits there, eating his sandvich and occasionally pressing the right two buttons in order to spam pootis, this man plots against us all.  I will no longer support him in his efforts to obtain the enemy intelligence.  Mommy always told me: ‚ÄúSon, in the event that you are presented with a dilemma which involves completing the objective by way of great self sacrifice but those who gave their promise do not deliver, you must take matters into your own hands, swing wildly at everything that moves, assume anything could be a spy, and when you are clear of doubt, turn to your hoovy teammate and state:  ‚Äòmy good sir, if you are unable to capture the intelligence while ubered, kritzkreiged, and supported by your scout, you are undeserving of my full support.‚Äù  I have never forgotten those exact words, and today I will follow by their meaning.  Heavy from Team Fortress 2, you have asked too much of me, one man, and have therefore discredited yourself in my eyes.  I will no longer support your consistently futile efforts to capture the enemy intelligence, and I will not give you my strange Ghostly Gibbus, it is mine and I will guard it with my life.  Likewise I will for my Club Penguin account password.
