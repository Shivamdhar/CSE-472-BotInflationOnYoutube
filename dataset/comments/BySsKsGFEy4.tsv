Right Side Broadcasting Network	Original version of this with over 350,000 views was blocked by YouTube because 20 seconds of the song "FREEBIRD" from the PA system at the rally leaked through onto the video. When trying to remove the song from the video we get the message "You cannot edit this video because it has too many views." Stupid.
HighPriestess	I want a "My Pillow" so bad. 1:33:13
Layna8	THANKYOU, RIGHT SIDE, FOR ALL YOU DO FOR THE REPUBLIC...;)
Andy	I love that sweet twang in Alyssa's voice.Liz is awesome too.Seeing such lovely young ladies with their act together gives me hope for America's future.We need a lot more of it.
TheCladi8or	Here's a real president,  not a FAKE, make believe color biased idiot .(obama)
]Last Word[	When the President said we don't worship government, we worship God; the President pointed at me in the crowd.(starting @4:04:00) Where we go one, we go all.
Robert Schulz	Where in the video did the 20 seconds of music play I can't find it.
Stephen Harden	Thank you all at RSBN I was one of the 350,000 people watching the original video from Wenatchee Wa USA
Sjef Hoefs	Watching from Germany. May the light of civilization come back to Europe too.
Chair Happy	Screw Nazitube, one day they will get theirs, when they do the wrong thing, karma will teach them a lesson.  It might not be tomorrow or next week, but it will happen one day!!!
Kevin R	Why did YouTube block original version????  Oh, nvm.  So a song snuck into the video and you can't edit it while it is going viral so YouTube just removes it!!! ridiculous
Barrett Kettle	YouTube blocking you pissed me off!
maggie mae	Rsbn your the best thanks for reload watched original maga from down under
Maddy Perennity	Eff YouTube. I'd spit in their faces. Thanks for putting it back up, RSBN.
Liver NC	I was looking for full clip but couldn't find. Thanks for uploading again.
Candy Smith	RSBN - No top chat replay on this video?  It's fun seeing the chatters talking while it's playing too. I guess maybe since the original video was blocked that's not feasible.  It was fabulous to meet the ground team in person and my interview with Alyssa was so fun!  Love you RSBN!!! BTW I vote for a new Youtube....TrumpTube with no conservative sensoring.   VOTE RED MY FELLOW TEXANS!
Kelvin Boyd	awesome rally. is it just me or Ted Cruz taking speech lessons from Trump LOL
fakecubed	Obviously everyone should queue up this video again, play it several times, until the number of views are back to where they should be.
lemoncrinckles	Look at all those beautiful patriots!
Walter McLean	I watched all full 7 plus hours. Now I was watching it and then as Donald Trump's son's wife was on the stage I saw the screen go black and then come back on I knew something was wrong and I but it continue to play just after that it came back on. This is just a whole bunch of b******* as I said in a message yesterday on your post video when the four of you and your boss was on there I suggested that they need to produce and form their own platforms we all need to get our own conservative Platforms in our society it's got to the point or they need to be broken up like AT&T was broken up in the 1980s. Does any of you old enough to know when you had to wait in a long line to get inside an AT&T store to get an old rotary phone. And finally the government broke them up it is surprising how decades later more than several Generations AT&T is come back and bought Cingular cell phone company and it got into their glommer even larger then they were in the old rotary phone. Now some of you probably read this are probably considering that she has your great-great-grandparents. I remember when my grandmother on my father's side had to pick up the little thing and we lit around and get the operator and connecting the line something you would see in an old 1800 1900 black and white movie this was still happening in the 1970s the old style thing you put to your ear and you speak in the wall.
Donald J. Trump	YouTube is cucked. All of these major liberal companies are including Twatter, Facebook, etc
Brucev7	It was something. 100,000 applied for Tickets. KAG
LMVP Truth in Facts	Wow my pillow guy
Blindfury B	Dear youtube: what you are doing to rsbn really shows how crazy you are. But thanks for helping the red wave to roll along. Keep it up YouTube, keep it up....
mike miller	Glad to see this edited version got posted. I think using 2 cameras with split screen display was a great idea . That rally will possibly be the highlight of all rallys this midterm. I saw over 54,000 viewers on YouTube during the RSBN broadcast. Thanks for your effort and perseverance to make this possible.
Mom Rosen	Play patriotic songs......end of problem, and they are picking on you because you are the only ones showing the crowds.. Thank you for all you do.
Eddie Dahle	Beware the fake news.  They are trying to stop our voting by -playing mind games.   Polls don‚Äôt count.  Remember the spirit of 2016.
Rob Montana	‚ÄúGod Bless America‚Äù And ‚ÄúGod Bless Our President ‚Äú Donald J Trump ‚Äú üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Kim Styles	350,000 and I was one. Congratulations! No wonder you're getting canceled Main Street Media can't compete with you if you're going to take them out
ughwhat	Watching from Australia! Unfortunately had to watch fox 10 livestream yesterday as yours was blocked and it was weird like they mess with the sound of everything
Washington Hoax	The best in AI from the empire of Google - more like the movies Idiocrary or Brasil. It's artificial stupidity. So all errors can be blamed on the perfect system. The same stupid AI audio pattern recognition of music could also block the music within 4 bars of detection.
WillieG	PENNSYLVANIA FOR TRUMP!
mbcris	How is it that CNN can broadcast over the same song, post it to YT and not get dinged?
Rob Cj	I've had it with YouTube. After the midterms I'm slowing my use to a stop with some time.  Y'ALL need to find another way to spread the news.
CosmicMonkey33	Thank you for all you do!  WWG1WGA..............
Live Free	In England we had a widespread youtube outage about 5 minutes before the President took the stage in Texas yesterday. An influential Youtuber was also interviewing a senior UKIP member at the same time. The Corporate Globalists are censoring us all.
Terr Rebell	Doest the PA music also leak into the videos of the major networks ?  Were they treated as unfairly as RSBN?  YT is definately exposing their bias and unequal treatment to a select groups of content creators.  Thankyou for the hard work and effort the entire RSBN family puts into providing us with quality reporting and coverage. Great work, thankyou.
Axel Ferguson	Love right side of broadcasting always use you guys for live streaming trump events
silly sicily	One Libercunt dislikes maga rally üòÇ
Zero Sum	See if they are implementing policy on fake news MSM channels that broadcast rally. If not, you have evidence for a case to sue.
SamE	SO SICK of You Tube with their EVIL, INDEFENSIBLE operation!!!!
Juan Carlos	YouTube is a disgrace!! I really hope justice comes to them soon.
Mark McKinley	I am so sorry RightSide. This should not have happened. That is why I donate on Patron. YouTube SUCKS !!
Adam D.	They took down your video because it was TRENDING. Good work. Stick to it, we will win with persistence vs censorship
yy Wong	Amazing rally! A great man! Thanks RSBN for the re-upload
Trump2020	How pathetic. This is Youtube's way of meddling in the elections. Hell , they wouldn't block any of the other Democrat rallies . It disgusts me ,  of course Youtube is owned by a liberal company and CEO.
HEADBANGRR	WE NEED TO START "ANOTHER" TUBE WITH A DIFFERENT, BETTER NAME! I'VE GOT THE CORRECT NAME ALREADY.  I'LL NAME IT WHEN I START IT!  :-)  Thank you!
trueboss926	You should file a lawsuit against Youtube.
Yus Hulu Langat	Finally!!!!
garbut	Would like to say that after the Tommy Robinson trial was adjourned at the Old Bailey in London today and Tommy appeared outside to thank the thousands who had turned up in support......at one point the crowd spontaneously chanted "TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP & USA USA USA."...It was incredible and I think it was a huge "Thank You" to all the Americans who have supported Tommy.......Thank you USA and MAGA and best wishes to the REPS on November 6.
Casandra Portugal	üëçüèª back up getting my popcorn üçø and watching it again
