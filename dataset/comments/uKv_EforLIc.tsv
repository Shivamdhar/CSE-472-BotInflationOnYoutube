Terence Tan	This guy gets better every year! Indeed the face of the franchise
crx sent on6	Wow! A point guard dishing out assists, with zero turnovers, stealing the ball several times, and shooting threes without a miss. Did I say point guard? No, it's a center!

Plague inc and glitch	I was at this game
Nana  Dankwah	Got me 62 point on fantasy, this guy a beast!
Malachi Washington	Did that dude just say”first team that scores,wins” ?

dankmemes lol	westbrook would get this stat line through shooting 60 shots and stat padding lol
FaZe DuCk	...Steroid Check IMMEDIATELY
Colin McCreary	Jokic makes no sense.  You watch him play, and he looks like he should be outclassed.  He's out of shape, unathletic, and slow, but somehow gets it done with his vision and dexterity.  Guy is an absolute monster, breaks my brain every time I watch him play.
Paolo Nigra	well this is presea... oh wait!
Soulblaze15	Easy Alpha Dog Badge
Marko R	This was history , the most efficient game EVER PLAYED BY A PLAYER IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL! Wilt had 2 games close to this also with perfect shooting but wilt has allways missed 4–5 free throws . Its only a shame that the national us media doesnt give a fuck for greatness

Nikola Vasic	Bravo majstore pišaj po glupim amerima

elterrible john	Jokic, so underrated
Uros Bukovec	Jokič superstar
liu travis	I think it'll become a trend for every centre in the league to have the best performance of the year against Suns, Ayton is really really good offensively but on the defending end he has no idea where to go and what to do.
Rk	Fucking beast
Reginald Nixon	Either he's that good or the Sun's are that bad......might be a combination of the two.....but a hell of a performance.....I smell a all-star this year
Vladan stevanovic	Man he just wrote history. Second player in NBA history recording a perfect triplle double over 30 point.  In his young age.
Stoned JR	They did him dirty in the thumbnail
Abraham Guillen	Mvp candidate.
Remmark Sunga	i love his game, reminds u of Tim Duncan outside of his passes Jokic just seems so plain and the defense seems to relax when he has the ball cause he takes his time and slows down the tempo all the while looking for the best way to score
DeVarion	dem fantasy points this nigga just gave me lol #Changehisnickname #Serbgod
Timothy Riviera	And people still claim Towns and Porzingis are better.  Give this man his respect.
Luke FO	When you turn up the sliders at 2k
ThaProfetPR	with a smidge more of agility he gonna be a real problem for teams cuz his fundamentals are solid and this stat line is definitely one of the most impressive I've seen especially from a 5... damn a perfect game is just baffling
THENKINGMr	The Joker is just fucking ridiculous at this point
Keon Leonard	Dudes like this are the guys I’m a fan of because they just get the job done no extra fuckery ie dame lillard and kawhi
Αποστολης Κοτλης	He makes it look easy bruhh
