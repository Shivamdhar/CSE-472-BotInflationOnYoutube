Sam Maki	Been watching the last 2 weeks, 90% of Chris's goals are pure luck, random corner headers that aren't timed, outside the box random shots that aren't timed (which should always miss because you should be punished for not timing your finishes), lucky bobbles. Idk, he never sets up play or tacticfully attacks goal, just through balls, hits it and hopes. I'd be tilted if I lost to him because of the luck.

OJD Dovey	Jesus scored not Maldini 😂😂
Cal Ludwig	4 things: 1. Chris play Fred at left CM as it allows Gerrard play in the middle or on the right 2. "Prime or nothing", Maldini is not a prime icon 3. The ability to change tactics and formation during the game is one of the biggest assets of this FIFA, the amount of games you can win with tactical nous is incredible. Set a default starter formation, and then have two more attacking variations(could include a change of formation or jus tactics) and two more defensive. 4. Move away from the Prem, eg: Chris could sell Cannavaro, play Maldini on the left, use Courtois and Varane, and play Stevie G on the right to keep Walker on full chemistry

Junaid Rashid	the fact that chris thinks she should have won because he had more shots is so stupid the fact that the majority of his shot were outside the box and woyuld never have been goals but matt had less shots the they were much better opportunities and when chris cries about never having any luck I just think wtf he is the most luckiest fifa player every ball drops 2 him and he scores basically every corner
