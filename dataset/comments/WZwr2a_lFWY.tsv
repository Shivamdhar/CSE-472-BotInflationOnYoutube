Othep	I don't know what's the true intention in uploading CLC's vid but its clearly CUBE is doing them dirty, so that SOME cheshires will somehow attack IZ*ONE. This is clearly not CLC or IZ*ONE's fault. Maybe CUBE's threathened so its using desperation tactics now huh? 🤔  please don't let these controversies affect us, these are just diversionary tactics that wants to slow IZ*ONE to fame. lets just keep on streaming WIZ*ONEs 🔥🔥🔥

If is about the CLC controversy, just write that isn´t IZ*ONE fault, is CUBE fault for bad promoting their groups.  Don´t attack CLC. Lets be better.

Azyah C	I don't understand the people who say "At first I was jealous" or "At first I didn't like them because [ other GIRL GROUP] deserves more recognition".  Can K-pop fans not like more than one group without it being a big deal?? Damn

Echo Ryu	it looks like the fridge is filled with a lot of meat and flesh. but on the second look its roses. AM I THE ONLY ONE
Вікторія Ковлева	You can shower me with slippers, but I don’t like them. I do not understand why so much noise. I do not like groups with a lot of participants, because there will always be an advantage for several girls, and others for dancers. I just do not see anything new in their debut. This is my opinion, please respect it and react like adults.
Sekretaris ESP	Eunbi looks like mix of Joy and Irene, so pretty! Anyway, Yuri really captures my eyes and ears! happy first win! #IZONE1STWIN #LaVieEnRose1stWin

chansaur	CHAEWON IS FELIX'S LOST SISTER CHANGE MY MIND
Concessa_The_Chan's_Wifeu _	I honestly didn't have any expectations from them because the previous produce 101 groups didn't leave any impressions on me. I expected a cringey debut (my bad) But damn!!! I'm in love with this song!!!!  Also all of them shine in their own way!!! Btw who's that girl singing @0:45?  Love her voice!!!!!! Also the centre really fits the role!!!! Iz*one hwaiting!!! This is coming from a non-fan ( might turn into one soon)

You're already university student by now I guees, good luck. :)  Yourself, 30/10/18 10:37pm NZ time

cutedreamer 1215	Do you know the feeling when you are liking the group, songs and all their shits but then u spotted many immature fans? It's really disappointing, IZ*ONE is still not that huge and also their fanbase but their fanbase is already starting off as immature, hate me, that will prove your immaturities damn the group is awesome though but those motherfuckers aren't. I ain't playing games here.

Landair Heaven Jean Luz	Credit to the songwriter and producer! Amazing song! I like most of the Izone members but not all of them. I'm rooting for Minjoo, Yena, Sakura, Nako and Hitomi mostly. 😆😆 I respect Eun Bi, Chae Yeon and Yuri for their undoubtable talent. Wonyoung and Yujin are pretty and talented, yes, but not my cup of tea. Hyewon is... I'll keep silent. I was proud and impressed at first but... Oh well. Chae won's nose bothering me since day 1. No hate please. We all have our own preferences in beauty and tastes. Anyways, this is quite nice! So so outstanding for a debut song! It'll take them places for sure! 😊  And now I am on standby whether a second group of PD48 trainees will debut next! I hope Miru, Chowon, Ga Eun and Do Ah could be included. Chances are slim but oh my, if it happens! 😍😍

I know why, the song has that Red red hot Latino passion fused with Kpop saprano the band also have a Jisoo blackhair look alike visual! Oh my.😚 I also feel the SNSD li touch  choreography in this video.  For now I*zone  don't quite have the idol pulling power like Blink but the song speaks for itself as good as Apink's amazing - I am sick of lying and  Mamason's Baam - perfect for dance. A great song the South American fans would get derilum over this number.😋

ROSE	Honestly I've never been a huge fan of K-pop. I only stanned two bands and by most people's standards that's not enough to be a K-pop fan. One of those bands disbanded, the other lost members and it doesn't feel the same. So I guess I thought I left liking any K-pop band behind but NOPE. I'm in love with this group!!!!

a Slytherin	I bet if this song was flop and not doing well , nobody will care . This song is popular not because it is la vie en rose,but because of IZONE..as their fan, whatever song they debuted with, we will stream and support..  Just a genuine question,will this song charted high,break any record or sales 80 k as IZONE  ,if this were given to clc? U guys complaint and feel disappointed as u guys thought it will boost up their popularity but no dearie,it was this popular because IZONE is the one that promote it. Even they debut with O My,the achievement will be as same as la vie en rose..again,because of IZONE..

Alessandro H.	I'm happy Chaeyeon gets to debut with Sakura. I'm happy Minju's apart of this group along with Yujin and Yena. I'm glad Yuri's here. I'm happy at least there are three Japanese girls here; Nako and Hitomi. I like Eunbi but not as much near the end of produce (she's too driven but then again it's her last chance). Not a big fan of Chaewon till the end, but she can contribute. Wonyoung? Yeah hi, but not gonna get my support. Hyewon? Oh lord.

The dance, the song, their height 😆 I have little to no idea of the labels or the "Produce48" where they came from tbh, but this is definitely one of the promising groups I'll be watching out from now on. Prettiest for me: Eunbi, Sakura, Yujin, Wonyoung (can't choose one 😰) Best vocal color: Yuri 😱💛  #Kyungsootrash_EXO-L💞
렌튕희희	조유리 😍
The Wanderer	Hello, all ^_^   With all the love and adulation that IZ*ONE has received from this debut song, we may appreciate this timely reminder:  Please be careful when using words and phrases that contain "sexy" or other sexual connotation for the group because (as of Nov 7, 2018) only six of the members are adults of international ages (18-year-olds Chaewon and Chaeyeon; 19-year-olds Yena and Hyewon; Sakura, 20; and Eunbi, 23).  The remainder members are still underaged according to international ages: Minju, Nako, Hitomi and Yuri are 17, Yujin is 15, and maknae Wonyoung is 14.  Anyhow, may the group continue to reap success in future.

Raven Kane	the girl in that psy video was better
MelodyCheshiresUniverse	True. This is clc type of song. But we cannot deny how this girls slayed their debut song. This is not about who sang best, but the issue is how rude cube make clc suffer throughout the months. Im in journey through clc update. Yes in may june they keep talking about comeback and the possible concept, they even have the choreograph which they always hinted. Probably they practice and record the song but it turns out it was given to other group which is very upsetting.   It does not mean you are not popular you will have no right to be respected for your hardwork? Cube do bad at them really a bad one. I hate this kind of disrespectful. Hope with my girls they will be known for their next comeback, when it is, never of cheshires knows but for almost 4years we will still believe in clc because talents is what they had, and if we believe we succeed.   Thank you Izone for singing this song. It suit you well. Dont mind other fake cheshires who always complain and judge other group but did not fully support clc when their is comeback. Im sure they are not true cheshires.   Congrats for the debut

sarangeun da ra ta ta ta	actually i don't know what could've happened if CLC sang this song. listening to the demo, i can't get the feels. and everyone's making a big deal out of those demos. the producer sold the song to OTR because according to some sources, that producer left CUBE. and honestly speaking, La Vie en Rose wouldn't have made it big if CLC sang it because people would still sleep on it.
jcatl	Favs...Wonyoung & Eunbi!

결백한 혜원	*20M where ya at*
Stewie Zhou	What I like the most about the song is that the song title would mostly be thought of elegant (I think like that at least) (The elegance of the title...sort of) but they pulled it off into more of a cute concept. Certainly didn't feel like an debut! HWAITING!!!!
hekel kuman	after seeing their show-con, i really want to see the dance practice
Carl Jay Arellano	Actually they are soooo many that the members can be narrowed down into this:  1. Eunbi*- Leader, Lead Vocal 2. Chaeyeon*- Dance, Performance 3. Yena*- Rap 4. Yujin* or Woonyoung- Maknae, Face of the Group, Subvocal 5. Yuri* or Chaewon- Main Vocal 6. Sakura* or Minju or Hyewon- Visual, Subvocal 7. Nako* or Hitomi- Subvocal, the Cute member 😁  This group can actually exist with 7 members only. Luhhh
JW	Just found that the group is from Produce 48 and that's why the members are all evenly shining.
dk 17	I don't know why... I'm love their song and their visuals and voice.. Even i dont really watch produce48

Tasya Taso	Guys, WIZ*ONE supposed to be the wise one Don't get into fanwar and just simply report those inappropriate comment in every official video
Victoria Seo	Are those manolos at 1:50?? Whoa
Melissa	Can someone explain to me how this came to be it's not hate btw I'm just genuinely confused my question is, why did release a song in korean & not Japanese was that planned out or is it just a temporary thing? I'm confused I didn't watch produce 101 so you could only imagine how confused I am. EDIT: OOOPS I just realized that it's produce 48 not produce 101 😳 lol
Luis Arzolai	CLC :( FUCK CUBE
Dreamcatcher's Dami deep voice in Full Moon	They're a really good gg and I liked the MV, but, as a Cheshire, I am still lowkey mad at Cube for selling CLC's comeback song. (Note that I'm mad at CUBE, not at Wiz*ones or the group itself, 'kay?) I wish we could see them singing it, at least once.

Lucio Fascopoci	Sakura is my bias and i used to be sad that she only got view line. But after watching some live performances, i started to understand that she might not ready yet to get more line ( since she mostly lip sync, probably due to language barrier or vocal techniques idk). I hope she will improve more during 2.5 years. Sakura fighting!!!! Ganbatte kudasai!!!
Zedekiah Bell	I want to be honest with everyone, at first I was a hater. I felt as if IZ*ONE was getting more recognition than any other girl group including lOONA. I felt upset and troubled, but now I see differently. I want to be happy and supportive, because at first being mean (which I was) will get you no where. I am excited that my girls are getting recognition, and now it is IZ*ONE time to be in the spotlight. I am a proud ORBIT & WIZ*ONE, good day to everyone❤️

silver girl	The song was originally meant to be clc's comeback...and they even recorded it https://youtu.be/Rl9zO8MBq_4 I don't hate on izone, but this is so unfair to clc, the long awaited comeback of this amazing group was simply given to a rookie group, this is so tragic actually...

Bts_Fighting_Jamless Kookie	Thanks the Ads for the views
Sevda BTS	I LOVE THIS OMG PLEASE
Yurim Lee	This is ironic because la vie en rose means life in pink but they are talking about actually rose and the colour red
Léa Sr	Why... did they base the entire first verse and the whole mv on the colour red when the title means life in pink? I think the directors legit thought the word rose was for the flower but... No big deal of course but I would’ve love a mv full of various pink tones or maybe have a pink filter since Edith Piaf « saw life in pink » in her song. Would’ve been so aesthetically pleasing 😳 love the song though I’ll definitely keep an eye on them
Heleena Khalik	Beautiful and talented.love the song and the clothes.
David Salazar	Yes or yes xD
Arnau Gómez Del Campo	Why? Just why
i spilled my tae on my bias list	What’s with their legs

sharon	so when was stray kids felix in a girl group?
emma	i found out today that yujin and wonyoung are younger than me... honestly, what have i even been doing with my life...
夜空林	Wrong way of using such an eccentric and classical song title as a kpop title… I’m not even surprised why this has lots of unlikes.
Bern Pri	do these girls have work done on their face? because they all look the same (except for a couple) and its not because i can't tell the difference, i watch other kpop bands.. theses girls all have the same face (again except for a few)
_Roxy Amelia_	Chaewon really does look like Felix.
Potayo algija Hoppus	Lets go wezonee
sara BTS	Que lindas wey :'v
Rasmina Niyasudeen	Is it me or I find it difficult to chose a bias since they all look so pretty

전정곤	*IZ*ONE's debut song is so good, melodious and French-like.😀😀💕💕💋*
Ryan Kim	これから頑張れ!
thandi mfula x	i’m happy they debuted yo
Watashiwa Riza	please don't spread hatred. no one is guilty in this case. it all depends on management, to whom they want to give the song, that's their right. I'm not defending CLC or IZ * ONE, only ... thinking badly and accusing one group of being a thief is illogical. they know nothing, all management plans. but everyone accused them of being the cause of the failure of the CLC comback group. I think this problem does not need to be extended, and it would be nice to stop spreading CLC's La Vie En Rose video. stop spreading hatred. I know, there are haters hidden here, I tell you, the more 'Haters' drop a group, the more fun their future will be.
Fimel Chayara	I.love they so much!
Xolo Rubí	La vie en 🌹, J'adoré cette chanson
Caro Efron	So many members😮
2saif4u	FUN FACT: La Vie en Rose means life in pink, and in french, "life in pink" is a metaphor for saying "life being perfect and enjoyable"
The keeper of jams	was on my recommended and im glad it was this is a good song bros.

Dwiki Ferdiansyah	lee chaeyeon ~
saltvy	**i am not hating on izone with this comment**  i've gotten a bit tired of seeing comments that say "even if this was clc's song it wouldn't have that much success because they aren't popular" because that statement isn't exactly true. for example, DIA who debuted in 2015 (clc also debuted in 2015) got their first win this year. another example, WJSN debuted in 2016 and also got their first win this year. yes, the popularity of the group does have to do with the success of the song, but the song quality and style is most important. woo woo and save me, save you were the songs that got DIA and WJSN their first win. the songs attracted more fans, meaning more people helped vote and purchase albums. if clc came back with la vie en rose, they may have gotten their first win. once again, i'm not hating on izone nor trying to start fanwars. as a cheshire, i'm trying to help everyone understand why cheshires are angry. this song could have gotten clc recognition, but izone were also able to make this song work.  i apologize for the long comment, but i hope both izone and clc are able to become successful.
Jean Brinye	#1 trending in PH :)

Liliana Ruiz	hello, im a fellow cheshire. we are very very sorry for the hate our fandom is giving iz one. im not a hater. but us cheshires really wanted a clc come back and we got so much hope but the come back got sold. this song is really catchy and i hope this group becomes a success!! us cheshires can help stream this song of you can help stream black dress by clc!! lots of love by cheshires 🐱❤

cheshire -	even if each members of this girlsband are cute, i’m still thinking about the fact that the song was destined for CLC. they’re working hard for finally this.  ****** guys, I didn't say anything mean or hateful to Izone. don't think that all Clc fans don't like this band, we're just sad for Clc. if it happened to a band you cared about a lot, you'd react in the same way. I don't comment to belittle Izone, I comment to express my opinion. I don't blame Izone members, I just feel bad for Clc's.  https://youtu.be/jjgpcRdGxbU

Clodus Tay	I wish iz*one will be a multi-concept group ~ having every comeback with different styles.  one thing I like about survival shows idol group is that their entire group mostly visuals, so appealing to watch their mv.

Adam & Daniel	Kwon Eunbi got plastic surgery? Because she was in another kpop group called CLC and if you search Kwon Eunbi in CLC SHE CHANGED SO MUCH!
HyangNam Flash	히토미♡♡
Heartu Heartu	I'm also a Cheshire but after I saw all the comment here I feel sorry for WIZ*ONE (I'm a WIZ*ONE too), Can we be more Mature Cheshire (those who complains) , Stop being so Immature, we can't change the situation now, just get prepared for the next album and buy /stream to let our CLC BABIES get their first win on the next comeback  And those who say CLC / IZ*ONE / any other group sucks, there are no group that sucks or bad , all of the kpop group work hard for their debut / comeback  It's a struggle when u are a multifandom and both of ur fandom you're in are having wars
Dahyun's Nostrils	They didn't looked rookie group to me..
Bruce Tan	As a wiz, I am tired of the whole "CLC incident" which only bring negativity to iz*one. Do you really think cube management watch/read/follow la vie en rose mv? I don't think so. Cheshire should start "CLC Yes Movement", stream their mv, buy their album, support them up the chart, tweet support message and trend them till Cube cannot ignore CLC and Cheshire and when their new comeback released, show them all the love and support that they need and not the comparison with another idol group which they obviously don't need.

musen296	Although i have my fair share of problems with this group and how it came to exist, they really went and transformed Minju into Tzuyu level holy shit. I'm not even kidding, why does she look so good?  Stylists know what the fuck they're doing god bless.    Also I'm really happy about her confidence boost, hope it spreads to Hyewon as well. I wouldn't have placed either of them in my top12 but really hope they do well now!

성민	eunbi is beautiful
Eya Lee	I think both groups are suit in this song. But I'm glad that the izone gets the song. I don't think clc can afford to comeback with this kind of concept after black dress. They should just stick with the girl crush concept. I think if they do that, they will get the recognition they deserve.

강소닉	La Vie en Rose,  This song is the modified Moombahton Trap style of the Electro-House line affiliation and the SHITAO MIU of Hi Performance. SHITAO MIU style very well match... It's so sad... But I believe Sakura and Hitomi will do well..........
Jiminniepabo	The chorus seems pretty underwhelming? Love the pre-chorus though.

andre febra	give sakura another minute view please. but this song is daebakk
Arluna Cantayani	This is the first time I'm not feeling bored listening + watching the same music video so many times.  The song and the arrangement already good. But their voices blended so well it makes the song sounds soft and easy to listen to. The video aesthetic and beautiful colors makes it pleasant to watch. This is by far one of the best ears and eyes catchy song and MV. A perfect match  Oh also the choreo is one of the best formation so far, It's like a blooming flower. Also it feels gentle but powerful  The members tho.. I love their visuals and their height variation..what a diverse group

Stefan	Cheshires, pls stop. Yes the song was sold. But when looking at Instagram it kinda looks like Seungyeon is teasing a party esque comeback.  Izone deserve this song, they got it because their company bought it and they did the song justice.  We all know that waiting for your fav group's comeback is tedious but it's enough.   Izone fighting, and hopefully this song can do good for the group.

I THOUGHT IZ*ONE WAS ALREADY AN EXISTING GROUP AND HAD ALREADY MADE A NUMBER OF SONGS BEFORE THIS ONE  WELL...DOUBLE WOW. THESE GIRLS ARE JUST SO TALENTED, I SWEAR.

She is so gorgeous. ) 2.Sakura (She is too attractive I can't take my eyes of her.) 3.Yena (Everything is gold for her) 4.Chaewon (All around player) 5.Jo Yuri (Her voice is really unique and she has sex appeal) 6.Won Young (Perfect idol) 7.Hye Won (She has been doing great in her role) 8.Eun-Bi 9.Yu-jin 10.Hitomi 11.Nako

Steven WBT	stop comparing them with CLC. Their producers left the entertainment and its their right to give or sell it to iz*one. Same like Energetic-Wannaone. Its supposed to be Hui’s Pentagon, but Cube give it to StoneE. Each of them have their own features. Both of them are extremely talented. Iz*one has a cute + more to energetic features while CLC has a sexy and also energetic features. If u guys hear it carefully, Iz*one’s LaVieEnRose and CLC’s, they have a different lyrics (which maybe a different meaning(?)) *sorry for my ugly english hehe ❤️

WIz*One eye on iz*one	Hello, i am a fan in vietnam, although i am far from korea but i am always interested and watching korean idols, i watch produce 101 season 1 and produce 48 (i do not watch Season 2 because I'm a boy), I have been waiting for each episode was translated into Vietnamese. I really like ioi and iz*one, i'm very happy to see i.o.i success and also regret when the group disbanded, but the feeling of happiness once again came back when i saw iz*one debut, when watching PD101 and PD48 I know the members are so hard working for their passion, they are young but passion and talented, 11 pieces of ioi and wanna one will never forget in my heart and everyone, and now 12 pieces of iz*one will continue to do the same thing. Thanks because i being born in this age so that i can meet and know talented people like that. Thanks i.o.i wanna one and iz*one. I will follow and support iz*one as well as other kpop groups.

N ava	สวดยอด👍
Duong Nguyen	phần của sakura ít quái
Hamburger Helper	Oh boy, I'm not really sure how I feel about this song. The pre chorus is absolutely bopping! It got me so hyped when I first heard it and I was excited for the chorus. And then the chorus came and...meh. I feel like the momentum from the pre chorus didn't carry into the chorus. It builds you up, and then nothing happens.  Otherwise, the song is a very cute song. The girls have excellent vocals and their voices fit perfectly together! ❤ This is my first time hearing about them, are they rookies? They sing like they have been in the music industry since the day they were born! Hopefully their next song will capture my interest because I can already tell these girls are talented and I don't want to miss a single second of their rising stardom! 😍

Frankly i was kinda sad and mad when i found out that this song supposed to be clc comeback. But i literally changed my mind when i checked on izone. Sad to be true that izone successfully made this song WELL-EXECUTED and MASTERPIECE with their powerful visuals and talents. Special mention for that irene’s child, ah i mean kwon eunbi tho. why is she being so powerful for this era? Dayum girl. MAD TALENT & VISUAL

Theswedetwins	Guys CLC are already struggling, their fans said some dumb stuff but don’t make fun of them and stop being rude, it’s understandable that they’re salty. Also, most of the comments are telling them to stop hating while there’s very little hate left here, it feels like you’re taking it too far
Nepurr	I love this song, even if I didnt already like this group, the song would still be amazing!! Everyone got highlighted nicely and their looks were awesome!!!

Véronique Marceau	Great song, soo sad to ear such a bad prononciation of "la vie en rose"./ Bonne chanson, c'est triste d'entendre une aussi mauvaise prononciation de "la vie en rose". Je suis francophone et j'ai du tendre l'oreille pour réellement comprendre le propos des chanteuses.

Bangtan Trash	IM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG❤️
FRΣSH	To be honest, their voices fit this song so well, especially when Sakura sang La La La La Vie en Rose it was like a breeze just transitioning into the drop. I hope we get to hear their singing skills more in future songs, I really like them!

Aya_no48	/sorry for mistakes, english isn't my native language :с/  I'm Cheshire and I'm really sorry for some... rude people in my fandom. We don't hate Iz*one - they are a good girls and we wish them only succes. But now we really mad to Cube because our girls was waiting for comeback, they always talked "We are working for new song" and now they very depressed because they doesn't even know when they will comeback. Cube's actions very rude and we just want respect for CLC. And again - sorry for rudeness of some people, Iz*one don't deserve it.
Waroot J	despite the fact that i dont like a lot of members this song is so good... i was ready to hate them too but its so good lol
Izzyzle	*I LOVE THIS SONG AND THIS MV* 😍❤️
Thorns Gaming	Like I love them all and everything, but this was gonna be CLCs and what I thought was if they got this comeback, would they be more popular?

Mellinda Yunieta	Im crying rn... babies😭😭😭😭
Kasu mi	I love Sakuras name
Kameel Rejal	Regarding CLC’s song issue I THINK WE should not blame CLC they are not guilty.
WIZ*ONE Jo	I think the one who we should blame is the one who leaked the clc demo version of la vie en rose.    I mean, that's just so disrespectful to leak that video when these deserving girls just debuted. They just want to make an issue out of it and sadly, they succeeded with those people who cannot accept that this song already belongs to IZ*ONE. They owned it and killed it.  Anyway, those haters just add views and even made an effort to comment on this mv so thanks.
DAVID FOREVER	idk first time i just ignored this song but now i just fell in love with this song. help this song is stuck in my head😣

ஜ 아나시아 ஜ	Olleh~~~ I am flying~~
Hina Trist	La Vie en Rose is well composed. However, the main reason of La Vie en Rose successful launch is IZ*ONE. I don't know why CLC fans bring so much hate here. They were the one who chose first and also chose to give up La Vie en Rose.
Pnd 2	1:31 "All IZ*ONE me" Clever... 😂
hocus pocus	yuri made a mistake at 0:48 lol
イサク2	みんな可愛いグループ
°Byeol°	I don't know if I'm the only one, but I am REALLY frustrated about the concept.. I mean la Vie en Rose means "Life in pink" so the whole theme is just wrong! From the video colours to the actual lyrics.. I guess they thought about "Rose" as the flower, which is red, but I mean, you don't need to be French (because I'm not) to know that La vie an rose is not about roses, especially if you base a music project about it 😅 Probably I'm just a little too extreme about this, but I guess I am a perfectionist.. It really irritates me 😂 But the girls are amazing and I love the song!
Jaz Pang	well i thought wizone was a nice fandom but i just read the comment section and im disappointed  ,, just like ever fandom there are . immature people what did i expect anyways
Ciel kim	I hope they could be more close with each other..😊 Strong friendship can make the group stronger...

Quỳnh Park	I get that this is noone's fault, CLC nor Izone, but please stop the "iF thIs sOnG iS SunG bY Clc iT wOlUdn't Be aS fAmoUs aS IzoNe" shit. CLC is one hell of a talented group, it is bad enough for them to both get robbed (of this song) and get slept on (their reputation). Be considerate for their fans, they just want a comeback from their idol like everyone else and suddenly realize that "wow, this song should have been OUR comeback song". Yes, throwing shades towards Izone is wrong, but for wizone (idk if I spell correctly) to throw shades back on CLC and their fans is doubled-wrong. Izone is lucky to have such a successful debut, be grateful for that and understand everyone's preferences please. P/s: I mean fuck the CLC's fans that shit talks Izone ONLY, don't fuck the whole CLC by saying they are FLOPFLOPFLOP again and again. It's not a crime to be flop, stop using it to attack them, they are miserable already.

TheInklet	I'm literally always so confused whenever I see a kpop song's comment section....
maryytao	Pretty catchy song. I’m glad they went with this song and concept not that super cutesy i concept.  I’m surprised that I actually like hitomi and sakuras voice in this song. Not bad. Nako is still a little too squeaky and cutey for me.  Nice song

Agnes Angelina	Don't hate izone it's not their fault, don't think that CLC is more famous than Iz*one,if you think that way you're totally wrong, don't think that CLC is the queen I mean if CLC sing this song maybe la vie en rose will not be as this popular right now so don't judge Iz*one don't leave a hate comment in another's girl mv I just say what I think my mind

Heliconia Lee	Sapa nama izwan sila la tekan LIKE k 😂😂😂
Asnia Hadjiyasser	New group? I like it
Wiz*somnia-L	stop mentioning CLC. If this is about their treatment and not the song then why are you here. All you heard was the demo for this song there is no evidence of them ACTUALLY preparing for this song. This way too crazy, focus on your own group this isn’t going to help them get a comeback.
YS Y	아이즈원 대단하다. 아이유, 엑소, 트와이스 컴백하는 시기에 데뷔라니? 대진운이 너무 안좋아. 그래도 이 정도 버티는 것도 대단하다. 계속 응원하고 싶다. 노래 안무 퀄리티가 요즘 나온 곡 중에 최고다.
Camille Rodriguez	Rap part. ❤

Hannah Son	I’m kinda over, I mean REALLY OVER people comparing different idol groups! Like be happy, for what you receive. I get that the other fandom is pissed at IZ*ONE but put yourself in their shoes, they just came out of a survival show they didn’t know if they were able to debut or not and here they are debuting but now there are some fans saying they prefer this band singing this song and some prefer IZ*ONE singing it. I just had enough of hearing and reading people comparing groups, like calm down please.

jimin's thic thighs .	Ain't this song supposed to be from CLC?  I guess cube sold this song coz the song producer left.💣. Btw bad timing cuz a lot of famous groups are comingback like twice etc.  Just saying tho, btw im happy at produce 48 cuz of this.

Sarah Ammara	02:50 what happend Eunbi?
Megha G	As a Cheshire and an izone fan (I don't even know everyone's name so not calling myself a wiz*one)   Yes, this was meant for CLC originally. However something fell through, we can see from the leaked clips that probably didn't finish preparing it 1) the voices aren't properly mixed 2) the dance released  is for more members than 7. That leads me to believe it was meant for CLC, but something came up and it was sold to OTR they just used CLC's vocals as a demo. Probably something to do with the producers of the song leaving cube.  To all Wiz*one's most people hating aren't actually Cheshires, they're just haters and antis. Cheshires understand that it isn't izones fault. are we upset? Sure. But most of us are not blaming izone for something they don't have control over.  To the Cheshires hating on these girls - STOP. Its not their fault that they got this song.
Bomi Jo	Loved it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
We HaVe DifFerRent CloThEs	Whats their fandom name???
eka anugrah	Stay it classy everyone just like IZ*ONE debut concept just screencap the hate and slandering, and fake rumors in this comment section also the haters account and  then report it to offtherecord.fan@gmail.com .OTR give us a chance to protect our girls

매스풀	So much better than Yes or Yes XD
Velvet's Pizzq	Even if IZONE debuted with another song they will still made another impact so whatever song they will debut they will still made it popular. Now, keep crying.
AestheticSinB	The dance kinda reminds me of (G)I-DLE a bit ( some parts )
eleanor quah	amazing song, im so so happy for these girls who've made it this far!!!!
ARIEAF	The rookie girlgroup that have much visual inside!  So, i can split them to 3 characters Sexy & Glamour : Eunbi, Chaeyeon, Minju, Hyewon Girls Crush : Sakura, Ah Yujin, Choi Yena, Woon Young Cute & Teen : Hitomi, Nako, Yuri, Chaewon  just my opinion
Oskar Sarmiento	Let’s be honest...this si a BOP because is been singing by IZ*ONE, if CLC would have sung probably the song would have been a FLOP...the composer and producer saw the possibility of becoming known and they really achieved it...good for them and IZ*ONE, LET’S SUPPORT IZ*ONE FOR THE 1ST WIN NOW!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼❤️❤️❤️
Jia Min	Who's that girl at 2:53? Holy I LOVE HER VOICE!!!!!

kokking Eung	CLC ROBBED!😭
클린한멘탈	한국팬이 보기에는 확실히 뮤비 퀄이 좀 그런듯... 춤출때는 조명이라도 좀 해서 포스를 보여줬으면 좋겠는데 컨셉도 애매하고.. 다음 뮤비를 기대해봄
Woollim Artists' Bottled Water	the fact that this song has many views, it's because many wiz*ones are streaming not just only the la vie en rose itself, so why would hate this girls when there is no one at fault. btw haters, you really just waste your time to came here just to hate on iz*one, but we also thank y'all because the views is increasing😉
Harry No	Almost 14 mil views. Let’s get to 20 mil by the end of this week. WIZ*ONE FIGHTING!!

linh nguyễn	LEE CHAEYEONNNNNNNNN CONGRATULATIONS YOU DEBUT !!!!!
Komu Hyunbin	It's funny how they're hating on iz*one for getting this song. Those 13M views for just weeks of iz*one mv are CLC's views for years or for months.
Benton	생각보다 별로네
i like memes	Do you know why eunbi debut? Is because she get everything that she wants. In the first ep she wants to be the leader and she get the position, the second one she wanted to be the center but she still get the postiton insted of yujin or chaeyeon, the 3rd one she wants to be the main vocal of rumor but she still get the position insted of chowon, the last ep she and chowon want to be the main vocal but who gets the position?? U guss it right is eunbi. So idk is it fair or not you will be the judge and does she desever to debut? Idk you deside. FYI this is just an opinion.

delapan empat	Are clc fans mad because iz*one take this song? and this song is popular? i think you are jealous because iz*one is popular, even more popular than CLC 😌😌😌😌
Adam Syahputra	I don't even understand why theese stupid peoples are getting mad with iz*one. Theese girls doesn't even fuckin know about the history of the song. The only one that they know is the song was prepared for their debut. But some fuckin haters use it to take down theese girls's. And some clc's fans are mad because they feel like they're favourite group being robbed. Wtf. If you're all gonna do protest, do that on cube, not here dummy.

Bunny Dash	THEY DID THIS!!!
3채니	CLC노래인줄 알았는데....
kkebiN	그니깐 일본인 멤버들은 별 도움이 안됨.  기존 akb48 팬덤에서 약간의 버프는 있겠지만  워낙 폐쇄적인 오타쿠형 팬덤이라 확장성에서 폭발력이 떨어짐.  어쩌면 Kpop 특유의 장점마저 잃어버리는 결과가 올 수도 있음.  차라리 한국멤버 9명만 데뷔하는 게 훨 나았을 듯.
김창한	안유진 존예
Golden Pink	I like this song. I like IZ*ONE (how to pronounce it btw?). Recently i just knew that this song was supposedly meant for CLC. Well, im a Cheshire, a bit disappointed bcs i can feel that clc will rock this song. But well, everything happened for a reason right? So lets just support both of the group. They are both talented.

yoongis puppyface	god why'd they have to choose the girls that look similar i still get yuri, yena, and chaewon mixed up. minju and hyewon. and yujin and sakura. 😭 i can tell the difference with their voices tho
Highlight YangYo	The funny thing is clc fan express their "sadness"in this mv. Go to your bias company social media or this song producer and express your "sadness" or injustice. Izone management buy it legally, end of the day.
Raewoo Park	์Now la vie en rose is izone song. This song is to the producer not CLC. why people say "izone say thank to clc" that's so joke for me.
Lamya Mohammed	Don’t get me wrong I love izone but I can’t get over the fact that this should of been Clc’s comeback song it really upsets me :( they were so excited to make this comeback too .ps yall can talk shit and say ‘it’s not cubes fault ‘but ima still be hurt since Ive been stanning clc for longer then ever

Gisela Becerra	Thank you IZ*ONE for bless us with these amazing vocals, visuals and dance. Stan talent, Stan IZ*ONE
Best Kpop, Jpop, etc-Pop Playlists	This is so great. Sorry I missed it on the K-Ville Entertainment poll I took. I definitely would have voted for this group there as well. This is a GREAT sound! Very beautiful as well!
Prinny	People being mad about cube ent here on this video are dumb. If you wanna complain go to cube ent's offical website and complain there. Go on cube ent's social media accounts and complain there. Not here on an iz*one video, they literally have nothing to do with what happened to CLC. You all already know how the kpop industry works, so take your hateful crap and go on cube ent's website or social media.
azure kous	i hope fans of the other girl group dont assume why this and that happens, there’s no confirmation yet, there are only speculations & unconfirmed hints by the fans themselves. the demo is suppose to be a guide for what the final product would sound like & the singers who sing the demos doesnt mean they are the final product because it takes a lot of process/communication from the producer to the artists/agency. The producer behind this song doesn’t only work with cube but this producer has several compositions that distributed to different artists from different agencies. tbh we don’t know what happened, who knows who but i hope some some fans of the other girl group stop with these speculations bcos it gives off unnecessary drama between two fandoms & ppl who aren’t fans of both are bandwagoning to it😑  but anyway if you’re a hater of iz*one & came here, thanks for the views i guess? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Brandi	most of these people saying clc sang it better are bandwagons trying to create drama,   us cheshires are a small fandom and we all basically stan izone. We are not bashing izone for the song we are mad at cube.  Clc prepared and spoiled us for this summer comeback that didn’t happen all we want is cube to treat clc better
Janine Kwon	COME ON GUYS WE NEED TO GIVE THEM FIRST WIN THEY DESERVED IT😍😍😍

Swagswag	No one is hating on IZONE. When people say they like the other version better, they are entitled to their own opinion. And when others say they like this version, they are entitled to their one opinion. People are only putting blame on the company. But we really don’t know what goes on behind the scenes. The saddest part is CLC worked hard, and were preparing for it. Imagine how they feel. I’m sure they were excited as it seemed like it would have been a hit for them. So for that excitement to be stepped on is messed up. Even with the choreography. What the producer did is not right. If fans want answers the right thing to do is spam CUBe.  ostensibly the producer wanted to benefit from the sales. He chose a group that was bound to succeed quickly. No one is hating on IZONE, but CLC fans are hurt. There’s this war going on though, that should stop. But y’all please focus on supporting CLC and getting them up there. They are talented. For their next comeback they will succeed! Focus on that.
Faiz Septian	LOL CLC has no right to use this song. The producer of this song just left the Cube.  So it's not wrong and it's right for the producer to sell this song again.
꼴뚜기	곡이 주인 잘찾아간듯
The Hantus	Iz*one, g-idle, gwsn, loona, fromis 9this year’s rookie is the best. Whoever won the rookie of the year is totally well deserved.

Sandra Pimentel	Llegué a este video por toda la controversia con CLC y la verdad es que yo no sé si los rumores sean ciertos ... Pero sé que estas chicas no son culpables de nada, si alguien tiene la culpa es CUBE por andar vendiendo las canciones ... De todas formas estas linduras se llevan mi apoyo y mi amor uwu IZONE ❤❤

Lonely Orbit	Hi wiz*one! Let's just enjoy the talent and ignore the haters
Loulou Plays	I feel bad and guilty that this song was supposed to be CLC's new comeback but of course CUBE just cancels it out and just focus on G(I-DLE) and BTOB to gain the money back, But of course its not I*ZONE's fault its the company, But anyway FIGHTING girls! They really do deserve their first win!! 😍🌻

Chaewon looks like Yoojung + Doyeon Weki Meki 5. Hyewon looks like Sojin Girls Day 6. Chaeyeon looks like Yoojung WJSN 7. Eunbi looks like Hyojung Oh My Girl 8. Yuri looks like Hyeri Girls Day 9. Yena looks like Arin Oh My Girl and Cheng Xiao WJSN 10. Nako looks like Boram T-Ara Meanwhile, for Yujin and Hitomi, I don't have any idea since their faces are unique for me. Do you have another opinion?

I am lonely 😞	Watching them just makes me feel like a proud parent. The amount of abuse they have received this year is so unfair and so wrong. All those fake rumours, political controversies, racial abuse, body shamming, death threats, abusive comments, boycotts and many more were the doings of their haters who just wanted them to fail. But now they are proving everyone wrong. They have gone through a lot of hardships this year and it just makes us fans so happy to see them smile. I can’t wait for these girls to show their talent and charms to everyone. Us IZ*ONE fans will always be by their side and we will always be proud of them ❤️💜❤️

Stop being an immature bitch please. Bye.

Alexaa deem	CLC:(
Sam K	I’m not a hater but I heard clc demo of this song and I think it better there vocals suited this song more than iz*one
morerevel	I'm getting really annoyed by all these false comments. *CUBE DID NOT SELL THE SONG TO MNET.* The producer of this song left cube. Of course he had to sell and give it to a company, which happened to be stone music/mnet and so Iz*one debuted with this song. I hate to say this but some CLC fans are saying that they hate cube not iz*one but they're like all over the place saying "CLC WAS ROBBED." "CLC'S VERSION IS FAR BETTER" wtf? If you all are hurt by this issue, go complain to cube not in the commment section of IZ*ONE'S MV because izone clearly has nothing to do with this issue. If y'all ever think that CLC's version is better, well IZ*ONE GAVE JUSTICE TO THE SONG. They did well! I heard both versions, both are great! So stop all these draaaammmaaaaas. Okay bye.

Tofu Mochi	Yall CLC stans are so petty.. first I see comments saying " CLC are better than Twice " on Pepe, then I see " CLC is better than G IDLE " on Black Dress now this🙃🙃🙃  The song wouldn't even be successful if CLC released it. This is a good song, but it's only successful thanks to Izone. It's bc Izone has been hyped for so long. If it was a CLC song, the same annoying stans would say " stop sleeping on CLC " and that's it. CLC still would be the worst selling GG of 2018. This year CLC were last on physical sales with 4K. You KNOW album sales are what matter the most and not YT views. Instead of streaming, *BUY ALBUMS* And get out of here Izone deserves to be successful. You guys are giving a bad image to CLC. STOP

my _	Yena is really talented. Despite being a vocal member and having no experience at rapping she still did her part really good. Dancing as always perfect. My bias is such a queen. Love her 💕💕
Beka K	Bunch of people in here acting like they care about CLC. Where were you with Black Dress? Where were you with Hobgoblin? I know for a fact this isn't all CLC's fans but just people suddenly needing to jump to their defense because they don't like IZ*ONE. I love CLC and I'm waiting for their big break and maybe if yall would have cared about them before this, it would have happened.

Anna Hernandes	i watched all the pd48 since the 1st episode, so proud of they
ulo challa	well... its great but the vocals :c
ToriCat	clc should've gotten this :(((
ND Gee	Now I know why CLC hasn't gotten that much attention from korean public. Because even their fans are trying to climb mountains just to bring other groups down not knowing that they are just wasting their time and energy. Lol.
i don't stan groups with annoying fandoms	Hey y'all, I'm a Cheshire and a wiz*one and I'd like to apologize for the immature fan's behavior. I personally love both versions of the song, but I'm really glad IZ*one got it as their debut ❤️❣️💞💗💖 I think is cheshires are just upset bc of how CLC is being treated by cube 😕 our girls work their butts off, and are like the forgotten of cube. Please support CLC as well as IZ*one! 😞😔💕❣️❤️

The Jibooty	CLC wants their song back  🙃
스톰윈드	CLC 외퀴...아니 외국인 팬들은 뭔가 착각하는게 있네 ㅋㅋ 냉정하게 얘기하자면  CLC 한테 라비앙로즈 노래 갔으면 진짜 쥐도새도 모르게 묻혔다.  대표적인 CLC 명곡이 블랙드레스인데 국내에서는 팬덤이 한줌단이니까  묻혀 버렸잖어 안그래? 라비앙로즈 작사, 작곡가 입장에서는 다행인일이지.  거기다가 큐브도 반응 좋은 걸그룹 아이들한테 집중하는건 사실이잖어.
Kpopper Panda	OK I have a question. Is their group name pronounced as I ZONE or as Is one (IZ ONE) cause their is a space(IZ*ONE). Pls someone tell me so I don't have to keep saying it wrong hahaha
Clementine Schuurman	I love them so much. I feel proud to have voted for Yena as she doesn't disappoint!
Luyi Melo	Hi, CLC fans, I know it's hard to cope with the fact that your group has not comeback for a long time but could you stop blaming IZ * ONE and (G) I-dle for that ??? Isn't fault of the groups that CLC have no comeback, go blame CUBE!  Alô CLC fãs, eu sei que é difícil lidar com o fato de que o grupo de vocês não tem comeback a muito tempo, mas poderia parar de culpar IZ*ONE e (G)I-dle por isso??? Não é culpa dos grupos que elas não tem comeback, vão apedrejar a CUBE!

Exhalting	I came here for Louis Armstrong but got this instead and I can’t lie I’m a bit disappointed
hyewon visual bomb	All of you need to relax, CLC didn't owned the song, it was the producers and CUBE... Maybe MNET/STONE offered more money for the credits of the songs... Or maybe CUBE needed the money to give Cube artists decent comebacks. This is not IZ*ONE's fault.
C a m i l l e Rose	The song is fine, but the concept on four walls I don't like. I would have preferred that the director had a better vision to make the video, in terms of atmosphere, wardrobe and type of camera. It would have been more beautiful.
random human being	ROOKIE OF THE YEAR!!!!
Carol	First time hearing their version after CLC’s version was leaked, and I actually really like the song!!Seunghee and Sorn’s vocals during the chorus definitely have more power, but the girls here did a really amazing job. Thank god I actually gave this group/song a chance cause its a damn bop
Tae kook	The best famous IZ*ONE predebut vs now of year's 2018. This smile lookin IZONE stunning cool is success will still  in korean 💕' IZONE almost cries be strong during concert turn back show true.

Marlyn Merioles	Hello? Newbie here.
x daisy x	i should see CLC performing this-
뚱이	이거 초반 도입부 트와이스랑 비슷한 노래 뭐였지
Citlalli Juarez	Las nuevas tuais :v
AB Mashups	the verse reminds me of TWICE the pre-chorus reminds me of BLACKPINK the chorus reminds me of Red Velvet the rap reminds me of (G)-IDLE the bridge reminds me all of them together
EternityKX	Usually I don't like girl kpop bands but I love this song!! <3 Only wish the choreography was better, has so much potential, if it was a boy band then dancing would have epic, shame that girl kpop bands have to always dance like that... :(
dennis antioquia	Can anyone explane 2 me if they get money?? Like salary?? Every month? And how much
Skzen :3	these girls are amazing seriously, I love them <3

Jennie Queen	🚨SAKURAAAAAAA VISUAL,  DANCER,  VOCAL,  pretty😍 BIAS❤🚨
Hasle Kun	I'm Wiz*one, and also chessire, but i don't think that it's ok to talk about CLC and attack cube in Izone's MV, it's like  if we start talking about Izone in CLC's mv. Both groups are good, so if anyone is mad about that this song isn't from CLC, attack cube, don't bring down Izone.
DheL Ling	KIM MINJOO is indeed from an agency that doesn't have an idol grub..but MINJOO has proven that he can become an idol like the others.he has tried very hard.he's great.i'm proud of MINJOO.I like you 😍💪🧡🧡🧡
Naty K-POP	This song is trend in my country 😁💕💕💕

rebel ng	Elle sont beaucoup trop c’est dommage sa gâche tout
M F	mais um kgrupo enorme com várias inúteis e apenas alguns vocais. Por isso kpop e tão zoado. pra quem um grupo desse tamanho? tá na hora do kpop focar em idols apenas com talento vocal.
Lucas Smaldone	Justice for CLC
Haphap Kecap	If you want to complain, then find a better way and better place  Sent e-mail or petition to ur fave's agency, and stop spamming in this place  From what I see, yall just tried to make use of IZONE's popularity to make other people recognize ur fave group
Nugroho Yunanto	0:46 look like red velvet's irene

Samanta Stepka	Am I the only one who doesn't understand the hype around these girls? I don't even know. I tried to listen to it but got bored of it so I stopped. How many members are there though?
Febha Hageng	For WIZ*ONE, stop mentioning certain group in the comment section and just report them if you find some people being salty or commenting about certain group

Irdina Izzati	Who's your bias?  Me ofc = ahn yujin lover
petalsofdesire	Why are there so many members?
discotiq	Instant k-pop classic
Miso Franco	"If the CLC had released the song it would not have been successful" but people, do you guys like a song or group just because they are famous ?? there are good groups that do not have the proper recognition and famous groups that are not so good. So I want to take advantage of this mini controversy to ask you to open your eyes to the small groups that launch comeback, to support them if you like, I am not only talking about CLC, but also of several other wonderful groups with wonderful repertoires but unfortunately not much visibility because they do not have a big name. ❤
hasan imtiaz Labib	It would be great if it got over 100 million views 😍☺ .I become a big fan of them.How can their debut song be so good?They nailed it.😂😂
생혬	I'm so angry about how Japanese fans are reacting to Iz*one. Most of them are telling that iz*one is AKB48's 'derived'group. Hey stupid Japanese, the fact is there are only 3 members in this group and the rest of them are Korean. Ok? Don't you dare to compare iz*one to AKB48😡😠 If you're so big fan about AKB48, then listen to No way man(AKB48's new song) if you are a human, you can realize how much la vie en rose is better than that. Haven't you guys think about why all the Japanese in produce 48 wanted to debut in Korea? Because they experienced how much the life in Japan as an idol is tough. They have to compete with over 100 people in one group. They have to shake hands with foolish fans who don't even listen to their songs and just buy their album because they  want to shake hands. Sakura, Nako and Hitomi is bullied by Japanese fans on internet because they announced they will rest their idol activities in Japan while they are in iz*one. I don't care how Japanese likes AKB48, but don't u dare to compare akb48 and iz*one. Every Korean iz*one fans are angry since you guys said iz*one is derived group of akb48. Stop saying that plz *[Currently Sakura, Nako and Hitomi are in iz*one not akb48, so stop bullying them and stop saying they are betrayers of Japanese ]
TrinityFaith Hoyle	STAN IZ*ONE
Kpop is my Lifeuuu	Wow... I love it.
Franciele Beatriz	BABYYYYYYYYYYY'S💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Lucy Smart	I can imagine how good CLC’s comeback with la vie en rose would be but however much of a huge shame it is that the song was (probably) given away I really think that IZ*ONE pulled this off maybe equally as well as CLC would have. I’m just triggered because cube said CLC would have a comeback but they still haven’t
Terrrie Nana	IZONE IS THE BEST 😍😍 LETS STREAM THIS MV UNTIL IT REACH 10M 🔥
Arthy Suresh	Eunbi deadass looks like Somi and Irene had a child
Thrices can eat shit and leave the kpop community •	8 trending in the US❤️❤️

Mxlle tichabine97	ohh i like
anna rizkia	Kemarin kemarin cuma ada komen positif aja di sini, kenapa sekarang jadi buat ajang promosi dengan nyebut nyebut nama group lain sama komplain nggak guna ya. Lagunya terkenal karna iz*one bekerja keras dan promosi yang baik dari OTR, tolong respect jangan mencemari dengan komen komen yang nggak tepat sasaran.
*짐잉군	와 역시 권은비 진짜 잘한다👍
Laaddj Hahahay	omg stupid clc fans is here too
Blink B	Honda Hitomi, Kwon Eunbi, Lee Chaeyeon. ❤️   Don’t mind me just listing the members that gave me heart attacks 😂😂 now let’s see who my bias will be.
Regine Osorio	This song, very catchy..
Code X	No point crying over spilt milk the producers that made this song have left cube, which means they are free to choose who they want to sell the song too!  It is a shame for CLC but if you believe in your girls believe that they will be stronger and release another BOP! believe in them rather than crying over spilt milk.  Also Iz*One version did it justice aswell it was AMAZING and I hope CLC fans dont start fanwar as this is a common occurance in the industry where producers need to make money! Iz*one is hot right now and thats facts.  I dont think clc would have made it as popular and sold as much, but still just believe in your girls to release something that surpasses their limits and release a super selling bop!
Kpop Trash	THEY LOOKED HELLA GOOD IN RED~ QUEENS~👑❤️🔥
hee junhoe	Let 80M ☑️ ❗
stan clc	To all the izone’s fans we were never blaming izone for that. It’s obviously not their fault. Sorry if you’re offended. But we’re just disappointed with this situation. I see many izone’s fans talk shit about CLC. Why would you do that, they’re not even izone’s rivals. Do you like when someone insults Izone?  Please don’t hate CLC because they don’t deserve it💔  To all the fellow Cheshires, please be mature 🙏🏽 Remember that your mean words can affect CLC
gowon loona	*JUSTICE FOR CLC*

Eoqow Tunieoq	Oh? Worm? The song is good? I'll be honest here I don't like izone The lineup man since it's their mv I won't go into a detailed discussion But THIS song Japanese line snapped ok they caught my attention. Normally I don't rlly love cute voices but j line's vocals worked beautifully with this song I love how instead of cutesy the song turned out refreshing, hopeful and even powerful in that aspect And the dance Chaeyon man she snapped I love how the dance goes with the lyrics. Those kind of chores are my favorites.  Which brings me to my point I'm annoyed I don't want to stan this group but I'm impressed by j line, eunbi n chaeyeon. The song blew me away

Super Broccoli	are they permanent or will disband after 1 year? im sorry if the question sounds stupid i never watched produce but i know izone is from produce and i think its so that produce groups disband after 1 year (i.o.i&wanna one but they extend contract on wanna one) so will iz*one disband after 1 year???
黃明義	I hope they can get 1st before Twice and EXO coming... > < Fighting!!

Choi Duck	YENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
CRYSTAL CLEAR CHESHIRE	Yes we get it CLC are flops, it’s not even an insult at this point. What pisses me off is that if this song stayed with CLC it could’ve been their big break they needed. IZONE could literally sing the most shit song and it would’ve charted in Korea(no offense, it’s the truth tho)...whatever at least IZONE does it justice though not as much as CLC would’ve imo. I’m not blaming IZONE for this btw, just blaming whoever thought it was a good idea to sell it to them...

angelica choi	im upset because some people here keep on comparing the version of clc and izone. I know you are all upset rn but please stop flooding comments about clc here. This is IZONE's video and besides its not izone's fault if they got that song. you should throw your hate to cube's yt account not here. Thank you for your kind consideration.

sandy fitri	I suggested this song to my friends who are working in the call center industry, these type of people are those casual listeners, they dont like kpop in general, but most of them really loved this, some even looked this up on Spotify. this is how you impress non kpop fans. the song itself is interesting and mesmerizing. plus the contemporary beat and melody makes it really unique.
AiJie111	I LOVE IZ*ONE I LOVE WonYoung

Nat Chen	Still sad that CUBE decided to give this song to IZONE instead of CLC. They already recorded the song, choreographed the dance and everything is ready for a comeback. They even already teased us with some photos of the members holding roses. Everything is set and in the end they postpone CLC's comeback and give this song to IZONE (which is likely because they are currently more popular than CLC). Just imagine what CLC members must have felt. They have everything set and... sigh... CUBE is getting worse and worse. I'm not blaming IZONE tho I know they have no say in this. I'm blaming CUBE. I just hope they won't ruin G-Idle's and Pentagon's career too with their selfishness.  P.S. If some of you guys wanna see, there's already some videos of CLC's version of this song posted in youtube. Also their dance practice video. I won't say who is better because I don't wanna create fanwars. Both of the group has their own colours. CLC is more powerful and IZONE is more feminine and cute. Both are nice.

Ginnell Armstead	Hmmm...I’m 30 years old and most of the groups I’ve listened to in my early 20s have disbanded or on an extended hiatus (Wonder Girls, 2PM, F(x), etc....)which has caused me to kind of not be into k pop much anymore other than Red Velvet because the new generation groups don’t appeal to me...but I must say...these girls may have sucked me back in. Lol. I love it!
kd4wg01	I'm just wondering how they split singing parts between 12 girls. But I guess they made it work. Looks fun to be with that many ladies . Good job :)

OK EY.	*We cheshires do not hate izone, understand us. cube on the side left to clc by a rookie group "inactive" where he has promoted much better than a clc in 3 years. clc gave this song to izone, they have been planning their return for 8 months, but cube extends that term. this song was not planned to be a title song for clc, they are the strongest concept. maybe it was planned to be inside a mini-album.*  cheshire does not hate izone, cheshire hates cube  stan IZ*ONE, stan CLC.

missshyaz	Im a chesire and I hate cube not izone. Please dont hate on clc or us. Im just unhappy that this was suppose to be clc's cb song. Not because of the song bt we chesires(not the fake annoying ones) have been waiting for their comeback for so long. Clc have been giving spoilers to their cb song wic was suppose to be this song and they were excited to share it as well. (eg. Selfies of them holding roses, they said that they gonna comeback in june or july *bt didnt happen, taking videos with filters of flower petals). So I was pretty upset that their cb was delayed cz of this and had to wait again. If this is how I feel, what more than what the clc members must be feeling cz they too were excited about it. Anyway, all the best to izone and congrats to their debut. No hate or anything. Maybe its good if they have this song and hopefully clc cb with a good song as well. Peace!

Suga, Kookies and Tae	This year has been a great year for kpop girl groups. G-IDLE debuted and we're extremely successful,  and then LOONA debuted too and finally I*ZONE! this is the first time I've heard of these girls, and when I heard this song I was like oml this can't b a comeback! And then I started researching into them more and I saw that they were already breaking records and I'm honestly so impressed at all the talent that's been shown by I*ZONE and all the other new gg. Definitely stanning!  Woman power!

Diễm Lê	Cày view đi mn ơi
Sogazu	How freaking good this song is makes me kind of angry. Remember that god forsaken abomination of a debut song ‘Dream Girl’? I.O.I deserved so much better, they deserved something like this. Instead, some big shot d-bag in the industry gave the job to his son to build his career or some bs like that. Therefore, Dream Girl. Made you Jesus Facepalm and still makes you do that.
몡슐ヲ	Very cute👍 good sing izone very good singer^^~
KOKODROP	From all PD debuts, this group have the best song from all, is a bOP, AND it doesn't even look like a debut, not like WANNA ONE or I.O.I (no hate, just a opinion) this seems like a comeback, a successful one, it has amazing vocals and choreography, and is very bubbly.
Liesha Kurnia	Quick question, does streaming on itunes and spotify helps the girls too like streaming it here or nah?
Vto Media	개성 강한 친구를 열두 명 모아놓으면 시선이 분산되는 느낌이 들법도 한데 프로야구 올스타전을 보는 듯한 느낌이 든다. 1번부터 9번까지 타순을 잘 짜놓은 느낌!

Oli Veuh	It doesn’t feel like Sakura is the second choice of Izone we can’t even see her. I just feel like this group is 100% Korean and we don’t feel the concept of a mix group they don’t show that much japanese member. A waste of talent... i feel sorry for her even if they have debuted

And she is really cute in izone chu, hopefully even more people can recognize her!!! izone fighting! the whole group is amazing<3

Sebahat G.	They look like they know what they are doing and having good time. They look confident tho. Starting melody is nice to hear. Vocals sound okay. Some are impressive, some are ordinary. I gotta check the full dance choreography.  Fresh and new even though there is still some cliche of being a kpop girl group. Well, welcome to the stage !
BangtanSugaKookies	I can't stop listening to this. It's just *that* good. Whoever composed this song did a brilliant job.
Maricris Mabingnay	I swear this group. They are just TOO PEEEEERFECT. Sadly, they are just a temporary group. Imagine if they are not. Every member has their own unique talent, aura, and beauty. It's hard not to notice all of them.

Asian Queen	Hyewon sang only 4 seconds in the whole MV😐 Yena did a great job & I’m proud of her❤️ I’m actually curious to know if Hyewon’s position in IZONE is backup dancer??... She debuted as rapper but if she didnot rap it’s okay maybe she didnot want to, but giving her only 4 second to just open her mouth, specially in Debut MV which people will recognize members by their lines.. Producer disappointed me overall
Its kpop	Why it keeps repeating this mv in my advertisment 🤔🤔

Joyce Beltran_21	i love it
Miraculous Two	Tbh if this was sang by an another g group they would be underrated AF good thing they came from the PD48 wich is the reason why they are famous no matter what song they release the thought that they are from PD48 people will stan , its a good song tho, i just feel bad for other group that deserve more recognition :( EDIT okay, tbh i was thinking about CLC my fave group and the first group that made me into kpop while typing this, and guess what? IT IS THEIR FUCKING SONG, wow.... they have really good tracks but people are sleeping on them, now another group have to sing their song to make this popular lolololol, i wonder if CLC did emded up singing this song , im pretty sure people will call it flop , well i agree, this song also is not that my taste, but this proves that people stan base on the background of the groups, so sad....
capulet	I’m so pleasantly surprised by this comeback! The song gets better and better each time I hear it ❤️❤️

TT Rookie	For ppl who keep saying the japanese members are lacking of skills. But u forgot. Sakura is visual, hitomi is dancer and nako is vocal. Each of them have their roles. No one is perfect and none of us are perfect too. So stop complaining. I believe some people who speaks in here dont even dare to attempt a survival show.   Im supporting all of them for their courage. I really like Yuri because of her vocal and i realized she is a dorky member.

KPOP Fanboy bangtwice	This song is amazing 💕 Wonyoung is officially my bias in this group 💘
PewPew	I was expecting a super innocent concept, something I'm not a fan of, so I'm pleasantly surprised by this. It's both fierce and feminine, reflecting the variety in personalities and auras of the girls nicely. That, and the song just sounds really good. Adding it to my Spotify playlist for sure!   Side notes: - I like Yena's singing voice, but damn, her rapping is fire. Wasn't expecting that! - In terms of vocals, Yuri is definitely the backbone of this group. Besides having a strong voice in general, she stands out with her tone.  - Chaeyeon's English is good! It was short, but I didn't detect an accent in that "I don't wanna make it blue" line - Wish they would've given Nako at least one good high note. Other than that, I have no real complaints about line distribution.

kenza charfaoui	I love the song it sounds really really good but I really think they did the japanese members dirty especially sakura, she got second yall she should have more exposure. No need to talk about Nako who had one of the best vocals in the show and ended up getting two lines, poor Hitomi she is such a good dancer they could have given her more. This is just my point of view so don't get offended. And for those saying it's normal for sakura since she can't sing, I think she is doing just fine and that if THEY WANTED to they could have given her a lot more parts. Anyways they are doing good and that is the most important let's go for it 💪

She doesn't look cute and young (child-like) here and that's new. 1:45 What a beautiful and cute maiden we have here who is dressed in maid-cos. 1:49 This lyrics is made for Sakura. 1:50 looking so beautiful and editorial here Saku--chan! 2:28 Idk but Wonyoung looks strange here. 2:30 She's so pretty here on the other hand. 2:34 Great vocals we have here, Yuri! 3:21 So cute Nako-chan! 3:29 Uhmm...Sakura? What happened? Lol I just wished the ending couldve been not so fast like that. It feels like it was rushed.

Curia Gameplay	Can we make this video 100M Views very soon? Can we give this to them as a gift? Especially for Chaeyeon who had to be on three survival shows before she made a debut, for Eunbi who had to be a trainee for so long before debut, for Jo Yuri who has an outstanding and stable vocal that didn't get the chance to debut on idol school, for Hitomi who have low ranking on every senbatsu, and for Sakura who always worked so hard in every senbatsu to ranked 1 but never got the chance. Let's make them realize that there's a perfect timing for everything and this is their right time to become a member of global girl group. And this my friend showed us that we should never give up on our dreams and continue to work hard. They may be a temporary group but let's give them the best 2.5 years of their life.   Edit: (another info from minamyoui) Yena also tried to debut for her brother that debuted 2 times but their group didnt succeed. And for nako who had a bad start in hkt48, no ome came to her handshake, haters got mad at her for being in the senbatsu.
Annamarie Valencia	I think this new girl group will be successful even just a project group

Xen	Ecclesiasticus 25:33 From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.   Ecclesiasticus 42:12-13 Behold not everybody’s beauty: and tarry not among women. For from garments cometh a moth, and from a woman the iniquity of a man.   Ecclesiasticus 9:4-5 Use not much the company of her that is a dancer, and hearken not to her, lest thou perish by the force of her charms. Gaze not upon a maiden, lest her beauty be a stumblingblock to thee.   Ecclesiasticus 9:8-10 Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up, and gaze not about upon another’s beauty. For many have perished by the beauty of a woman, and hereby lust is enkindled as a fire. Every woman that is a harlot, shall be trodden upon as dung in the way

Just About Me	Hmmm... Nice Song ! So Cheerful 🎆😄
I N V E ’	For people who are confused bcz of the line distribution I'll make it clear for y'all + this is official : MAIN VOCALS : Jo Yuri / Kwon Eunbi LEAD VOCALS : Kim Chaewon / Lee Chaeyeon / Yabuki Nako / Ahn Yujin / Choi Yena SUB VOCALS : Miyawaki Sakura / Jang Wonyoung / Honda Hitomi / Kim Minjo / Kang Hyewon  MAIN RAPPER : Choi Yena (yes guys that's official 😎) LEAD RAPPER : Kang Hyewon (Yesss giirrl slay ittt) SUB RAPPERS : Lee Chaeyeon / Kim Minjo MAIN DANCER : (that's obvious LOL) Lee Chaeyeon  LEAD DANCERS : Choi Yena / Kwon Eunbi / Ahn Yujin / Jang Wonyoung / Honda Hitomi  VISUAL LINE HAHA : Miyawaki Sakura / Jang Wonyoung / Kim Minjo / Kang Hyewon  LEADER : Kwon Eunbi  PS : Yabuki Nako didn't get a lot of lines bcz of her voice. It doesn't really suit the song + she is not really fluent in Korean u know Honda Hitomi got enough lines for her position I mean she is a sub VOC so yeah + her voice actually doesn't suit the song  Miyawaki Sakura got to shine more than hiichan and Nako bcz guys plz she ranked 2nd and they kept on putting her on back at least they had to give her those "LA vie end rose" lines.  And yeah that's all plz support my babies they worked hard.

Reveluv 99	I love every part of this song, except for the chorus. I mean, they should have at least put some efforts cause the pre-chorus is already good.  I get that they wanna make it catchy and simple, or they just wanna make it sounded quite laid back than the pre chorus. But i always think a catchy but *sing along chorus* is better than depending on some catchy words and the instrumental in a song. this really feels empty and nothing special.

once sim	우선, 냉정하게 평가하면, 뮤비 너무 단순함. 급하게 찍은듯. 장원영의 센터는 그냥 일반 그룹의 한명의 퍼포먼스 느낌. 포스가 없음. 음악은 그럭저럭임.  트와이스의  우아하게..  데뷔곡이랑 비교하면.. 차이가 많음.  준비 기간이 짧은거 같은느낌이강함. 그리고 트와이스랑 비슷한건  공감대비 비공 비율이  비슷함~  센터무게감은 진짜 떨어지는듯. 장원영을 그냥  귀여운 막내라인으로 밀어줬으면 더 좋았을듯 .

GaegolMaster	놀랍네.. 첫 데뷔곡은 가사 내용보단 반복 구절로 중독성과 흥얼거림을 중시한 의미 불명의 노래를 쓸 줄 알았는데.. 정통파 KPOP으로 스타트를 하네. 단발성이 아니라. 장기적으로 그룹을 키워 가려는거 같네..   방송 후폭풍 노려 빠르게 본전 뽑으려는게 아닌거 같아 다행이네.. 다들 고생했슴. 결실을 거둘때임.

Like with IOI, they were doing so well until they disbanded and then from then most of the members got forgotten about? I honestly think its a bit of a waste and I hope that in the future, project groups like this stay together like normal groups, anyways neverland and army here supporting - and soon to be and wizone?? if thats the name, supporting, hope these talented girls do well

GIdle Mamamoo Blackpink Are The Best	Chaeyeon is so strong in this. She gives off a strong presence. I'm glad. And does Hitomi sing?
Micah Kashiwabara	To be honest, after the announcement of the winners, I’m one of those who said the line up isn’t good. One of the reason is that some of the girls I like didn’t have the chance to win. But watching this mv makes me think that I was wrong. These girls look good together. If someone lacks of something, another member could fill it up. They match so well. Lesson learned, wait first until you see what they really got when they debut. We just won’t know if they could do it when they’re not starting yet. I’m hoping for the best for them. I’m wishing for their success. FIGHTING! ❤️

Yiwei Hu	I like this group a lot..  Wonyoung is such a cute giant baby, Sakura has such an captivating aura Yuri's voice is so distinctive, unique and soothing Eunbi is soo charming  and her voice is very powerful Yujin is so  fresh (? dont know how to put it in words) Chaeyeon is such a good and powerfull dancer Minjoo's beauty is unreal and you can see that she's getting more and more confident. Yena's voice is kinda husky and soo nice ~_~ Hitomi is too cute (especially her cheeks) Nako is  soo smol and cute, but  Chaewon's voice is very chique'ish in my opinion Hyewon's soft'ish rapping is very nice and she improved alot!

_술	모든 멤버 다 좋아하고 최애도 따로 있지만 유리 파트가 많은데도 불구하고 확 살지 않아서 아쉬운 느낌 오히려 리드보컬 은비가 보컬적 역량을 보여줄 수 있는 부분을 다 가져가버림 메보 파트는 당연히 제일 많아야겠지만 많은 것만이 다가 아니라 메보가 확 끌고 간다는 느낌이 있어야함 근데 그걸 리드보컬한테 다 줘버리니까 누가 메보인지 혼란스러울 정도,, 파트 분배는 분량적으로는 잘된 편이지만 모든 잘된 그룹은 메보와 메인댄서의 역할이 분명함 그 그룹의 메보는 누구? 하면 바로 나올 정도로ㅇㅇ 유리파트만 돋보이게 해라 이게 아니라 난 심지어 유리가 최애가 아닌데도 아이즈원이 잘되려면 각자 맡고 있는 분야에서 정체성이 확고해야 된다고 봄ㅠㅠ 킬링파트를 유리가 해야된다는게 아니라 적어도 힘있게 치고 나오는건 메보가 하는게 맞음 사람들한테 각인되기에 거기 아이즈원 메보 잘하더라 이런게 나와야 된다는거,, 메보가 따로 있는데도 그 그룹의 보컬 하면 다른 애가 먼저 떠오르면 안된단거지 유리 파트 뭐였지? 싶을 정도로 은비 파트만 기억에 남음 메인댄서 채연이는 역할을 너무 잘해주고 있고 유리는 기회만 되면 바로 보여줄 멤버인데 이번 곡은 메보 파트가 좀 그렇긴 하다ㅠㅠ

Taeyeon rose송치아	#2ontrending  on you tube..wow..I am proud of them..I will never forget this moment...They are now one of my favourite girl groups...I really love this song...it is so so good..The best...#WIZONE
It's me Titi	The first girl is iconic
Cats Meow	Sorry... the song is good, but when you put another language in your song, be sure to say it correctly... the prononciation is horrible. I don’t blame the singers but the producer who don’t make any research about french.

Phattarawadee Srisawang	💜💛💙💚💖💕💗💔
리 세	아이즈원 솔직히 멤버들은 다 좋은데 뮤비가 스토리 위주로 안나오고 춤만 많이 나오네요 .. 그리고  제 개인적인 생각인데 아이즈원 멤버들 대부분이 청순함, 섹시함 보다는 귀여움,깜찍함 이런게 더 잘어울리네요.. 왜 이게 타이틀곡이된건지 ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

hanney x	Sakura where are you? 😌🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
reveluv carat	Miyawaki Sakura I love you
It's Deen	Song analysis IMO, not the visual(of course they're all pretty) Intro: the synths,the plucking instrument sounds refreshing. good Verse:( Wyoung until Hyewon) not bad, some of them dont suit the song. Pre-Chorus : SLAYS! Eunbi's mature voice with the powerful dance (as Chaeyeon also) and Yuri's high notes deliver the energy. make it the best part of the song. Chorus : duh.thought it will be more powerful, music thins out, feels like going back to intro. Rap : Good one. Yena is so unpredictable :0 the same goes to second verse till outro.
Derek Lo	LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG! Anyone get CLC's Black Dress vibe from this song? lol Especially the drop and the last part?
Yumiko1316 Taehyungie	Wow!!  No.1 In the Philippines!!  Well cant argue with that... just like when bboom bboom became a trending in the Philippines...   Not to hate but...  They debuted in the wrong timing... Their ganna face a lot of huge kpop idols who's ganna have a comeback at the end of the year...  TWICE, EXO AND WANNA ONE...  Not hate... just saying... I really love this Song💗💗 (But not as much as BTS song's😁)

오모리김치찌개	라비앙로즈는 후렴구 빼고 별로 재미없는 노래인듯. 그리고 kick 무료쓰셧나 진짜 싸구려티남 그나마 deep trap같은 느낌이라 괜찮긴한데 후렴전에 나오는 비트 진짜 구림 조유리가 보컬로 그나마 인공호흡해서 살려낸 느낌정도?

Duane C	A good MV, it has a little of the Japanese energy,with the Korean style.  Would like to see just the dance version.   Would also be great if they did a mostly Japanese high energy dance song.

Mira Cotierre	"La vie en rose" literally translates to "Life in PINK". However, it would be better translated to life through rosy (pink) glasses. The idea is to depict a state where everything appears rosy and cheerful to you. It's about a state of bliss when everything around you is a source of joy.  So rose here.... Is taken as a LITERAL rose and... In RED... Okay. See for yourself: "Like deep red water, this time I’ll make it red eh eh eh Make it red eh eh eh One day, my heart red like a rose Ooh ah eh eh eh newly oh oh Rose  This feeling more than a ruby (more than a ruby) Like the sparkle that I feel  This pulling pull Na na now Right now Na na now I don’t wanna make it blue Imagine it La Vie en Rose  The light inside The more deeper eyes Sets my heart on fire Makes me dance Oh, don’t forget it This Rose standing here Oh so that she can shine all the time  La La La La Vie en Rose (Ooh) This is my my La La La La Vie en Rose (Rose) (Ooh) Oh It’s my my La La La La Vie en Rose  You can expect it (This perfect feeling for some reason) I like it even closer (Red) The bright eyes like a ruby, everyone looks All eyes on me I shine more than anyone else I’ll stain into red  This feeling more like candy (More like candy) My feeling sweet-like  This pulling pull Na na now Right now Na na now I don’t wanna make it blue Imagine it La Vie en Rose  The light inside The more deeper eyes Sets my heart on fire Makes me dance Oh, don’t forget it This Rose standing here Oh so that she can shine all the time  La La La La Vie en Rose (Ooh) This is my my La La La La Vie en Rose (Rose) (Ooh) Oh It’s my my La La La La Vie en Rose  Open your eyes Everything has changed Look at this world no one knows about Oh baby La La La La La La La Vie en Rose Everything stained red La La La La La La La Vie en Rose  It’s okay if it’s a dream Paint it red I will call you so you can always wake up Oh, don’t forget it This Rose standing here Oh so that she can shine all the time  La La La La Vie en Rose (Ooh) This is my my La La La La Vie en Rose (Ooh) I’ll stain it in the rose La La La La Vie en Rose  New washable My Rose So it’s bright My Rose La La La La Vie en Rose So this feeling’s special (We’ll make it red) Oh it’s my my La La La La Vie en Rose"  Please don't use a famous French phrase, (which is also the title of my favorite French song, you'll forever be adored, Ms. Edith) and misinterpret what it actually means... What is up with appropriating French culture these days as a trend?! Sorry... I'm just mad. IT'S TIME TO STAAAAHHHP 😂😬  PS. I mean I guess, they've kind of got some of the interpretation of the phrase right with the feelings conveyed in certain lyrics, but still... Not a fan. So yeah... Ahahahaha don't mind me, Kpop fans....

Orlan Rei	I hated on Minju in the past cause I believed she was undeserving and awkward in general. But she proved me wrong here and also in the live performance. My bias now. Wow how did she change so much. But Hyewon... idk

Ann Yong	Des yeux qui font baisser les miens Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche Voilà le portrait sans retouches De l'homme auquel j'appartiens Quand il me prend dans ses bras Il me parle tout bas Je vois la vie en rose Il me dit des mots d'amour Des mots de tous les jours Et ça me fait quelque chose Il est entré dans mon cœur Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie Et dès que je l'aperçois Alors je sens en moi Mon cœur qui bat Des nuits d'amour à plus finir  Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place Des ennuis, des chagrins s'effacent Heureux, heureux à en mourir Quand il me prend dans ses bras Il me parle tout bas Je vois la vie en rose Il me dit des mots d'amour Des mots de tous les jours Et ça me fait quelque chose Il est entré dans mon cœur Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause C'est toi pour moi, moi pour toi dans la vie Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie Et dès que je t'aperçois Alors je sens dans moi Mon cœur qui bat La la, la la, la la La la, la la, ah la La la la la

AK musician	I dont know why some korean netizen critized the japanese member just because the conflict between korea - japan back then. It's not related at all, they weren't born yet at that time. but they're really good, they deserve to debut in this group and i wish they really be a part of k-girlgroup. Especially nako omg she's really cute🤗
olivia.ea	this song is so addicting, the concept is well executed too, it seems to suit all the members nicely
Ryu Lurk	i think they are cute and kinda cool because the steps that they use is amazing and not too girly like the other groups

방구석	노래가 매력이 없어요. 밋밋해. 기존 그룹에비해 실력으로 밀리는 상황에서 경연프로 버프받을때 좋은 곡으로 확 치고 나가지 않으면 힘들텐데..재미있는 안무도 없고 노래는 심심하고.. 수록곡 수준밖에 안되는 곡을 메인으로 하다니..  위기감을 갖고 비싸게라도 좋은곡 사서 빨리 싱글이라도 내라.. 이제 곧 버프 끝난다.

Carat's Noona	Since yesterday, this song keeps on repeating on my playlist. I really love Eunbi ,Yena,  Minju and Chaeyon, they're so cool. Also Hitomi and Nako, they're so cute. Same also with Sakura, her pronounciation improved a lot.  Hyewon also improved she's a lot better now. Yu Ri's so good. One of my favorite debut songs. Wiz*one PH please stream more till 10 million views
Me_nix 1	Waaaaaaww!!!!! Perfect my Iz*One 💜💜💜 chaeyeon is the best loooove her so much 🌸💙💙💙
Juyoung Im	한글 댓글은 어디쯤?
ran lay	Finally my queens 💜💜
Karl Wendell	I have no idea Yena can rap like that. I saw many comments that she is a rapper before the debut. Where did they get that info????
yanyan	thought hyewon is the main rapper, what happened?
Kousei nazareno	*Halloween? Na Na Na Navidad*
YUJU BE MINE	i think yuri as main vocal and chaewon as lead vocal
eia barland	Are they in spotify yet? 😭😭
ツムツムムッムッ	日本人
Claire Hofferson	I saw this as an ad while I was watching Astro and I saw Eunbi I was like:  Who is this girl? I like her voice and damn she's really good.   So I searched their group name and I didnt know the song then I saw it on trending #1 😫😫
Mich	Can someone tell me why they're trending? Like I'm just curious to know this girl group😊 Hope you won't take it as form of hate😂
Reve luv Red velvet 愛してる	라비앙로즈 노래 너무 좋은거 같아요♡♡

yuq! idle	사쿠라 카와이~~~~♡♡
JD Pascual	Sakura deserves more attention... Make her the center :D
Cindy Love	I love BTS but this kpop is corny as hell. The inorganic click farm is at it again to get kpop on trending...but doesn't mean it's actually good. If anything objectifies woman as blank looking doll face objects and reminds me of Kpop girls used as sex slaves with wealthy and powerful patrons and their recent suicides.  Not everything brings pride.
Eunice Unnie	Omg!! Eunbii! And Chaeyeon totally killing it! Actually theyre all killing it!!

michelle leon	wow this is a bop. way better than i expected.
chicharonwithsuka	I think Chaeyeon and Eunbi are the real deal in this bunch. I can see them going solo after the group disbands. Yuri may also go solo given her role here but Chaeyeon and Eunbi are the closest to Chungha and Sejeong that we can get. I think Yena is a triple threat too but she fits more in a group concept because of her personality.
Jake Kim	No one is talking about Jo Yuri~ :(. She has good vocals and personality. Shes cute and and is just great. If u watch her when she gets picked 3rd place in the final 12, u'll get what i mean by great personality. Im just obsessed with her lol. Yuri bias 4 lyfe

Tahnia Jannine	This song came out almost two days ago as of today. A week ago, I didn’t really pay attention to their debut, but I watched a few episodes of Produce 48 prior due to my close friend being addicted to it. My friend told me to watch their debut song so I did. By now I can name all of them, rank them and I also memorized the lyrics. I guess I became as big of a wiz*one as my friend in a span of 31 hours

I NEED MONEY FOR THE CONCERT!!!	I'm speechless the visual is no joke omg!   Chaeyeon being the center is so overwhelming also she dances well. As expected she's the main dancer of this generation. Minjoo as the visual goddess , so many pretty girls in izone but minjooyah caught my heart also when she says "red" omg!!!! Chaewon another angel my baby is slaying even tho she doesn't have more lines her visual is perfect. Hitomi my mochi doesn't have enough lines huhuhu but i understand jline doesn't suit this concept im waiting for the color*iz baby mochi. Hyewon our main rapper goddess , i can't unsee her innocent aura when she raps hahaha lol so cute hyewon unnie Nako chan our cutie main dancer ahh i live for this i love u so muchie smol bean Eunbi omma she slay with her vocals i cant lol im inlove with eunbi since produce 48 i cant choose my bias. Yena our vocal turn rapper but she kill both as expected golden member of izone all of them are golden can sing , can dance , can rap but Yena has +1 because shes funny. Yuri yaaaah i cant with her highnote 15 years old did that omg! When i was 15 y.o all i did was study as always. Sakura tan another visual goddess even tho she doesn't have enough lines its okay she slays my heart Wonyoungiie maknaengi this giant maknae never fail to impress us she's always doing her best that's why i love her so muchie.  Word of the day: Slayyyyy Bias: Error not found *i cant choose omg* Bias wrecker: *ALL OF THEM*

Richard Wade	What is the name of the fandom for IZ*ONE? If new fans are being excepted, I'd like to be one. I like the MV. I started following kpop when SNSD was at the top of the kpop world. This group has some great potential to become a rising star in kpop: 12 members, amazing synchronize dancing, and fantastic vocals. This group has what it takes, and I'm cheering them on and hope they utterly smash the charts.
Vay W	Here’s just a little rant. For the ioi i didn’t watch the show before so when the group came out i didn’t care who was in the group because they were the only ones i knew. However, now that i was along for the journey for this one i just can’t stan them. It feels like all the ones i loved were shat on and these girls (as much as they were great) were some of the girls i was rooting against either for them being wayyyyy to young or for other reason. I’m only happy with two of the group members. I really wish i never watched the show. It really ruined the group for me.

Stephanie Lor	to be honest, I was one of the people that thought that they were gonna flop but I gotta be honest, this is a really good debut song!! I usually watch the Produce 101 series but for Produce 48, I wasn’t really into it but when I watched a couple performances on the show, I found someone that I wanted to support but unfortunately she didn’t make it into the top 12. I don’t plan on stanning IZ*ONE but I probably will be checking on their music :)

muzik-man lover	Okay. I can admit when I am wrong. I'm still pissed that Kaeun got eliminated from this group, and with that, I was not cheering for them, but after seeing and listening to this debut, I have to honestly say that, yes, I am still pissed that Kaeun is not in this group, but this is a damn good debut, from the video, the voices, and the presence of the girls. Nice job, girls. I think I will become a fan, in spite of Kaeun being eliminated. And, by the way, who is at 2:05? She is gorgeous!

Merc	just WOW! I'm a forever blackjack and never really became super fan of other kpop girl groups. I do appreciate other kpop girl group songs other than 2NE1 but this group will definitely have a place in my heart :) I love them all! you can easily differentiate them, they have their own personalities with great impact. I will watch produce 48 to know them more! my bias so far is Chaeyeon and Nako!!!

Zombie Singer	Creo que esta no es una canción debut apropiada porque: 1. No resalta ninguno de los talentos de las chicas excepto Yena, Yuri y Chaeyeon quienes son presentadas como 'principales' (rappera, vocalista y bailarina). 2. La canción no tiene el impacto que se genera en el expectante, quiero decir, para alguien que no haya visto p48 o no sepa siquiera de la existencia del programa y no conoce a las chicas como nosotros quienes lo seguimos capítulo a capítulo, la canción no tiene la chispa, no se queda en la mente y además que, como antes dije, no resalta nada de las chicas.  3. El MV es muy repetitivo y predecible, los vestuarios no son nada llamativos al igual que la escenografía la cual se ve muy, muy básica. 4. La coreografía es sencilla, pero se esconde entre los colores de la escenografía y los vestuarios.  5. Los juegos de cámara no son tan buenos. De hecho no son nada buenos, como si quienes los hayan hecho no tuviesen ninguna experiencia.   A lo que quiero llegar es que: la agencia no demostró que hizo todo lo posible para el debut del 'nuevo grupo de la nación', no dejaron ver a cada una de ellas como únicas sino que las pusieron allí a su suerte frente a las cámaras, no muestran su propia esencia ni resaltan cada una por sí solas. Me parece bastante triste aquello puesto que aún hay alguna que otra quienes no me convencen del todo en el grupo ni me convencieron en programa. De la letra no hablaré puesto que no conozco el idioma y no he visto las traducciones.

Guifang Xu	At first, I was a bit unhappy about the line up. Especially the center. Now that they've debuted, I've finally realized why they were chosen. Each of these girls have something that attracts me to them. To those who I've slept on before, they have gained my attention. The center did a good job in this MV. I thought someone else would've been more fitting for this position. Now I've grown to like her. At first I thought the group would flop. Now I've become their biggest fan 😍

I mean look at that talent and visual;! 6.Chaeyeon with that hair is just asdgdlsbs..  7.Leave Eunbi as one of the Main Vocal and WTF Irene of rv doing there! 8.Chaewon just voice suprise me!! 9.Yujin with that red outfit slay~ the Giant baby is shiningg 10.Nako.. at the center... I just can't breath.. my smoll baby.. 11.Yuri as the main Vocal.. she is the best.. i just can't even.. 12.my Hitomi babyyy.. eventho she have least line .. but her cute voice somehow one of the best part of this song!

Catirella D	La vie « en » rose... Personnellement j’entends " La vie rose ", le « en » ne ressort pas ou alors il est lié au mot précédent. Certains diront, elle chipote. Mais vue que c'est tout de même le titre de la chanson, il aurait été bien que la prononciation de " La vie en rose " soit un peu plus travaillé. L’idée et l’originalité d’un titre en français était bien pensait, au vue que c’est généralement l’anglais qui est le plus choisi en règle général. Mais étonnamment j’attendais mieux, plus rythmer, plus d’originalité niveau choix de la chanteuse d’ouverture... Je n’ai pas eu le déclic que j’ai eu lorsque j’ai entendu et vue la première chanson des Twice, ce fut un coup de foudre immédiat avec les Twice. Bien, mais peu mieux faire.

THE OHER TWO J-LINE IS SO CUTE WHAHAHA NAKO AND HITOMI. I hope Yunjin could have more screentime. I WAS SURPRISE BY YENA. SHE'S VOCALIST BUT HOW DID SHE BECAME THE RAPPER?

Robby Tambunan	Wonyoung - Her visual is outstanding and the fact that she is the center is a good decision  Sakura - She gets quite a lot of part, thats good. Second center <3 Yuri - vocal queen basically  Yena - Unexpected rapper, its funny how she jokingly rap rumor then become a real rapper “Red” Yujin - CF queen is here, aura level is so high Nako - the dance break part thingy so damn good Eunbi - Didn’t know her vocal can be this good and her visual though Hyewon - I thought she’s gonna rap a lot but she sings more. Her voice isn’t strong but she have this pureness and soothing voice Hitomi - The voice is the cutest thing ever Chaewon - underrated vocal, she’s so good and that high note. Yes! Minju - main visual, as expected and she’s quite suitable for center  Chaeyeon - damn so talented, that hair suit her a lot.   Most viewed Kpop MV debut song in 24 hrs ❣️

muskau	I think they probably realized the popularity of the rumor concept and decided to run with it.  You can see the song producers picked the best people for the best parts, Eunbi, Yena, Chaeyoung, Chaewon got picked out for the power hitting parts.  I was just like, whoa.  They can sing and rap alright.  Poor Wonyoung is going to be a foot taller than everyone else by the time shes 18!

NeonBreezz	#23 in the Netherlands which is impressive, There are no KPOP groups higher than this rank besides Blackpink but that’s a collab that’s English so I don’t really count it as KPop.  Edit; wow... they off the grid already. But I’m still streaming my ass of so no worries about losing views

These girls honestly deserve it, cuz yall know theres only 3 japanese girls in here and its suppose to be a global grp... and the 3 who made it needs an applause for enduring and fighting for that spot!! Much love from a multifan :))
Kirana Anugrah	this song is so good, but i still think wonyoung not strong enough to be center. but i hope she can become more stronger and can give strong and suitable aura for different vibe & concept. i can deny that i disagree with several members, but i hope they can be successful.

끼야호	대체로(?) 아쉬워하는 사람들의 의견을 보면 주로  컨셉이나 음악적인 임팩트쪽에있어도,  음악자체가 듣기 별로라는 평은 잘 없는것같다.  나는 이것이 임팩트보다 밸런스에 더욱 집중한 전략에서 나온 의견들이라 본다.  먼저 비주얼적으로, 12명의 모든 이미지를 한곡에 때려박는(?) 전략을 취하면 되려 부담스럽고 피곤할수있다. (한자릿수 그룹도 아닌 두자릿수 그룹이니까..) 사운드적으로는,  데뷔곡에 모든걸 걸고자 자극적인 후크와 포인트를 때려박(?)으면 귀에 착 감길순있어도, 단순하고 자극적인 음악이 되기 쉬울것이다. (초반곡부터 후크나 멜로디임팩트에 모든걸 걸면, 추후 발매곡부터는 전작만 못하다는 평이 계속 따라다닐 위험이 크다. 아이돌의 성공유무는 결국 꾸준히 발전하는걸 보여주는거라 보기때문에..)  레드벨벳도 데뷔곡만 보면 지금처럼 임팩을 크게 하지 않았다. 중장기적으로 일관성있게 브랜드 빌드업을 성공적으로 했기에 지금과같은 레벨이 나올수있었다고 생각한다.  그렇다고 레벨의 데뷔곡이나 아이즈원의 라비엥로즈가 심심한 곡이라는건 결코 아니다. 구성은 뻔할(?)수 있으나 전개가 안정적이고 사운드 완성도가 꼼꼼하다.  파트 분배가 공평하고, 인트로부터 아웃트로까지 모두 비중있고 밸런스있다. 컨셉적으로도 시간이 지나도 고급스러워보일 가능성이 크다.  지금처럼 듣기 부담스럽지 않고 안정적이고 세련되게 노선을 잡은건 좋은 시작이라 본다.   갠적으론 다른 그룹들이 대중들에게 개개인 이미지를 모두 확립한 1~2년차때나 시도할법한.. 안정성 전략을 첫시작으로 보인게 되려 대담해보이기도 한다  ... 지금처럼  아쉽거나 만족스런 평들이  적극적으로 나오는 것은 아이즈원의 시작이 결코 나쁘지 않았음을 반증하는거라고 본다  이제는 추후  그룹이미지를 어떻게 빌드업시킬것인지 지켜보는 재미가 있을것같다.

Yanna J.	아니 애들은 진짜 너무 역대급으로 예쁜데, 노래가 왜이리 구림? 진심 화난다. 이런 예쁘고 끼 넘치고 재능있는 인재들 데리고 이딴 곡이 말이됨? 차라리 프듀때 받은 곡들은 훨씬 더 좋다, 이미지에도 맞고. 아 너무 기대했나? 진심 애들이 아까움. 게다가 대체 노래 컨셉을 모르겠음. 그렇다고 귀에 확 들어오는 사운드나 중독성이 있는 것도 아니고.  비주얼은 진짜 넘사벽 탑급인데, 노래 진심...왜 이런가요? ㅠㅠㅠ  노래 좋으면 진짜 빵 대박 터질 그룹인데;;;; 솔직히 화제성도 뛰어나고 비주얼도 완벽하고 (진심 아이돌 탑급) 재능도 있는 애들 데리고 이게 무슨;;;;;;;; 화나는게 진짜 안타까워서 화가남.

Dan T	This is what women should look like, besides their talent, feminine,  beautiful,  slim and sexy. And how many times have I heard our jealous girls say to me " what have they got that we don't ". Well, you are obnoxious, loud mouth, aggressive, fat and stupid.....do you want me to continue?

Leo Alezar	I just had an idea for IZ*ONE's fandom name! It could be named "Rose*IZ" (pronounced roses/rosiz) because roses are a symbol of love, just like how we love IZ*ONE and how IZ*ONE loves us fans in return. Another thing is that apparently, roses last for a long time, just like our support for them. Also, since most kpop groups get their fandom names through their debut song or debut album (seventeen with carats; shinee with shinee world and etc.) i think it could actually work~! (Bonus: we could also have the fandom color as rose red xD)  if that doesnt though, I saw many people liking "Enozi" which is "izone" backwards and can mean energy. If you guys like it, go and spread~ xD

Anne-Laure Malacquis	Well my favorite group of all time  is ioi  and I would say that their debut song is more appealing  because since 2015 the kpop industry has changed ( and it's totally normal and logic) and because the company who manage them has learn from all the criticism ! I hope that izone will be as popular as their sunbae . From a ioi fan perspective : fighting !

eruaru	The last time I followed a group from the start *this* passionately was Twice, because of Sixteen, and I watched Sixteen because of Chaeyeon, because I already fell for her during her KPOPSTAR days & wanted to see her success but she got eliminated before anything even started for real... When I watched P48 in the beginning, Chaeyeon was the one I was rooting for from the very start -- then I couldn't help it, my heart grew, I became attached to lots of these girls, the same way I'm attached to TWICE's members, I'm looking forward for their growth. But yeah, while Chaeyeon might not be my #1 in my current bias ranking, I actually hope this group will success & continue to be successful because of Chaeyeon? The one I want to see happy the most about the group success is Chaeyeon. Girl deserves the world seriously...

Dio Armando	WE ARE WIZ*ONE !
patchichoco	This is my salty opinion. I love the song. It's a bop honestly. My favorite parts are Chaeyeon and Eunbi's parts but tbh, aside from their vocals, Jo Yuri and Chaewon are lacking in charisma in this video. Is it just me? And I also feel like they're shoving center wonyoung into my face. It just feels off.

Ton Gaming	nako so cute
wing wing wing wing boomerang	IOI, WANNA ONE AND IZ*ONE ARE THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF MY LIFE
그냥저냥	노래좋음. 근데 사실 인기있는곡은 듣기 편하고 따라부르기 쉬운 노래가 인기있고 인기있는 여자아이돌은 누구든지 추기 쉬운 안무를 하는 아이돌이 인기있죠. 첫곡은 힘주고 나온느낌이고 다음부터는 다른시도들도 많이 해주세요~ 그리고 여자아이돌이 중저음노래를 낼꺼면 차분하고 차가운 분위기의 발라드가 어울리고 산뜻한 음색이면(나코) 부드럽고 신나는 댄스가좋죠. 내 취향임 ㅋ

peace peaceful	솔직히 노래 좋은 지는 모르겠다. 다만, 국민청원 어쩌고 하면서 20살밖에 안된 애들한테 친일 어그로 끄는데 반발심으로 이 그룹을 지지한다. 나라간에 교류하는 건 좋은 일이다. 그리고 이 애들이 우익도 아니다. 일본애들과 그룹 결성했다고 친일도 아니다. 정치와 문화는 서로 독립적으로 다루어야 한다. 아베정부를 반대하면서 일본 문화를 즐길 수 있어야 한다. 일본인들에게도 그걸 요구해야 하고. 우리는 서로에게 호기심을 가진 이웃의 사람들이다.

dc marvel	I'm ok with Jlines got fewer lines, they still need training, but holly fuck why they gave wonyoung  minjoo, & hyewon a lot of lines, their vocal quality is too low compared to another KLines just give it to chaewon and ahn Yu jin. Chaewon, Yujin and chaeyeon deserve more. I guess for rap, chaewoon more suitable than yena. This is my objective opinion. Anyway, IZ*One a lot better than Twice which Jihyo that can only sing properly, twice just only have ear catchy high-quality song with low vocal quality.. IZ*One is underrated, stan talent stan IZ*One

And then when the mv came out i didnt just died once but my heart died multiple times every time i am repeating the reply button. Fighting IZONE. FIGHTING Producer show. I will always fan of the show no matter what. From the moment people behind it starting to brainstorm till then end of each season for each group.

cumulus humilis	nako is so short and doesn't really suit the rest of the group. murase sae or kaeun or nayoung would have been a better choice
marie lee	guys please set the setting into loop for this video, and open more tab and do the same i guess it helped. its like watching over and over again automatically
Rick Bui	I usually dont stan other groups other than Gfriend, but I am heavily invested in Yena, Nako, Hiichan and Yuri from produce48 might as well support them in fandom. BTW Chaeyeon and Eunbi killed this MV
Nor Suzylyana Idris	Am i the only one feel like they intented to put sakura as an extra only? Everybody have their strong vocal part but sakura only sing few words... Just a few... Im so sad.

Eser Sedfrey	Can't stop listening to this song.  And the choreography is LIT!
animeship123	The bridge is really nice which is my favorite part. I really wish they would've taken a different path for the chorus though. I feel like it's not as powerful as it could be; otherwise, the chorus feels very weak in comparison to the bridge and verses.

starry	the mv... the music... everything is peak beauty... BUT,,, WTF IS THIS CRUSTY DUSTY YELLOW PSD COLORING IN THE MV,,,, i am literally having the urge to sweep the dust from my screen TTFFFF
Rei Ishiyama	NAKO-chan! 😭😭😭 Actually Jpop lang talaga ako (Akb48 & Mnl48 lang pinakasinusuportahan ko) pero si Nako talaga ang nagintroduce sa akin dito sa Izone (proven fact na talaga na people will get addicted to her performance, Love Whisper) Grabe ang charisma niya na nakuha niya ang non-fan na katulad ko. Nakakabighani 😊. Gambatte Izone!!!

Daehwi Lee	flop
Indah Sri Rahayu	Anjir Eunbi mirip Irene😂❤
Cathleen Mae Hornilla	Congratulations on your debut IZ*ONE! Fighting!!!!
Abby Madrigal	YAAAAAASSSSSSS LETS GET IT GIRLSSSS
Krisantus Danu	After the final episode of pd48, i've told myslef that i'm not going to stan them. Because i was and still stan ioi and because gaeun didn't make it to the final lineup.   However, this debut song and concept just WOW me. I expect an EDM, quirky, cute concept just like ioi (it must be boring if they do the same concept as ioi tho). But what i see is BEYOND expectation.. this concept is perfect
real sira07	red ♥
lore kim	Such agreat group😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏🌹
Tiến Vũ	Xem như lồn ý
남작	조금 애매 . 무비자체가 난해하다. 뭐 그렇게 의미를 집어넣으라고 했는지 소품들이 뜬금없다. 그냥 한편의 예술영화 같이 미장센은 뛰어나나 재미가 없다.  혹시 무비 작가가 여성인가 . 아름답기만 하면 내용이 없어도 되나 싶다.   컬러라이즈라길래 개개인의 색을 보여줄 거라는 기대 싹 깨뜨려버렸다. 보여준게 없어. 안무만 잔득 찍어놔서 안무영상인줄 알았다.  생각 보다 멜로디는 좋은데 가사는 전혀 안들린다. 무비는 뒷바침을 전혀 안해주고  혼란만 가중시킨다. 트와이스를 보고 배끼라고는 못하겠다. 그치만   예술뽕이 취해서 느낌만 있는 노래만 부르지 않길 바랄뿐이다.
BLACKPINKEU	#LaVieEnRose
Trung Quang	God they so beautiful!
mun	this is an actual bop
Taehyung X Jimin	KIM CHAEWON YOU FINALLY STOLE MY HEART NOW

미야옹	한국인 없낭
ᴤʟᴇᴇᴘʏ ᴄʜᴇɴ	Why’s this trending? It’s not even catchy, but I hope they get higher than BP
wonpil's iba juice	This turned out better than what I expected. I mean I love IZ*ONE since PD48 but I thought they rushed their debut since it hasn't been long since they were formed but DAMN! They gave justice to my girls. 💜

Phuong Thao Nguyen	No offense but I skip all of WonYoung's part. She doesn't deserve to get that much screentime. My baby Nako's line as well as the J girls' is so f**king short too what the hell is going on here? This would be a much better song without all of these talentless girls who have nothing but their faces.

Jasmine Tiu	This song is so well made. They utilise their vocals so well it gives you chills. And this kinda sounds like an anthem. Like how Loona's anthem is favOriTe and Bboom Bboom for Momoland (?).
Ryan Shah	Bruh I’ve never heard of them before, but I see them trending at #8 and I must say... these are some Monster Rookies. 😂👌🏾

YOUNG-IEL JANG	이 노래 선곡한 인간 누구냐? 진짜 궁금하다. xx
Jezreel Jumalon	I love this song the first listen. It's a breath of fresh air from all the other Produce debut songs. It doesn't sound like your typical poppy girlgroup debut song, and they found a way to mesh the cute, sexy, girlcrush concepts into one dynamic track, and also still keep it catchy enough melodically and lyrically.   Personally, the chorus was very good, as it is in its subtlety yet strong instrumentaion that makes it a unique part, kinda like taking off on a plane, and then stay there up at the sky, rather than dropping to a heavy beat. Overall one of my favorite Produce songs.
Ong Seongwoo's Mouth	Excuse me. 😍🌹 Let me kill the replay button. 👆🔁

wasabisazzdafirst	confession: i honestly thought the line up was gnna be a flop in terms of music performance since there were no main rappers in the line up. ngl i was very disappointed when chowon didnt get in, she is in fact more talented than some of the girls in the group. but the music was very well done its different from other debut songs, it exceeded my expectations. wonyoung did so good as the centre oml she is indeed the golden maknae uwu
LA La land	The only problem I have with the new I O I is the fact that I feel like I see the same person over and over whereas the old IOI were all unique and individual IDK

AHLegacy 6960	This is beyond my expectations I'm crying. Amazing debut. Bold of you to think that they're going for cutesy when there's queen eunbi. The killer for this concept. What is izone without Kwon Eunbi. She is MAD TALENT. Im truly happy to notice how mostly new fans came for her. Don't even make me start with her holy visual. Stan izone right now cowards! 😍😍😍
Krystlyn Jung	Yena expressed that she is a vocalist in Chu, but here she is, being a rapper! Yena truly has the full package : rapping, singing, dancing, and visuals. I am really proud of her challenging new boundaries, well done Yena 💖 I hope in future promotions, we can more of her lovely vocals as well!
OnceArmy Forever	Congratulations to IZONE and  Wizone on their fantastic and very successfull debut with La Vie en rose!

Rodrigo Fuentealba	hermosoo me encanta
Kaelyn Papa	FOR NEW FANS:  0:03 - Jang Wonyoung, our center, our giant maknae (14 years old), everyone loved her as the center in their first performance in produce48, when they performed "very,very,very" by ioi in the group battle   0:18 - Kim Minju, she used to lack confidence and was very conscious of herself while rehearsing for Pick Me! in produce48 but as we can see now, she has improved and is very stunning, she is friends with fellow idol Kriesha Chu   0:21 - Ahn Yujin, she is in the same agency as Wonyoung (Starship), some people called her a talentless visual before but she proved everyone wrong regardless (just look at her vocals during their vocal check in their last performance in produce48, "please take care of me", she is also very funny and lively as seen in the first episode of IZ*ONE CHU, which you should all watch btw   0:24 - Miyawaki Sakura, she is a japanese, the ace of HKT48, in the first episode of pd48, she had "fire" in her eyes because she was really passionate bc her fellow japanese members were getting "F", "D" etc. She is the first center in produce48, she is also a gamer, she has a youtube channel filled with her playing video games such as fortnite etc. At first, you may think she is a very proper lady and at times she is, but she has a weird (good kind of weird) personality which is pleasing to me at least, i love heeerr, she is shipped most with Lee Chaeyeon hehe    0:29 - Kim Chaewon, she is from Woollim Entertainment, to be honest, a lot of people were shocked that she made it in the top 12 but i always thought from the beginning that she had potential, her vocals are soooo soothing to the ears, i love hearing her sing and the girl can also dance, watch their dance rehearsal for Rumor which is to be shown in showcon hehe    0:31 - Kang Hyewon, she is from 8D Creative, to be honest, just like a lot of people i did not think she deserved her spot in the top 12 but now, i think that i wasn't thinking in the right mind then because a group needs to be balanced, it cant be filled with people who are good at everything hehe, she also has time to improve and i love her passion and fire when she was in the team filled with japanese people in the group battle for "Boombayah", she tried out rapping despite never rapping before then she tried it out again in the Position Evaluation. She sacrificed herself during boombayah (which lead to great results), because in her audition, she was aiming for the innocent visual but then that happened haha. Her parents even joked what if she rapped the whole time in Produce48, which actually happened, she said "That's why you don't say those kind of things" or smth like that haha, watch produce48 to know!!   0:36 - Honda Hitomi, she is from AKB48. She is like a bunny hehe, she has a small voice, i looovee heerr. She surprised everyone during their rehearsals for "Pick Me!" in pd48 because despite the other Japanese members not being able to catch up during the rehearsals due to lack of training, she danced really well in the C Class and that is because she used to be a cheerleader and a dancer. That's why in some AKB48 clips of her, she is seen tumbling and stuff hehe she's really cute and there's this one variety show in Japan where she was hit on the head really hard that she cried huhu.   0:40 - Lee Chaeyeon, MY BIAS! She is from WM Ent. and in her audition in pd48, she choreographed "Shower" with fellow trainees and even had to impromptu dance "Instruction" and it was great! Trainer Bae Yoon Jeong really loves her <3 She is a really great dancer and a great vocalist!! She can hit those high noteesss, check out their performance in 1000%, she is just great but she doesn't know it herself because in that same performance during the rehearsals, she said she didnt try out for center because she thinks a center needs to be confident and pretty and she said that she's neither, SHE IS SO PRETTY INSIDE AND OUT AND SO FREAKING TALENTED. She also joined Sixteen and KPOP STAR 3   0:45 - Kwon Eunbi, she is sometimes called the mom of the group, she is the oldest and also so freaking talented, she is a great dancer and a great vocalist too. Tbh tho, everyone knew she was going to debut lol ( i wrote so many things i wont make this super duper long now )   0:55 - Jo Yuri, she is from Stone Music Ent., she joined idol school before but didn't get to debut. She is a great vocalist and debuted as the top 3 in pd48, it was unexpected but she deserved it. The girl can hit thoosee nootteeess    1:28 - Choi Yena, she is from Yuehua, this girl is extremely funny, she can do all sorts of things with her mouth, look it up on yt. She is the center in their last performance in pd48 "You've fallen, right?". She used to be main vocal Yena but now she's rapper Yena hehe and it suits her voice in my opinion. Her brother, Choi Sungmin used to be an idol, part of the group SPEED.    1:45 - Yabuki Nako, she is from HKT48 same as Sakura. This girl is sooo smoooll she is so cuutee hehe, she is also a talented vocal, she shocked everyone during the first group battle.    Sorry for this long comment, what do you think of the IZ*ONE girls? Watch IZ*ONE CHU! Stan them! You can still stan your main group and stan them, nothing wrong with it. Let's all love each other! La Vie En Rose! <3

joshua jang	사쿠라가 한국애인줄 알았슴. ㅋㅋ 부탁인데 이 프로그램이 한일합작프로그램이라는 것을 잊지 말기를 바람.  오늘같이 일본아이를 소외시키는 것은 좋지 않음. 적어도 12분의 3이상은 일본아이에게 분량을 무조건 배분해야 할 것임.  오늘은 프렌들리 하게 말했지만 다음에도 또 일본애를 소외시킨다면 분노할 것임.  참고로 나는 친일파가 아님. 그러나 공정을 어기면 분노하는 기질이 있는 사람이 더 많다는 것을 밝혀 주고자 함.

KatRin	I like the debut song, I absolutely love Chaeyeon's parts, her voice is really beautiful. I really like Eunbi's and Chaewon's singing and Sakura looks amazing. She has a great presence and is great performer. I love the second little part of Nako in the song together with Eunbi's and Chaeyeon's parts. I love the staggered part of the dance, looks very cool with the 12 of them.  I HATE the hat on Sakura and whatever that white thing was on Nako's head, I hate these blank stare shots.. sitting at the table, standing under those hanging balls, staring into the sunshine awkwardly standing next to each other... Can we move on from these trend?

N.S. Asri	with so many members, I like seeing AKB in better version (no offensive). Sakura more lit here, even she is not the center or just have little line part.
Tôn Thái Anh	Nice song. I like this song.
「チューン」Tune	AHHHH I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS (*´ω｀*) the song is a bop! I like that it's not super high pitched and is easy to sing along with and suits the members' variety of voice types. The choreo is pretty and the overall theme is just so nice and classy, I love it. The styling is on point with the classy white outfits and then the slightly more edgy black and red outfits. A super fantastic debut!! The pre-chorus sounds so good and also the kinda romantic sounding guitar? sounds in the background? It's just super great! I woke up at like 5:50 am EST (50 min after they dropped the MV) because I was so excited to see them debut and I was internally screaming because THEIR DEBUT IS SO GOOOOD. Good luck izone!! looking forward to your future endeavors. 応援してる！！デビュー曲めっちゃやばい (´;ω;｀)全部素敵！！！！ファイト！！

Karasu Ootori	Kim minjooooooo
Kanaru Abe	Coming from AKB48 groups fandom (very casual one anyways and a very performance-focused fan) and a very occassional k-pop listener. If I sound very calm and not emotional, don't worry, that's my way.  Very good performers, and honestly my 48G-fan side is proud of Sakura, Nako and Hitomi. I don't "oshi" them (that's our equivalent to k-pop "stan"), but I am happy of them because clearly they had improved a lot as performers and the strict training benefitted them. And I know that the average performance of most k-pop groups on dancing and singing is often a higher bar than for most j-pop female idols, and especially 48G.  The Korean ladies clearly will have the chance of have most parts, obviously. I liked a lot this lady Yena, and Yuri. The dancing, generally very nice.  Nako and Hitomi clearly are the cuties, and Nako's voice shines due too cute, she had been used to sing this way because of her image in HKT48. I wonder how management will manage this. Hitomi I don't know her much. Sakura... I think my concept of her improved a lot, it's clear that practice could make her very good and be a proper performer. Not surprised at all of she being considered a visual for the IZ*ONE fandom, this lady is really a good-looking one. But before of P48 I had her as only that: A typical cute and pretty idol in a group of an idol industry that does not really care that much about performance. And I already had my favourites on 48G who I like more as dancers and singers. But the k-pop Sakura had earned my respect. I wish her the best the same way as the rest of IZ*ONE.  And, the song, very nice. Good job of agency, show and members.
Hazy Moon	Hitomiii~~♥♥
Francis Bacon	Damn these visuals are no joke
maybe someday	Chaeyeon really caught my eye. Not your typical beauty but I love her aura. And something tells me that she is a really really good dancer. Overall this seems like a promising group, looking forward seeing more. I don't want to get too attached, though, because I know they won't be here for long. I get very sad at goodbyes💔

ガゼットRuki	How can ppl said Chaeyeon is not good looking till she got depressed and unconfident when she looks so beautiful in here?? I don't get it why. She has nice facial expression to express the feeling of the song. And btw Yena rap style somehow reminds me to Sohyun 4minutes and Hitomi has a unique timbre voice that made her line sounds satisfying for me. Those three got my attention a lot. It's not like the others not good but I already know what they are like and not really give me surprise in this mv. It's just my opinion tho. Catchy song for debut, good for them

ᴀɴᴏɴʏᴍᴏᴜs	What IZ your colour fams?
Miyu Soriano	Small screen time for Sakura and other 2 japanese girls.. Why?😭
Kim MiraneRose	This concept is something I’ve never seen before. I’m addicted to this. I’ve been following them since their Produce 48 days, and to those who say Hyewon is untalented, you’ve never seen her in real life and neither do I. I’m sure she’s talented, I believe in her. There was a reason she decided to become an idol anyways. Yes, she may not express it often, but for true fans who decided to stay loyal to the group starting today, they know for sure she’s gonna improve and I do as well. And for the Japanese line. People keep on saying the have very few lines. People, they’re Japanese not Korean. The reason they have few lines is because of their pronunciation. I’m not saying they don’t know how to pronounce Korean, but as time goes by, their pronunciation will improve and soon they’ll be able to speak fluent Korean without having a cheat sheet and get more lines. So relax, they only debuted. All of the members have skills they still have yet to improve, not just Hyewon, Sakura, Nako and Hitomi. And please, for the love of God, don’t say mention other groups in the live show-con. It’s a debut showcase just for the girls. Not for BTS, EXO, TWICE, BLACKPINK or other groups. It’s their time to shine, why block it by mentioning groups who are their seniors? Just because they’re better than them? Seriously? Fans are supposed to represent and carry the name of their idols on their backs, not only you’re disrespecting the group and it’s fans, also your idols name and the fandom you’re in. Being like that gives a bad reputation for the idols and the fandom. You don’t want that right? So better keep your insults to yourself and shut your mouth. Nobody needs to hear and see any of it.  Anyways, IZ*ONE has an interesting concept. It makes me want to listen more of their songs and fall in love with them. fighting girls! And good luck on your journey to become like your seniors, I.O.I and Wanna One.

Aly Recinos	I was worried that with so many young members the debut song would be cutesy and weak, like April pre-April Story. Or that they would go more mature and make it super awkward for the young members. This was such a great path. It was elegant and beautiful.

LUCAS’s NUGGET	thank god wonyoung didn’t get a lot of lines, it’s better if they give the other members more attention than her.  (Don’t attack me, it’s my opinion, I just don’t think she should be 1st place at all)

Jay Min	AI QUE LINDAS SOCORRO MEU CORE NÃO GUENTA 💕💕💕💕💕
Milena Suzuki	Wooooooow I'm impressed! They all look and sound so beautiful and refined <3 This concept suits them so well too, we have some seriously classy ladies here... And even though some of my favorite girls (like Cho Won, Miyu and Miru) didn't make it, I'll keep following IZ*ONE for sure <3   Maybe mixing the languages would highlight the "global group" aspect more and give the few Japanese member more lines... I mean, we have English and (quasi) French, but no Japanese?
Abdelnaser Sajeda	They debuted on my birthday 😇
can't think if a username	why is this song so good?? wait no *why are they so talented??*
lar ayquipa romero	Dance practice
Joanne Rajan	IZ*ONE is killing it!

IZ*ONE fighting!
The Potato	Treading number 9 in USA(Rip replay button)
ʏᴏᴜ'ʀᴇ sᴏ ʙᴇᴀᴜᴛɪғᴜʟ	ok but can someone tell me who that is at 1:44
KpopCpopUtaites multifandom	Honestly, none of my picks from pd48 ended up making Iz*one, HOWEVER, these girls do deserve it. Maybe other trainees were more strong in certain areas but making a good idol group isn't just about skill. It's also about how the public sees you. These girls all worked hard for what they got and the public adores them. Also, don't be too worried about your favorites not debuting. A perfect example would probably be Soyeon- She went from 20th place on pd101 to debuting in a monster rookie group(You don't have to be a stan to recognize that they are v successful) Don't take your frustrations that your fave didn't debut on these girls.

Tramaine Terrance	Hello, Humans. For breakfast, I drink acid and eat a bear. It's very important for me, to start my day off the right way. Before I go to sleep at night, I like to do my special routine. This consists of, drinking 15oz of wolf's blood, covering my balls in hot oil, pouring hot bacon grease in my eyes, fighting a lion, dancing with a dozen cobra snakes and finally, beating my meat, while eating a bag of marshmallows. It all works out in the end. Go to sleep, wake up and start all over again. Life is always best when it's quiet and simple.  TERRANCE OUT

Midousuji Akira	So they kick out so many talented girls for ones with a cute image and visual but give them *this* type of sophisticated debut song??!?!?! I'm confused.

Serena Antony	Who stan IZ*ONE OT12?❤❤

carryingyourheart	chaeyeon is one of the most well rounded idols. same with seulgi and chungha.
amalia	This song was made for Chaeyeon, Yuri, Yena and Eunbi. All the girls did amazing, but the 4 of them really stood out and embraced the concept sooo well. Hopefully in the future the J-line will get some more lines. But other than that they couldn’t have had a better debut! I’m so excited to support them for the upcoming 2 years!
Sun Hi	OMG
TWICE are GFRIEND's girlfriends	Will I regret not buying the album?
Kannah Aki	the song is great; it's charming and lovely; and their voices are outstanding but to be honest, it doesn't have the "hooked" part or "killing" part that can't make some people (at lest to me) impress or keep repeating it. It's little bit average but it's just my opinion though.
Saak :v	YAAS GIRLS ♡ I LOVE EUNBI ♡
Kpop Multi stan	I’ve been messing around with the speed of the video and if you listen to ‘La Vie en Rose’ in 1.25 it’s legitimately sound good. But of course is the original better
rouse BV	Chaeyeon♡,Yena♡,Sakura♡,Hitomi♡, EunBi♡, Minju♡, Nako♡
luisa gutierres	I did not like anything, I expected all to leave equally in the video although some would not sing, I almost did not see sakura and how little it was because I fixed a lot but did not look at it, I know there is a main girl but in all the video clip only came out about 5 out of 12, it seems very ugly, that's why the big kpop groups never came to me because you never get to know all the members or go unnoticed, a foreign fan bothers !! !
Belles	This such a good debut song!!! Everyone's so beautiful and slaying it!! Stan IZ*ONE y'all. ❤️
Cristian Aguileta	No lo esperaba , realmente me sorprendieron ,son increíbles chicas y muy bien la empresa con la producción  espero ver muchos conceptos nuevos con izone :)

arabella	When I saw the teaser images i really misjudged this group. I thought they were like the typical girly gg. Even tho they are kinda girly, I liked it. The song is great! Vocals are good, voices don’t sound too forced,  the dancing is good  and the MV is also great. I don’t have enough time, money and space in my heart to stan them lol but I hope they keep making good music and grow a big fan base ❤️ oh and btw I feel so happy for chaeyeon, seeing her in sixteen and then finally debuting here, she deserves it.
KMN Ongoing	Seriously, I’m so impressed with Eunbi’s powerful voice. OMG I didn’t even notice her when she was in Produce48.

Isabella B	YENA 😍💗
Baby Angel	can anyone give me some info on them? i love this
bluexSae	I'm so happy rn !! This song is a bop, this is a great concept omg and it suits them so well ! They're all so pretty 😭
SuperBlueRock K-POP's Top Ranking	I'm not a fan of this group but in terms of major talents I would just say Chaeyeon (blond one?), Eunbi (black hair one?), Yena (rapper?) and Yuri (reddish/orange-ish hair?) slayed. But I also wanted to say Wonyoung is absolutely stunning ! They're all pretty but Wonyoung's visuals is above them all in the group.  EDIT: I literally learned those 5 names, just to say that.
pasteltuna	this mv is SO fast-paced omg?? love the song tho <333

The jam to my Kookie	Yuri's vocals and Chaeyeon's looks and Yena's rap slayed my whole existence 😍😍❤
serena	JUSTICE FOR JLINE!!! sakura, nako and himoti deserve the same amount of lines than the other girls, why are always the same girls singing? the line distribution sucks and the screentime too. And don't even try to come to me with that crap of ThEy ArE 12, with more reason they should have a fair line distribution, and let's not talk about the korean members with 1 line too. Don't call them global group if the girls from other country can't get the same opportunities, period.
inu nine	확실히 유진,혜원,민주,꾸라 같이 이목구비가 도드라져야 카메라가 잘 받는구나...

ATAKOOKIE	They are going to be famous
laley 27gamgyul	I didn't watch PD101 so the only thing I knew about this is that a lot of ppl were complaining about the final lineup, and that everyone loved some girl named Sakura. I'm also honestly not into girl groups as much, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was a really nice song! I'm relieved they didn't do some sugar sweet cute concept, and it was mature enough without getting weird (I'm assuming these girls are on the younger side), it felt nicely balanced. This definitely doesn't deserve the amount of dislikes it got, just because people are disappointed if their faves didn't make it to the final group. Looking forward to hearing more of their music!
The Maknae Line	MIBUTATO 💕 HAHA

Tuan :v	Princesinhas do kpop💓amo
Daniel Kang	음... 이미 호감 가진 상태라 객관적이기 힘들겠지만 노래에 중독성이 딱히 비난 받을정도로 없는 편은 아닌거 같은데. 생각보다 머리속에 남네요. 무난한 느낌은 알겠는데 너무 튀다가 더 구릴 가능성도 높다고 봅니다. 애초에 노래 무진장 잘 뽑아도 이번에 복귀할 아이돌 그룹 이기고 1위까지는 힘듭니다.
Natt Lee	Oh i like jo yuri's vocal tone
louisa	Dont really like the final lineup but damn this song is so fuckin good

Chill D.	12 girls trying to achive their dreams together... Before I met Produce 48, I had a depression😔. It was really hard for me because I couldn't talk about it to anyone and I almost committed a suicide. But then suddenly I found Produce 48 and IZ*ONE😢❤ I was so grateful that I've found them🙄💜💜IZ*ONE is the group that has cope my depression🙌🏻. Now that I'm healthy, I will support IZ*ONE forever❤
Chriss KA	I didn't watch P48 so I'm not familiar with their face. I really appreciate the voice of the girl with short hair (its not Sakura) and the one at 2:33.She sounds so good! As a Frenchie I was attract by the title and wanted to see how they were gonna pronounce it lol and good job!  But I wouldn't say it's a unique debut but this is a good debut song that catch your attention.

Eirikur Thorvaldsson	As a french🇫🇷, I gotta complain on something : i'm bothered by the fact that they pronounce the french title with an american accent.  Edit: especially because "La Vie en Rose" by Edith Piaf is probably the most French song that ever existed so I was hoping some nice French touch in it 😅  Other than that, great song, great everything. 😆
rf shark	OMG I LIKE THIS MV, SONG, DANCE AND I LOVE IZ*ONE❤❤❤❤❤❤
ramenfighter	omg this is so good, they exceeded my expectations 🌹❤️
OTAKU LEISHA	seriously ive been sleeping on chaewon. CHAEWON IS CLIMBING MY BIAS LIST,, although she aint here much she’s totally my second bias here after eunbi. Wow i love the girls.

Leona Silver	Dis-donc, on essaierait pas de gratter la communauté kpop en France en les flattant avec un titre en français ?  Ok c'est compréhensible on est les meilleurs 😏
Ryan Bloomingdale	Wonyoung proved that she's perfect as the group's center. Sakura proved that she's still an amazing visual and performer despite not being the center. Yuri proved (once again) that she's main vocal material. Yena proved that she really can do anything by rapping like a pro. Yujin proved that she's lead vocal material (and jumped way up my bias list). Nako proved that she's an amazing dancer and her height doesn't have anything to do with her talent. Eunbi proved once again that she can also do anything and is the perfect leader for this team. Hyewon proved that she was meant to be in this group and is quickly improving as a rapper, vocalist, and dancer. Hitomi proved that she's a great vocalist and a great dancer (and also is wrecking my bias list). Chaewon proved that people really slept on her during PD48 (including me) and showed off her amazing voice. Minju proved that she was also meant to be in this group, showing off her confidence in her vocals and dance. Chaeyeon proved (once again) that she's an amazing dancer/vocalist and is loved by many despite placing 12th.  I used to be a hater. Now, in the past few months, I've realized that this lineup is perfect and was always meant to be.  Here's hoping every other hater gives them a chance. Love this song!

Cool Cole	I think we can all agree. WE SHOOK! I totally thought they were gonna do a cute concept. But they debut as powerful queens🎉 yes plz
Otaku Taku	Can anyone please explaine to me how come the concept is about the red colour while the title is LA VIE EN ROSE, I mean it would have been much better if it was LA VIE EN ROUGE to match the concept, btw i kw LA VIE EN ROSE IS LIKE A FAMOUS FRENCH EXPRESSION that means life is beautiful . anyways dont mind me it just confuses me; P.S i love IZONE so much especially SAKURA
MiU	I dont want to make you pooo

Le Cruset	The song is good. But i have a criticism about the mv...... What's up with the unfair screen time? Some members are shown alot while some are constantly blurred out/not in frame.....I can understand "unfair line distribution" because it creates a better finished product but unfair screen time is unforgivable :(

Daniela C.	Me siento orgullosa ver como varias han mejorado, en expresión y todo, aunque no estaba conforme al principio con la línea final, lo hicieron muy y las apoyaré hasta el final❤
Quinquina Chaquira Chacova	Está buena la canción, muy en la tendencia, especialmente el coro (que resulta débil luego de la fuerza de la estrofa o puente, pero bueno, supongo que es la idea). Las chicas lucen hermosas todas, aunque aún les falta un poco de cohesión, pero tendrán dos años para pulirse. Al ver a muchas con el pelo claro, me sorprendió, luego de recordar un comentario de alguien que justificaba la eliminación de Go Yujin debido a haberse teñido de rubia 😒... En fin. Suerte a las chicas, y mientras esperamos el también debut de las otras finalistas de PD48 😉

Gilang Purwa	Hitomi !!!!!!!!
Music Is Life	I am actually surprised i wasnt too excited after listening to the track medley but this sounds better than how it was on the medley (all songs not just this one)
Sakura Kawano	i wanted more lines for nako and hitomi.... TT but yena! rapping! omg! ><
senshi	monster rookies ❤️
Yuky Bel	Chaeyeon the best ❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍😘😘😘😘
안훈	애정으로 본 내 입장을 솔직하게 말하자면 아이즈원 별로다 개개인의 매력을 살리지도 못할뿌더러..그룹으로써도 별로다... 한명한명으로 정말 좋아하는 입장으로 보려고 해도 별로다. 프로듀스에서 보이던 매력들도 없어졌을뿐 아니라... 이게 뭐 하는 건지도 사실 모르겠다.. 내가 기대치가 너무 높았던걸까? 아싸리 연습생일때가 더 보기 좋았다면 오바하는걸까? 브이로그도 찾아서 봤지만  그냥 가식적이다 연예인같지도 않고 그냥  별로다 아트스트적인 면도 없다 별로다.. 칭찬이나 비판을 할수도 없다 비판할 만한것도 칭찬할 만한것도 없다..그냥 별로다... 물론 노력했겟지...열심히 했겠지...  그걸로 된걸까?  결론은 별로다 ..
Nabil Saad	I love the concept, everyone shines so much, great line distribution too, also Chaeyeon ily <3
에오	딱 한번만 장원영얼굴ㄹ로 살아보고 싶다
Steven Cunning	This is better than I expected. As the third Produce team to debut, this is a good starting point.  EDIT: After listening to this a few more times, I can expand on my original comment and say this is very good! I like how lessons were learned from the previous Produce Project debuts, particularly IOI's. The styling of the girls come off as bold, beautiful, and respectful. IZ*ONE's debut song and concept is comes off strong, not childish. The song is very pleasant to the ears. I will listening to this on repeat a lot! I also like the subtle use of a shamisen or the mimicking of it anyway. It hints of the background of IZ*ONE. Lastly, the line and spotlight distribution appears to be fair. Everyone got a chance to be seen and sing in the MV.
욱타	그룹은 몇몇 멤버가 맘에 안 들어서 안 좋아하는데 스밍을 안 할 수 없는 노래다... 미쳤다... 존나 잘 뽑았다  프로미스나인도 이런 분위기, 퀄리티로 뽑으면 얼마니 좋으려나

Rahma Tham	Chae Yeon..  😍😍😍
してキス	Man they look great and i love their outfits but I‘m not the biggest fan of the song. Still a nice debut I‘m looking forward for more :)
Chandra Tambunan	Keren... 👍👍
ByungHui Song	타그룹과의 비교라기보다, 출발점의 여건을 놓고 볼때, 멤버도 나름 좋고 다 좋은데, 노래가 좀 아쉽다. 영 안좋은 노래는 아닌데, 수많은 걸그룹중에서 각인될만큼의 대단한 임팩트는 크게 못 느끼겠다. 이정도 멤버인프라와 데뷔빨에, 노래만 좀더 좋았다면 트와이스도 긴장할 데뷔였을거란 생각이 든다.(트와이스는 초기 가창력문제가 좀 있었으나, 잘짜인 멤버에 프로듀싱과 마케팅도 훌륭했고, 노래들도 연이어서 너무 좋았다.) 뭐, 너도나도 트와이스처럼 되길 바라는 것도 무리일테고,그래도 열심히 하다보면 좋은 결과 있을거라 믿는다. 화이팅.
Margely Colli	Eunbi❤ Chaewon💕
워너리즈	Chaewon's visual and Eunbi vocals are no joke 😍😍😍😍😍

this is shinee 5 and we're right by your side	I've a question, before this show aired I remember reading an article saying the final group would consist of 6 korean girls and 6 japanese girls, so why are there only like 3 japanese girls? I never actually saw the show so idk
Regina Nyirubugara	I FEL IN LOVE WITH WONYOUNG!!!! I'M A BIG FAN OF IZ*ONE!! sakura. Nako.  Eunbi, Wonyoung. Chaeyeon, Chaewon, Yuri, Yena, Minju, Hyewon,Yujin, Hitomi SARANGHAE!!!!

Magically Me	My babies are all so pretty and talented and beautiful ugh I love them all so much
FilmMie IRIN	💜💜💜
Rob Chang	It's rare to exceed my expectations since I have very high standards, but La Vie en Rose is a certified mega banger. Eunbi's pre-chorus part is especially captivating with the stronger percussive feel. Probably the best debut I've seen in I don't know how many years.
sweetchaeng	wooow the music is sooooo goood   i love this
pop coconut	수준은 반타작 같은뎅??  다음곡을 기대해 봄.. ㅋ

GoldenMaknae Bangtan	+5M in 24 hour!!!! WE CAN DO IT!!!
toe hi	노래 잘 뽑았네....부드럽게 들리는데 좀더 어두운 부분과 박력적인 부분이 있고...은근히 화려함도 느껴지고....기존에  나온곡과 달라서 노래가 참신하다.. 개인적으로 채원 목소리가 제일 좋음. 청량하면서 부담감을 주지 않고 채연목소리나 은비도 좋음. 메보도 어느정도 되고 안되도 인원수가 많아 다른음색으로 나름 다양하게 들리니...강점이 분명있음...
pyaesonekyaw .j7	Sakura Aura is not joke a ,she kill me visual , style , dance & vocal just amazing ❤

엔리	진짜 ㅋㅋ 기대 안했는데 겁나 좋아서 깜짝 놀랐네
Spring Day	Brazil?🇧🇷
Kalia	딱 엠넷 수준의 노래네. 진심 쓰레기다. 그냥 인기빨로 컨텐츠 팔다 사라질 그룹이겠네. 경연때 음악이 차라리 휠씬 좋았다. 뭔 중국산 노래도 아니고 참나...
Jessie Leung	Why chaewon and yuri look so alike😑😑i thought they are the same person
-	👏👏👏💕
Koe-Koe C.A	Ok... I have to admit that they make a good group together, the original songs are in the point, the covers of PD songs no 😂👌🏻💕  LA LA LA LA VIE EN ROSE!
사민	아,, 뮤비 너무 예쁘다... 내 온갖 취향 다 섞어놓은느낌,, 아쉬운건 노래랄까..내가 너무 기대를 크게 했던건지 노래에 임팩트가 없는건지.. 차라리 아오아 드림걸이 나은거 같기도 하고..ㅜㅠ
SVT Energy Skin Care	Finally my girl Chayeon debut <3
Kamshila Samsuddin	Akhirnya
jinyoung bae	Uhm well, anyone do you know where is sakura and nako line? but RAPPER YENA SLAYING AS WELL
오키스	음..좋아좋아 ~~이대로 1천만넘어 ~~2천만까지~~!! 혜원이 분량이 좀 아쉽지만 다른맴버들도  아쉬울거라생각해 ~! 헤원이가 열심히 해야 미나미도 따라서 열심히하지~~!!

오구오구오구우쮸쮸쭈	이것으로 확실해진 건, 욕을 했든 어쨌든 컨셉잡고 나오니까 완벽한 트레디함을 갖춘 걸그룹으로 일본 친구들은 동화되었다.  누가봐도 이건 프로듀서의 실력차다. 애들 핑계 되면 안되겠다. 그리고 여기 있는 일본친구들이 어제 내가 보고 식겁한 AKB48신곡 센터가 맞는지 두눈으로 몇번씩 보고 의심과 경악을 금치못했다.(아이즈원 라비앙로즈 곡과 컨셉 여자아이돌의 밝은 우아함이 묻어나서 좋다.) 암튼 일본 이제 헛소리못한다. 너네 그 보석같은.애들을 더 잘키워줄 프로듀서를 실력자로 교체해야 일본애들이 살수 있다(습습후후)

David	Minju is stunning
Cocaine	MINJU I LOVE YOU
arthur drss	Izone stann 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song mook Im	아이즈원이 가진 특유의 분위기를 살리는 곡이 아니다.   그 많은 인원의 오디션을 뚫고 올라온 멤버들이 가진 특유의 매력을 어필할 수 있는 후렴도 주목할수있는 댄스파트도 없다.  전형적인 양산형걸그룹 노래이다. 또한 고질적인 일본인보컬 특유의 콧소리가 개선되지 않는다면, 추후 후속곡 가사에 대한 몰입을 방해하는 풀리지않는 숙제가 될 것이다.
Laysa ss	Ahhhhhhh elas são maravilhosas!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😢

KaraKara	I’ll say this again, I LOVE Wonyoung’s voice in studio versions. I didn’t like her until ep 12 of pd 101 lol. And Nako suits Kpop and jpop imo. Also my biases (and everyone else) Chaewon, Yena, and Yuri slaying 😍😍

BTS	아이즈원은 비쥬얼이 센터 원영이가 표정까지 매우 뛰어나고, 사쿠라, 민주, 혜원 얘네들은 다른 걸그룹 센터와 비교해도 비쥬얼이 안밀릴 정도임. 게다가 나코, 히토미 귀요미들까지 가세해서 구색까지 갖추면서 기존에 걸그룹에서 찾기 힘든 묘한 매력이 있음. 유리, 유진, 예나, 채원은 비쥬얼이 좋은데다가 노래와 춤까지 잘함. 특히 아이즈원은 소리 꽥꽥 지르는 가창력 보다는 음색 좋은 애들이 많아서 듣기 좋고 중독성 있는데 특히 채원이가 음색이 진짜 좋음. 춤도 채연, 은비가 워낙 뛰어난데다가 멤버들 골고루 춤을 잘추는 애들이 많은 편이고, 근데 랩이 유민영, 김도아가 데뷔조에서 떨어져서 랩을 제대로 할까? 진짜 걱정됐는데 이번에 예나가 목소리도 랩에 어울리고 꽤 잘하는거 같음. 결론은 현재 잘나가는 걸그룹들 중에 일부 제외하면 많은 걸그룹들이 랩실력이 부족해서 뭔가 2%는 부족하다는 느낌이 있었는데 예나가 1%는 채워 준거 같아서 진짜 고마웠음. 내 개인적인 느낌에 아이즈원이 비쥬얼, 노래, 춤, 랩까지 모든걸 갖춘 걸로 봐서 노래랑 안무만 잘 만들어 주면 앞으로 K-POP 시장에서 크게 발전 할 것 같음.
wonwoo lover	0:41 she reminds me of gugudan's nayoung; just like the girl in the minute 1:20 reminds me of twice's tzuyu; and the 1:37 girl that reminds me of wjsn's exy ❤️ they're so freaking prettyyy btw

Gaby Vega	La canción esta buena no es la gran cosa pero esta buena el video no me gusto le falto algo pero de todos modos se nota que los de mnet no le echaron tantas ganas como a wanna one y ioi porque saben que no van a tener el mismo impacto en marketing a nivel mundial como wanna one, lo mas probable es que se la pasen promocionando solo en Japón

wendy	The line distribution is kind of tragic though , some girls barely got lines. I wish J-line had more lines, especially nako because that great voice is being wasted, but in general I like this concept more than the one of ioi, so I'm grateful this isn't like dream girls 2.0 which for me is horrible but something different.

Happy Leaf	To be honest... I used to think Chaeyeon is not pretty (ya ya I know everyone is beautiful). But if we think about it superficially she is not the pretty type. But I'm very impressed and happy that they can improve her looks so much with this hair and make up. Definitely a girl crush look and won my female heart instantly!! I prefer this kind of girls style over "innocence".
STAN TALENT STAN SEVENTEEN AND LOONA	Damn those dislikessss
Katherine Rochester	I actually love this song and I’m only 30 seconds in.
EXO LOVE NCT & REDVELEVT Bride	they are the most beautiful girls that i have ever seen
j o	This is kpop power!!!! I love izone~~~!!!!
Chiibi Chan	Okay, here's what I thought while watching this mv.  First, after about a minute and half, I JUST REMEMBER THAT THERE'S THE CUTE NAKO HERE. So, I though that SHE REALLY NEEDS MORE LINE DISTRIBUTION. I'm not her fans, but I always smile brightly when I see her (yas, i just have a picture in my brain when she was performing Memory Fabricators - To reach you in Produce48). And then, after a minute after that (which I feel like dayss waiting to see Nako again *serious I'm not her fans), "THERE SHE IS". Again, I smile and was so immersed by her cute visual. MY GOD...  Then, about Minjoo, her gaze and expression looks different compared when she was performing for class evaluation for the 1st time. Good girl... You have more confidence now...  And... CHAEYOUNG. OO MY GOD. I would've so mad if she was not included in this girl group called IZONE>>which I don't prefer. Glad she's here. With her talent, SHE DESERVES IT. And, over all the dances moves in this mv, I think it's normal if I say that when she's in the center dancing for the chorus, THAT'S THE BEST PART!!! Why? Of course because she's the best! But I remember again, she's also DOING A GOOD JOB IN SINGING. What you want more from her for being an idol?? She has it all. I want to hug her right now..  And, the girl I hope i'd have a child like her in the future, KWON EUNBI. So talented and beautiful, with her leadership skill up to the sky... Maybe, I'm considerate to be her fan... But not 100% yet... Actually I hope she would've in higher rank tbh. But I still glad that she's included in IZONE...  About other girls... I'm gonna talk about them later. This comment is long enough. Actually I'm a little bit dissappointed that some girls from PD48 (which i think is soo talented) was not choosen to be here. I hope they'll have more bright future by doing what they like & what make them happy..

Effy Blink	Arte :D
Yalie Racquel	i love how everyone was expecting this group/line up to be weak but they really went off with a strong debut. honestly, im quite surprised as well. following their journey from pd48, these ladies were more emphasized in terms of beauty which is why everyone was quick to downplay or doubt their abilities. good for them, i hope the team and producers behind izone continues to build them with more amazing songs and content. having a strong debut is one thing while continuity and consistency is another. also, chaeyeon is stunning 💕
Christy	They all look soooo good congrats, dear!!! 😭💕

xbandable	I love how everyone, when the final episode aired, kept saying that IZ*ONE was going to flop and that no one was going to stan because their line up "sucked"... here we are, with their debut music video 99% going to break the record for most viewed debut music video in 24 hours. Where are all the 'IZ*ONE IS GONNA FLOP' people now? LMAO
Chimmy's Yellow Hoodie	I'M SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU GUYS. This is a perfect debut song, not like the other mainstream girl group song, it has it own taste but catchy too. I think it will linger on my mind. The mv is  so perfect, they all got perfect screen time and line distribution. I'm looking forward for the next surprise from them. The visuals tho, I don't even know where to look. But Chaeyeon tho, damnnn gurll

A 파이브 G	어려운 수학공식 같은 곡이네요. 기존 중독성 강한 Kpop의 색깔을 조금 탈피한 상당히 세련된 느낌. 국내보다 국외에서 더 반응 좋을 듯.. 10번 재생후 느낌 잘 만들었다. 차트에 오래 남아있겠다. 안무짜기 힘들었겠다. 연습기간을 조금만 더 가졌더라면 더 완벽하지 않았을까..등등

Lara Tizatto	I still can not accept that the kaeun is not here, and that instead of sakura being the center, it is wonyoung. Like...wtf. It'll be a little hard support this group. The produce 48 disappointed us a lot :'(

_nvymx	The song was a hit for me! Sort of reminded me of a barbie song, oddly enough lol.  Wonyoung was a grade A center, and I'm so happy seeing Chaeyeon shine! She really outdid herself. I'm not sure how I feel about Yena (who's always proved herself to be a good vocalist) be shoehorned into a rapper, or Eunbi, doesn't give me main vocal feels, but they both did well. Chaewon is a princess, as always.

Franky Kho	KEEP STREAMING WIZ*ONE!!🌹
ian dwiki	Honestly. I thought it would be messy. Theres 12 members, it would be difficult to blend all them in. And look at this. Theres so many transitions, and you can feel the song suddenly tap into each of their parts, distinctively. And.. Well.. Honestly these girls are amazing. Most of them already has their own vocal character.. And the song transition right into the character. It doesnt look like it but surely this is such an interesting song. Unique id say

Kamila Rahmania	Wannaone😭
NAN HEE JANG	따분하다. 오디션 인기순으로 나열해서 뽑는게 능사가 아니라는 것을 보여준다. 오디션 프로그램 챙겨보던 팬들 대상으로 단기적으로는 성과가 나와도 처음보는 사람들을 팬으로써 신규 진입 시킬 매력이 부족한 친구들이 많아 보인다. 안유진 정도는 아이돌로서 물건이다.
ZLY/GsD/BLKPINK kdrma/kpop	I wonder if ever sakura's fancam during p48 ddnt pop up on my reccommendation list...Im still stock on the toilet..lol Glad that I have tried to watch that..and I ended up watching p48  and rooting for a girl...and ended up stanning these group now.... Congratulations on your debut🤗🤗🤗I really love the song...they are all so pretty and suits the song well.... Goodluck to your future, ❤❤💗💙💚💞💟 Its already 49 on trending here in singapore

Alberto Carrillo	Although I like the song so much and that I hate Wonyoung, I couldn't stop thinking that they used the "la vie en rose" quote wrong, lol. The quote refers to the color, no to the flower itself. Anyways, this song is so good.

Gabito	Sakura♥
Glaine Freyer	I still don't understand why people insisted to put Wonyoung as main center and the face of IZ*ONE. Sure, she's pretty and cute. But that's it. She lacks expression and stage presence compared to Sakura and other powerful members like Eunbi, Yujin or Yena. She's too young, immature and unexperienced. Imho, put a such maknae as main center is a wrong choice cause it will surpress and disrespect other member's talent. Sure she will improve as the group grows (she must improves!). But the true potential of IZ*ONE could only be reached by put charismatic and powerful member as its face.
Kriswandi Licious	Omg.. this song is so goood!! Hope they gain lot of popularity!!

C.S.J	아오~ 긴장타고있던 타 걸그룹들 긴장해제했을듯.내가...기대가 너무 컸나......10번20번 보고듣고 반복재생중인데 뭔가 착 감겨오는 맛이없는듯. 뭔가 겉돌아;;;; 멤버 이쁘고 개성있고 노래도 다 잘하는 편이라 생각하는데 곡이 좀 아쉬운 느낌?.....  루머 랑 비슷한 느낌도 드는데 루머같은 중독성도 없고.  예전에 누가 했던 말을 빌리자면~ 이정도의 좋은멤버로 이것뿐이 못하나?  딱 그생각듦. 아쉬움보다 더 큰 아까움.

bj kwon	들인 돈과 노력에 비해 살짝 아쉽지만 그래도 뮤비 퀄러티는 대박이고 노래도 애쓴티가 많이 남. 근데 프로듀스 주제가 3연타로 대박인데 왜 데뷔곡은 그만한 퀄러티가 안날까? 루머보다 낫다고는 못하겠지만 그래도 애를 많이 쓴 괜찮은 곡인것 같아 만족. 다음엔 박진영에게 곡을 받아보는게 어떨까? 넘어 넘어 넘어 같은 곡을 다시 줄지도.

Efelyn Onisiforus	I just want to say "it's a good thing yuri didn't make her debut in previous survival program', no offense, she's just too be talented with such pure vocal, it would be such a waste if she's joined... (you know what I mean if you keep on track on mnet's survival programs)😥 this group looks so exclusive because every one of them has the quality (appearance and talents),😍 And moreover, throughout the survival program we can see their true characters which is the plus point of this group, because we 'knew' them before they make their debut😀😁 Looking forward for the uncountable awards for this group😙😘😚IZONE Fighting!!!

_탄달	와 노래 잘 뽑았다
hugo	im gonna be honest with you: i was so mad that miru, chowon, gaeun and the others didn't make it into the final top, so i was kinda hesitant to immediately stan them. i watched all the produce seasons and the 48 one was the one where i really got deeply into it.  but man... this song slaps, it's so good. even tho ill always be bitter about my picks not being able to make it, i think ill stan izone. gl with promotions! ❤️ p.s.: chaeyeon looks so good and minju... she just has excellent genes lmao

spmijdr k	아이즈원 사장은 손익 분기점이 넘지 않아도 jyp나,  yg처럼 투자라고  생각하고 정산을 해줘야한다.   정산은 회사가 7,  가수가 3이 적당하다고 보는데  가수들에게 좀더 줄수 있으면  최대한 더 줘야한다.  또한 회사수입 7에서  회사와,  가수 들에게 들어가는 모든 비용을 써야한다.  요즘 많은 기획사들이 손익 분기점을  넘지 않았다는 이유로 몇년째 정산을 안해주는 기획사들이 많은데  아이즈원 기획사는  절대로 그래서는 안되고 jyp나 yg처럼 투자라고 생각하고 손익 분기점을 넘지 않았어도 회사7,   가수3의 비유로 정산을 해줘야 한다.   나는 통일이 되면 반드시 정치인이 되어서  정산을 제대로 안해준 기회사 사장들을 잡아들여서  그 가족과  함께 죽일것이다.    내말을 비웃겠지만  내 말을  절대로  명심해야한다.!!
Dhea Putri	Jujur aku suka sih smua girlgroup tapi aku cuma stan di boygroup. Dan IZ*ONE adalah girlgroup pertama yang aku jadi stan di dlm nya.

Sallie Andrea	I love it!!’
소피아Sophia	나 아이즈원 진짜 별로라고 생각했는데 방금 뮤비처음보고 충격이었음.  처음에 장원영이  뒤돌아봐서 조용히 뭔가 진행되나...?했는데 갑자기 화면 빡 바뀌고 대형이랑 안무가 소름돋았음.  이상한 곡일 줄 알았는데 프로듀스 3번의 데뷔곡 중 최고인듯? 갑작스러운 카메라씬 전환과 빠른템포에 놀라서 초반부에 집중되고, 사람많음을 잘 이용한 모양만드는 듯한 안무 (마치 초등학교 학예회나 무용에서 자주 쓰이는 부채춤에서 모양만들고 돌리는거. )로 소름끼침. 그리고 4분가까이 되는 뮤비 끝까지 그냥 보는거 굉장히 힘들어하고, 에너제틱이든 드림걸즈든 다른 연습생투표방식이 아닌 정식아이돌 노래도 항상 듣다가 1분도 채 되지않고, 바? 보면서 몇분남았나 확인하는데 순식간에 노래가 끝남. 엥? 뭔 노래가 1분인가?햇는데 4분이엇음 ㄷㄷ 여튼 칭찬임. 장원영이라는애는 몸짓하나하나가 좋은듯? 정말 가장 못생길 나이 중학생인데 저 정도에 비율은 할말없이 완벽하고 그냥 외모만 괜찮은느낌인가 했는데 도입부보고 천상아이돌인거 느낌.

catherine lal	So like is this another one of I.O.I ?

원스IV	roty is here
유환성	신곡 별로 + 사람 너무많음..
CG Asya	I thought their debut will be a cute concept
Leila152	Many are upset about wonyoung being the center but she is really then typical center that kpop girl groups have and need. I see similarities of WonYoung to Yoona, Nayeon, Irene, Sulli, Suzy. She stabilizes the group with her clean visuals and dance.
서울운수	아이즈원의 데뷔를 진심으로 축하합니다!!
YENNIE YEN	강혜원 감사합니다. 너는 최소한의 스크린 시간을 가졌어. 더 많이 표시되면 그룹이 망가질 것입니다.

Mifta Hul96	dance its so on point!! great debut Iz*One
iZee	Edith Piaf is quaking
Linh Able	Cày
아카시아	좋긴한데 신곡인데도 불구하고 너무 익숙한 멜로디가 신박하진 않다. 대박은 모르겠고 중박정도 하고 말것 같다. 실력들이 출중한  멤버들이라서,좀더 좋은곡을 기대했는데, 포로듀싱이 못받쳐주나?  내 욕심이었나 보다... 다른곡도 기대해 봅니다.
Sam Koncevich	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhOzauDRhFM
Keichan Zel	CHAEYEON IS SO BEAUTIFUL HECCKKKK I'M SCREAMING AND HER VOICE AND HER DANCING GOD SHE'S LITERALLY *The Perfect Woman* <3 <3 <3 HIICHAAAAN ALSO DID GREAT AND SHE'S SO PRETTY AAGHGH i mean i never expected cute chubby cheeks hiichan to pull off a concept like this but she has now proven with this and no way man that she can pull ANY concept off! also i love how whoever made the line distributions gave her lines that actually suit her voice and makes the song more aesthetically pleasing to hear <3

COCO OCOC	🌸🌸The ultimate IZ*ONE nanana💙💚💛
하루노	노래 좋다~개인적으로는 아이오아이 데뷔곡인 너무너무너무보다 내 취향. 노래 파트분배는 어느정도 잘 되어 있는것 같고, 일본멤버는 아직까지 노래파트 주기 보다는 임팩트있는 부분들을 준것 같다. 뮤비도 예쁘게 나왔고. 만족!
Lan Nguyen	#IZ*ONE
Tunv Tgbjj	#izon
김민지	사실 한번듣고 좋다고 하기엔 그다지 임팩트는 없는듯 (내 개인적인 의견)근데 또 듣다보면 좋아지겠지???요즘 노래 대부분 그러니깐 쨌든 뮤비색감도 미모도 이쁘긴 이쁘다

Tuankhai Vương	Why Jang won young looks so insipid? Because she looks like many other Korean idols, doesn't have her own appearance and character. She is similar to other Korean girls in this group, so it is not impressing. Her affected manners and her smile make me feel tired, not cute.

Mini Minami	With how popular izone is, and this above average debut song, they just knocked off idle and loona from roty award race.
원빈	역시 예상했던 대로 많이 구리다. 작은 기획사들은 곡을 못 받아서 문제야. 트와의 dance the night away 나 블핑의 두두두 처럼 확 꽂히는 게 없어.  후크도 없고..  올드하다.  북유럽 작곡가들이 페이가 많이 비싸긴 한가보네..

Bangtan Princess	WOW 😱😱😱😱😱😱
littlegreengoo	Bear in mind that this is my (unpopular) opinion.  Love this song but I had hoped that their debut song would be stronger than this to catch the public’s attention. It seems a little too common. Perhaps a good song for a second or so release once they have the public’s eyes on them. I really do hope they do as well as IOI and Wanna One. This’ll be a booster for their future career. Keeping an eye on them!
773nanu	다 좋은데 사쿠라 옷만 좀 어떻게... 왜 혼자 AKB 의상 느낌이 나죠? 나쁘단게 아니라 조화를 좀 맞춰줬음 좋겠다... 안좋게 튀네요 ㅠ

jimín	*TO ANY1 WHO WANTS TO STAN OR GET TO KNOW IZONE*   0:05 - the center is wonyoung  0:16 - the one with the veil is minju 0:24 - short hair is sakura, a part of the j-line 0:31 - the one singing is chaewon 0:37 - that's hitomi, you'll recognize her voice  0:42 - hyewon is the one the couch  0:46 - that's eunbi, she'll most likely be the leader 0:55 - that would be yuri, prob a lead vocalist 1:14 - chaeyeon in the center bc she's the main dancer  1:28 - the current rapper would be yena 1:37 - our beagle visual, yujin  1:44 - cute shortie, nako, will recognize her voice along with hitomi  JAPANESE MEMBERS ; - Nako - Hitomi  - Sakura  KOREAN MEMBERS ;  - Wonyoung - Yuri  - Chaewon - Yujin - Yena - Minju - Hyewon - Eunbi  - Chaeyeon    i hope this helps !

This group is eye catching for anyone. I’m looking at the numbers and obviously I’m not the only one who LOVED what they witnessed. I love it when a kpop group comes out of no where to blow my mind 🤘👏🔥I’m totally watching it again.

한민주	나코 예뻐ㅠㅠ
얍얍 얍얍	와 진짜 다들 너무 예쁘다... 제 인생에서 아이돌 덕질은 없을 줄 알았는데 이렇게 하게 되다니ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 유리 목소리가 그렇게 취향은 아니었는데 이 곡에선 진짜 유리 목소리가 너무 매력적이라서 참 좋다!! 채연이는 항상 잘했으니 더 할 말이 없고 혜원이는 아직 실력이 조금 부족한 건지 파트가 별로 없는 게 느껴진다. 다음 앨범에서는 더 좋은 모습으로 볼 수 있길! 그리고 채원이 목소리도 통통 튀는 느낌이라 몽환적인 이 곡에 어울릴까 걱정했는데 너무 잘 어울리고... 라비앙 로즈 굉장히 좋은 것 같다! 최고!!! 아이즈원 데뷔 축하하고 계속 응원할게요! 파이팅!!
東瀬千奈	Does this singing part have nothing to do with the ranking? Why are there no shots in the high rankings, especially the Japanese！！！
황선호	채연,나코,민주 순으로 굿~~^^
ongongongongong	ok THIS SLAPS
JasMin Lady	I admit that during the announcement of final line up im really against the winners cuz there's a lot of much deserving trainees did not make it and chaeyeon almost did not debut, but now when i look at them together everthing is perfectly balance, their vocals are amazing still waiting for their live performance, i can really feel their success in the coming months look at those visuals. Good thing that their debut song is not cutie cutie song😂😍

PUGI Prinnity	노래로 끌리는 부분이 조금이지만 비주얼 만큼은 정말 끝내준다.
춤추는동그랑땡	와 잠만 노래 개좋고 파트분배 몇명빼고 적절해서 놀람;;; 장원영은 1등으로 뽑혔으니까 파트 많은거 당연한거고 다른멤버들도 막 심각하게 적진 않은듯.강혜원은 아직 잘 못해서 파트 적게준거같고 나코는 파트 왜이리 없는지 이해가 안되지만....;;

ᆞ내 심장의 색깔은 black	프듀48 안 본 머글입장에서 최근에 본 신인 중에서는 안무나 노래 컨셉등 가장 고퀄인 듯 한데 하나 아쉬운거는 어쩔 수 없는거지만 파트분배가 좀 아쉽네 그래도 생각보다 보컬이 탄탄해서 놀램
화이트레드	혜원이가 랩해도 좋을것 같은데 갑자기 예나가 랩이라니..아니면 나눠서 파트주지 혜원이 파트가 별로 없어... 그래도 곡 좋고 랩 잘하는건 뭐지?

holyroseanne	tbh I feel like IOI is better as an overall group in terms of members and chemistry but IZ*ONE has better songs based off this debut
아미{에이틴}&도하%	이번 미니앨범에서 민주랑은비가어울리는듯 민주는 은근 뮤비색감?이 찰떡인듯 은비는 목소리가 시원시원해서 듣기좋은건 사실인듯 근데 난 사쿠라가최애라 더 눈길많이갈줄알았는데  확실히 한번 첫인상이 좋으면 계속 눈길가는게 사실인듯
seraphinite	in this MV, Minju and Sakura stood out to me the most 😍
TaeTen Jaeno	The japanese members korean is goo
Simon Rafael	Hyewon and yena rap so litt 🔥
리카	Visual overload 😱😍
이영진	ㅇㅇㅣ ㅜ  ㄱ..?
Netjak	Pretty good debut song. The girls actually really killed it which tbh I was slightly worried about how they would mesh together. If anything the weakest parts of this debut are some of the production choices on the song (those are pretty subjective) and perhaps the J-line could have used a bit more screen time maybe one more line, but even then the line distribution is much better than some groups. I have to say that this at least gets me to want to watch the live stage and check out the rest of the album. Good start and hopefully more good stuff to come.
Hana Official	Please 2M

Joo Hur	이 노래면 폭망인데;;;;;  장원영 기럭지 돋보이고. 안유리 개성 돋보이고.  얘네가 걸크러쉬로 가야 하는애들인가?   뛰어난 애들 뽑아 놓고 이런 노래라니...  작곡가 너무 돈 욕심이 컸던거 아냐? 이노래를 히트 시키려고 했다니;;; 완전 폭망. 프로듀스 48의 이미지랑 인기가 금새 없어질 듯.  트와이스 비디오 3개랑만 놓고 비교해도 너무 차이가 나게 끌어들이는 맛이 덜하네 ....   어떻게 하냐;;;;   이 능력있고 뛰어난 애들이 아깝다;;;
Army of Elodyye	I love it! I love their french accents x)

Red Bean	Congrats on debuting!! pretty sure they will do really well :D  IZ*ONE FIGHTING!!
김Boing	개인적 느낌은, 뮤비 좋고 예쁜 얼굴들도 잘 살렸고.. 근데 데뷔곡치고는.. 중견돌의 3집 앨범 느낌이랄까..  입에 감기는 포인트 멜로디는 '라라라 라비앙로즈'뿐인데 좀 단조롭고.. 그 건조한 레드가 사쿠라와는 정말 잘 어울리는 느낌. 역시 사쿠라는 마스크와 분위기에서 갑.. 아이즈원, 갈 길 멀고 할 노래도 많다. 흥해라 응원한다.
정현종	한국인이신분 이번 뮤비 평좀해주세요
xxyoung baexx official	Just support IZ.one ❤

J-hoppa ,	French for their debut...why do I feel proud as a french speaker ? 😅💕 All my support to IZ*ONE 💕
JYP Nation Talent	i love izone but i dont get the concept 😰 it is supposed to be sexy or girl crush or cutie? the melody and the dance is a bit sexy and mysterious, but some of them dance like that with bright smile, especially wonyoung. but she is pretty with ponytail tho.  chae, eunbi, did good job with their facial expression. others atleast smirk and why some even smile brightly. 😂😂😂 🤔 sorry izone.  nako voice didnt sounds like nako for me. surprisingly hyewon did better than my expectation.   yena rap(?) sounds good and her transition expression between concept is smooth too. minju always gorgeous. she is suitable with warm tone. it makes her looks prettier.  hope they got catchier song for comeback. i got dissapointed with abstract concept for IOI debut song too. but well fed with their next release 😂😂👍

Otherwise, the song ""No way man"" gained 3.1 million hit rate within 3 days.  Hope it could get some  help for IZ ONE due to the japanese line.

Linh Khánh	Kim Chae Won high note <<33333
Oribā Heizu	This was the perfect debut for them imo, like actually amazing, the concept was like a mild sexy and mature Eunbi really suited this song, and her vocals slay Sakura despite not having many lines, really rocked her little bits and her visual shots ❤️❤️❤️ Chaeyeon looked absolutely amazing, honestly would’ve assumed she’s the visual and she looked and sounded amazing Hyewon’s miny lines suited to song a LOT and it fitted well Yena’s Rap was amazing and her voice really sounded get and unique Nako’s first bit was cute but her second bit SLAYED, it didn’t sound like her at all!! Wonyoung did better at Center than I thought but yeah Chaewon really deserved the lines she got, the song suited her, and she looked amazing, despite not noticing her at all in the show I’ll pay attention to her from now on Hiitomi really suited the choreo and is clearly a great dancer despite not being in the Center Yuri’s voice sounds really mature for her age, kinda like Jihyo from Twice and I love those kinds of voices Yujin really blended the song together, despite not having  a ‘killer’ part she really helped pull the song together Minju’s voice was better than I remember! It’s great

Houseofmask Mask	Eunbi really looks like Irene 😂
가제트형사	약하다. 임팩트가 없다. 차라리 30명   있을 때 경연곡들이 훨씬 좋은 듯.. 데뷰곡이 경연곡들 보다 못한 것은 확실한 것 같다. 최종 경연곡 2곡 중 일본어곡이 이 곡보다 얘네들한테 훨씬 잘 어울린다. 루머, 너에게 닿기를, 1000퍼센트, 롤리롤리 이런 곡들이 얘네들한테 더 잘 어울린다.

jihyo looks like a melon	minjoo my love i love you
Jaejung Kim	어렵다. 제목이 장미빛 인생인 것을 생각하면서 노래를 들어도 의도하는 것이 무엇인지 어렵다. 첫 컨셉으로 청순도 아니고 섹쉬도 아닌 어중간한 중간을 선택했고 음악도 그런 의도에 맞게 정한 것 같다. 중간정도 성적 나오면 성공일 듯.
igvj ok	아이즈원 팬이라 데뷔날 엄청 기다렸는데 이건 뭐.. 솔직히 매력을 모르겠다 ㅜ 타팬도 입덕할 수준으로 만들어줘야지 이건 기존 팬도 무덤덤한 수준이잖아 ㅠ 노래도 뭔가 임팩없고 안무도 ㅜ ㅜ 좀 더 신경써주지 ㅜ 뭔가 좀 안타깝네 ㅜ

Ollie Nguyenka	This group will be really noticeable because this group is a mix of interesting girls. Japanese girls in kpop group for the first time (not first time.. but like... its cool to have somebody who is japanese) then we have CheaYeon who was in Kpop star and was on the Jyp show Sixteen. Yuri was on idol school show, Kim Min joo was in a lot of Mvs and kdramas and has already collaborate with a singer (i dont remember her name xd). Ahn YuJin is famous thanks to the lens and WonYoung is famous because of her innocent looks and her pretty face and also her cute expressions on stages. Eun Bi has already debuted but i think on Izone she'll get more success. HyeWon, ChaeWon are just pretty. I luv them all, but i think.. that every gurl from this group has a diff vibe and it doesn't suit everybody, but this is a good start, luv youu <33

Ferry Afrizalv	what people think about monster rookies now a days?  Fromis_9 = Idol School, Gyuri G(idle) = Cube Entertainment, Soyeon LOONA = their loonaverse, Heejin IZ*ONE = Produce 48, AKB48, Sakura.  cmiiw
Didin Saepudin	NakoChann kawaii

TWICE! YES or YES?	So from this song. I can (maybe) assume their roles in their group. Obviously, *Yuri* is the *Main Vocal* . (I mean her vocal tho). But I'm a little bit confused, it's either *Eunbi* is also a *Main Vocal* or maybe she's a *Lead Vocal* along *Chaewon and Chaeyeon* (whom I assume they're also lead vocals). I think *Yena* is the *Main Rapper* of the group, along side *Hyewon* who is a *Lead Rapper* . And for the *other members* I think they'll only be *Vocalists* .  IZ*ONE Member Roles : Jo Yuri — Main Vocal Kwon Eunbi — Main/Lead Vocal, (Sub-rap), Main Dancer Lee Chaeyeon — Lead Vocal, Main Dancer Choi Yena — Main Rap, (Vocalist), Lead Dancer Jang Wonyoung — Center, Vocalist An Yujin — Vocalist, (maybe sub-rap?), (Might be on dance line) Kim Chaewon — Lead Vocal Miyawaki Sakura — Face of the Group, Vocalist Kim Minju — Vocalist, Lead Dancer Yabuki Nako — Vocalist, (Might be on dance line) Honda Hitomi — Vocalist, Lead Dancer Kang Hyewon — Lead Rap, Sub-vocal/Vocalist  Ps. Only my opinion, this might not be accurate.
Lakser	Omg she went from fortnite gamer to this ❤️
yenny wien	Yuri voice really suits with this song and iconic 😍

Mondenglanz || Mirin	There's a maid café in Akibahara, Tokyo, named La Vie en Rose (my favourite japanese voice actress Kusuda Aina used to work there). It makes me soft that IZ*ONE named their debut song La Vie en Rose. Congrats on your debut IZ*ONE, HWAITING 💜

Pornesian Parapio	I see how mnet now fucks up. Lyk wtf is wrong with Sakura's lines and screen time? Is this what she gets for ranking two??? MGA HUNGHANG. The other rank 6+ members have more exposure than her, not to feel biased but for f's sake, she gets robbed again???

빈칸	귀를 끄는 캐치가 부족한듯 한데...그냥 무난한 걸그룹 노래인 듯. 컨셉 좀 안 어울리는 애들도 있고... 프듀48자체가 이전 시즌들 만큼의 집중을 끌진 못했으니 음원성적은 봐야알듯

army bts	แชยอนสวยมากอ่ะ
소낙Sonak	로즈라는 컨셉 자체는 신선하고 좋은데... 뭔가 애들한테 안 맞는 느낌이다..ㅠㅠㅜ 그냥 통통튀는 귀여운 컨셉 해도 좋았을 거 같은데 그러면 트와이스랑 겹칠까봐 소속사가 머리 좀 굴린건가,, 뭐 아이오아이나 워너원처럼 같은 컨셉 쭉 밀고 나가진 않을거 같으니 다행이지만, 데뷔곡이란게 참 중요한데 데뷔일도 그렇고 노래의 임팩트가 없는건 확실히 좀 아쉽다
Rendang is my fav	Wonyoung is center here but mostly people comments about Sakura.. Lol I'm not Sakura fan, she's rank 2nd but her screen time is little she need more
김은경	뮤비 카메라워크와 편집이 너무 밋밋하고 뻔해요 들어갔다나왔다  개인컷 또 반복  배경도 반복 천도 다림질 제대로 안되고 아쉽넹

puppet too	I really do love this song and I’m excited for their journey, but it’s just totally reminding me that our time with Wanna One is really coming to an end. I’m honestly kinda upset the girls debuted while Wanna One hasn’t disbanded yet? It’s like the world is saying “yes Wanna One is soon to be disbanded, here’s their replacement” I wish that the debut happened next year so it’ll hurt less...

Hana Nj.	Totally not expecting this.... Honestly the teaser picture didn't convinced me that much, I thought it be those cliche cutesy concept, not like there's anything wrong with those, but it ended up really edgy which I really like. Overall I'm impressed. Also Yena raps, reminded me again why I was deeply rooting for her 💕
DarkRonier	심하다;;; 나름 화제를 모아서 데뷔한 걸그룹인데 이정도로 가난한 뮤직비디오일줄은....  이건 머 거의 국내 C급 걸그룹 뮤비수준인데...  일본쪽에서는 전혀 투자를 못받는건가?? 뮤직비디오 하나만 잘만들어도 국제적인 스타가될수있는 세상인데 대체 기획사는 뭘하는건지....  돈을 아낄데서 아껴야지 뮤비에서 아끼는건 최악의수인데....   아아 맞다 기획사다 다 서로다른 아이돌이었지;

Samantha Sartoruis	CHAYEONNNNN IS SOOOOOO PRETTYYY💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Moonang P	Ok, regardless of the quality of the song & MV, (which personally does not quite match my standards) the worst which I've feared became a reality: JP members got relatively poor distribution in lines. I don't know why the company made that choice, maybe because JP members are not familiar with Korean lyrics; regardless, they should have given them more lines & screentime. It's IZ*ONE's DEBUT SONG, which means they have to show their (potential) fans that they're supporting all the girls. Or the JP line fans will naturally think of the worst- that the company is just using JP girls for JP core fan's attention. They should have at LEAST given Sakura, the 2nd place, more lines & screentime. Bad, bad move.
CC Chan	If you watch produce48 since the beginning, you would feel so proud of the j-line. Omg they all slay in this mv 😭

yanni11209	Idk how to feel about this. I was very bitter about the line up but decided to give them a chance. I feel like the concept is eh? I suits some (eunbi, minju, charyeon) but not others. Idk maybe the song will grown on me from the live stages. I’m 50/50. It’s not bad but I’m not stanning yet.

Yesenia Nazareth	OMG Sakura 😍😍
사자어드	음악성이나 컨셉은 잘 잡힌거 같은데.. 확실히 일본 멤버들의 분량이 거의 안나오네요..  타이틀 곡이라면 전 맴버 모두에게 동등히 분량을 주는게 맞지 않았을까하는 아쉬움이....
안하연	1:37 2:20 3:07
sh kang	데뷔곡이 어떻게 경연곡 보다 후지노? 전내 흔한 행사용 c급 아이돌 노래 같다.

bloweden le gal	That moment when u r french and instantly click bc u saw "la vie en rose" . Great visuals and song btw
Paul Jang	To be honest, the song is not popular! It is awkward and too common. I expect more impressive stuff but it is not.

Caticorn K	They are seriously to many members but I still love them ❤️
최철원	왠만하면 댓글 달지 않는데 왜 이맴버를 일회용으로 만드는지.. 프로젝트가 큰만큼 보여줘야지 이게 뭡니까? 이게 될꺼라고 이리 만드거예요? 어떤 생각으로 이리 만드신거죠? 한일합작에 크게 이슈가될 걸그룹 프로젝트인데 이 노래 누가 소장가치 있을까요? 프로듀스48 관심있게 보고 기대한 팬으로 실망감뿐만 아니라 화가 나네요. 차라리 "다시만나" 가 나아요. 롤리롤리 그것도 좋구요. 근데 이건머.. 큰프로젝트에 이게 뭡니까?
엉셰	노래가 생각보다 퀄이 좋아서 놀랐고 원영이는 어떻게 저렇게 계속 예뻐질까

HavoRanger	<3
한상현	개인적인 의견을 적자면, 최예나가 랩파트한 게 신의 한 수였다.(강혜원이나 사쿠라가 하는 것보다는 확실히 낫다.) 그리고 노래 자체는 나쁘지 않지만, 데뷔곡인데 12명의 매력을 골고루 보여주지 못한 느낌이 강했다. (장원영, 안유진, 권은비, 김채원, 조유리가 거의 다하는 느낌?) 그래서 이럴거면 12명이나 필요하나? 라는 생각이 들었다. 그리고 사쿠라, 나코, 히토미 파트는 특히 적은 것을 보니까 한일합작 하는 의미가 크게 없지 않았나라는 생각이 들었다.(아마 화제성이 전 시즌보다 떨어져서 노선을 바꾼 듯?) 그래도 춤은 이채연 파트 등 임팩트 있는 동작도 있고 괜찮은 편인 것 같다.
이지원	국민돌 가즈아!!
욜롤로인 싸 언 니 뚜 이	다맘에들지만 히토미랑 사쿠라,나코 분량 개 없어;; 다음 음원 냈을땐 사쿠라랑 나코,히토미 분량좀 챙겨줬으면 좋겠다

あおぞらよぞら	デビュー、おめでとう☺️🎊💗 これからまた、がんばって🐥💗
Lolita Park	Wonyoung expression kinda doesn't fit this concept. Like this concept is a mix of sexy, cute, and powerful but all her expression is just cute. Not that I hate her cause I just realize the song' vibe fits better when it was Minju, Eunbi, and Chaeyeon as center.
Mailys Zuber	Lalala vie en rose  Leurs accents sont tellement prononcés qu’on étend même pas quand elles disent "en"  Bref mais ça fais plaisir d’entendre du français dans la kpop 🤟☺️❤️

Poods Jeff	What a great debut song! THIS IS BOP     but fuck Mnet for rigging the last ranking episode. I would've 100% financially support them if it wasn't for the center. Yeah she's cute but damn her face is so boring to look at after a while.

k56 non	見るたびに思うけど、ビジュアルが強すぎる
김소정	데뷔곡이면 조금더 임팩트있고 중독성이라도 있지 않아야 돼지 않을까 저는 생각합니다. 안무도 딱히 뇌리에 박히는 것도 없구요... 호불호가ㅏ 갈린다면 저는 불호 쯔음 입니다. 이번에 역대급 컴백인데 이런노래로 1등을 할 수 있을까요..

*홍블리너스*	채연이 분량 많이없을까봐 걱정햇는데 다ㅐ행이야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 채연이 제일빛나 ❤️
Jake Shin	영상미의 색감이 도드라져 보여 좋긴한데 상위 멤버 중심인게 조금 아쉽긴 해도 멤버들 개개인를 최대한 돋보이게 잘 만든거 같네요. 노래는 약간 파괴적이진 않더라도 멜로디는 부드러운 듯 경쾌하고 차분한게 듣기 편해서 좋네요. 안무도 잘 어울리고.. 얼마전 나온 AKB 'No Way Man' 이랑 비교 해보면... ㅎㅎㅎ 엄청난 차이의 퀄리티를 느끼네요.  라비앙로즈 찍으면서 나서 사쿠라, 나코, 히토미 정말 AKB 뮤비 찍기  싫었겠다.

서현07	다 이쁘다♥
이먕	컨셉 신선하고 곡도 전체적으로 중독성있는 멜로디에 다이나믹도 잘 살렸다고 느꼈음. 내 예상보다 훨씬 좋아서 깜짝 놀랐는데... 여기 댓글 외국인들 반응도 다 기대했던것 이상으로 좋다고 하는데 한국인 몇몇 댓글ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 밑도끝도 없이 더 신경쓰라는 댓글은 솔직히 좀 웃김 ... 비판적인 의견 좋은데 신경쓰라는 말은 무슨...ㅠㅠ 누가보면 프로듀싱 해본 사람인줄...  아무튼 나는 이거 보고 아이즈원 팬 될듯... 다 너무 예쁘고 훅 파트 두명 다 음색 오져용❤️

Primafadhil Sulistyo	my opinion ♡_⊙ 1.Japanase Trainee looks very different, idk maybe it cauzd by their csuit or what but they look very fresh.. n i like it(especially sakura with her barrets lol) 2.Chaeyon... is that you? she's so pretty with thats hair(but not her hair colour).. yeah... iz*one dance machine is unbelieveble ¤ 3.Idk maybe this debut song is catchy,Especially at "lalalalavien rose" (Dont you think "lalala" word can get stucjed in our head >_< maybe like "pali lalalala" n "lalalalavienrose" )  Love from Indonesia ♡♥

p.듀콩	와우와우와우🤗
최우혁	나코 짱!
신수민	한국멤버들이 많기도 하고 일본 멤버들이 당연히 한국어 발음이 잘 안되는 건 맞는데 일본멥버들 파트가 너무 적고, 장원영, 김민주,이채연 밖에 뮤비에 안 보이는 것 같네요.. 메보인 유리도 잘 안보이고....
pimpim	คือสวยทุกคนเลยอ่ะะะะะะ ชอบบบบบ

mxchiibong	This is beyond my expectation. They literally slayed the concept, the song. Their vocals, their dance, their charisma. At first, I'm not interested in them, only watch like 3 eps of pd48 but when I listened to the highlight medley, I can't wait for this song, and I don't even know that this song was the title track. I'm glad they are better than I expected cause I need more of GGs, can't stop trashing over them eventho my ult group is BTS. You girls got my support! 💜 And is it bad that I want- I mean, need to see the live stage? Cause _oh my god, my hearteu.. my hearteu is oh my god_ 🔥🔥

재횬재횬	내 고정픽 다 떨어지고 채원이만 남았는데 데뷔후에는 안유진만 좋아하게 되네., 노래는 좋은데 멤버 전체를 봤을때는 약간 안오울리는듯,,, 밝은것만 하길..., 너무 레드레드 유혹적.. 살아남을수 있을지.,,

남백승호	컨셉을 잘못잡은것  아냐   라비앙 로즈  듣기좀 그렇네   어떻게보면  좋은것 같기도 하고워너원 보다는  조금임팩트가약하다   그리고  일본애들은 가려지고  완전히  한국애들만다눈에 띄니   오늘 데뷔니  쭉 시켜보겟지만  글쎄  해외에서  좋아할까  현재 BTS가 대세인데   아무리 한일 합작이라고 해도  사쿠라 와 나코  히토미 는 전혀 분량이 없네   일본오타쿠들 이거보고  안나오면  지랄거리는것 아냐사쿠라가  안보인다고  나코  히토미  도   분량좀주지

ミ빔슬련-죄송해요-	호불호가 갈릴거 같고 잘하는 멤버가 뭍히고 비주얼쪽으로만 고르는거 같음 솔직히 데뷔 곡인데 좀 신경을 더 써야될거 같다 프로듀스 48이 잘못된게  실력이 아니고 사람들이 외모로 거의 뽑기 때문에 실망인 곡ㅇㅣ다 다음곡에는 실력이 높은 사람을 파트를 많이 주자 워너원 뷰티풀 같이 다니엘만 파트 많이 준게 잘못된 일과 같은 상황이 겹치지 않도록 하자

Hwang Eun Bi	This is soooooo goodddddd
키몽이	프로듀스 안보고 이 뮤비보고 느낀 점은.. 그냥 에이스 여기서도 몇명 추릴 수 있을거 같은데ㅋㅋㅋ 굳이 12명?까지 뽑아야하나 어차피 노랜 기계음이고 걍 예쁜애들 6명 정도로 나왔음 훨씬 뜰텐데
betty boop	I love IZ*ONE❤
쁨여니 '	와 진짜 유리 넘후 이뽀♡♡ 조율 홧틩!!♡
Dobi dobido	예능이다 뭐다 돈이 많이 들어가긴 하나보다. 중요한 첫뮤직비디오인데 이렇게 저예산으로 찍을줄은 몰랐네.. 맴버들도 평상시보다 매력을 잘 잡지 못한 것같고.. 내가 눈이 너무 높아진건가.. 뭔가 전체적으로 부족해. 편집,예산,킬링파트... 다부족해.. 뮤비 컬러감도 많이 떨어지고, 가끔 맴버들 옷 자세히 보면 엄청 갸우뚱해지는 부분들이 있음. 뮤비는 패션, 컬러감,킬링포인트,예산이 충분히 들어가야 재미있는데..
Martin Vu	Damn this is such a different vibe. I love this concept 💙💙
dugongo arcobaleno	EUNBIIIII
jenny kim	예술적으로는 노래가 편안하고 좋은거 같다,, 후크송이 잘 뜨긴 하지만

Pammy Park	OMGGG mAh baby luvs! Aaaaahhh their debut song is so beautiful omo! 😫💛💛💛
워찌	개인적으로 프듀때는 별로였는데 권은비 진짜 컨셉이랑 가창력은 좋은거같음... 이번 곡에서 제일 잘어울리는듯ㅇㅇ

Yasi 08	I didnt expect this kind of concept from them but  I'm glad they did. The song is unexpectedly catchy as well. Great debut.  Ps. My fave part is the outro dance break with naku and sakura.
KPOP TIME	Is this group temporary like I.o.I ?
nnnyl_spoo	SAKURA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
이유선	잘됐으면 좋겠는데 데뷔곡으론 생각보다 아쉬운듯 노래 자체로 치면 나쁘진 않은데 데뷔곡 타이틀로 대중들 한테 한번에 인식시키기엔 확 터질만한 부분이 없음 귀에 꽂히는 멜로디나 음원만 선방하면 이미 팬덤이 있어서 인기 터질거 같은데.. 잘돼라 얘들아 8ㅅ8
Nemo Chan	Chaeyeon  I love
[채은곤듀]나영팬	기다리고 기다리던 노래ㅜㅜㅜㅡㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ안나오는줄 알고 걱정했어요오우ㅜ

써에	솔직히 말하면 매우 실망함.. 안그래도 11월에 컴백 가수들 견제 엄청 해야하느라 좋은 곡 뽑아도 모자랄판에 레드는 무슨 다른 그룹 레드카펫 해줄려고 만든거같음 ㄹㅇ로... 첫 스타트 말아먹을거같은데...

pii's Emm	I do not expect this day too much would not expect this group debut I hated this group for debut debut failure without any trophy also expect the management company more concerned for WANNA ONE butt that there will be a reasonable link for Europe The company with WANNA ONE heard rumors that the company is labor exploitation of WANNA ONE to recapture the bridge request for debut debut failed to repeat again soon disbanded to hear music magically

Aa하요링복숭아	나는야 위즈원!!!
행복한비타민	밑에 댓글 보니까 '망했다', '노래가 밋밋하다','뮤비에 공을 들이지 않았다' 등등 안 좋은 평들이 많은데 저는 오히려  중독성 없어도 노래만 좋으면 계속듣게 되고 좋고, 뮤비도 저는 춤을 좋아하는 사람으로서 저랑 같은 춤 좋아하시는 분들은 오히려 더 좋아하실 수 있어요. 결국 자신의 취향의 문제죠. 그리고 저는 아이즈원 언니들이 무슨 노래를 들고오든 귀여운 컨셉을 하든, 청순 컨셉을 하든 제눈에는 다 예뻐보이네요. 11월 라인업이 최악임에도 좌절하지말고 끝까지 열심히 해주셨으면 좋겠어요. 💕아이즈원 데뷔 축하해요💕

탓티히	노래 생각보다 되게 좋네 오오
Sued X	Sakura ♥
me too	Ofc they used the japanese girls to get attention but now all they do is shove lackluster koreans down our throats. Chaewon and Chaeyeon who were last got more screentime than Sakura and Nako, 2nd and 6th place respectively. I did not expect any better though. Thumbs down, yet another disappointment.
Okta harmayani Astri	Chaeyeoun 💖💖
wnbfts	I see this MV heavily wants to make WonYoung to look like the center but I feel like Minjoo is the center.

정지영	데뷔곡보다 루머가 더 좋았었던건 기분탓이가....
웅냥얌냠공주	왜 끝날 땐 아이즈원을 강조하는 거야? 정말 구려 색 조합 괜찮으면 상관 없는데... 갑자기 핑크가 툭 나오는 거 보니까 개별로다. 다음 뮤비 땐 이렇게 하지 말아 주세요.

hazim rasyad	Its a BOP
김동욱	냉정하게 얘기하면.. 기다린 보람은 있는데.. 일단 곡 자체가 타이틀곡으로 하기엔.. 좀 아닌듯 함.. 파트분배는 어찌 했는지 모르겠는데 일본 친구들 분량이 너무 적음.. 노래만 놓고보면.. 나코 분량 너무 적은듯 싶고.. 이 아이들의 장점을 못 살린 곡인것 같음...

adeena6	This stumbled in my reccomend. I've never watched any of the produces  or cared for any of the groups. But I must say this might be one of my new fav produce songs. Oooffff it sounds good. That one who probably is main vocal, shes kills it!
Mun Army * Blink * Wannable	Tại nhóm này mà Wanna one bị đối xử bất công ! Còn chương trình wanna one go ko dc phát hành ! Công ty gần như ko quan tâm nhóm nữa vì lo quảng bá cho nhóm này ! Dù nhóm chưa tan tã thì công ty cũng đâu còn quang tâm 😏 CÔNG TY , CEO , QUẢNG LÝ !!!!! Mấy ông tha cho các anh nhà tôi đi !!! Thật bất công khi nhóm chưa tan rã đã bỏ bê nhóm !!! Wannable tụi tôi còn quang tâm nhóm hơn các ông nhiều ^^ còn các ông thì chỉ cần nhóm mới là bỏ nhóm cũ 😏   OK NẾU CÁC ÔNG ĐÃ BỎ BÊ CÁC ANH NHÀ TÔI THÌ TÔI KO CHẮC NHÓM NÀY SẼ ÍT ANTI NHA ☺️ chúc nhóm mà các ông cố gắng quảng bá sẽ ngày càng nhiều anti !!!! 😉😊☺️   Wanna one mãi là nhóm nhạc tuyệt vời trong lòng các wannable ko bao giờ thay thế dc ❤️❤️❤️

심서영	왜 싫어요가 이래 많아ㅠ
Vocalista Mik	I dont see something SPECIAL on the not like IOI  The song is too Cliche for a kpop song to think that its a debut song  THUMBS DOWN
Becca Chii	Amazing debut, everyone looks beautiful, the mv looks amazing, great choreo and I felt like they somehow managed to balance all the amazing vocalists so they all got lines and screentime. So glad Yena got the rap rather than Hyewon, although she was worried about it she totally nailed it ♡ I thought they'd end up with some super cutesy song like IOI but I am so glad they didn't! Worth the long wait since P48 and I'm excited to see what else they produce during their contract. 아이즈원 화이팅!
Jabami Yumeko	Galit ata stone music sa jap girls hahahaha

Mayu	IZ*ONE did not disappoint with their debut! I was salty at first, because almost none of my picks made the final line up, but IZ*ONE and each of the members are starting to grow on me. I wish them the best, and I wish them a successful debut!
Pナオヒコ	진짜 노래 드럽게 못뽑았네.  킬링파트가 전혀 없고 심심해서 듣다 졸 지경이다. 이 예쁜 애들 데려다가 진짜 뭐하는거냐. 스톤뮤직에서 프로듀싱함? 대표부터 말단까지 다 데려다가 줄빠따 때려야 됨 진짜

최미정	뻘건게 꼭 중국아이돌 뮤비같네. 트와이스나 블핑과 이정도로 경쟁이 되겠니?  택도없다고 생각되지만.  다른 신인걸그룹과도 안될것같네. 노래.  춤 둘다 중독성도 없고 임팩트도 없고. 비주얼은 몇명눈에 띄긴하지만 그정도 비주얼은 타그룹에도 꼭 한두명씩 있고.  트와이스나 블핑 비주얼과는 비교도 안되고 원영이는 좀 아깝다는 생각이 드네.

Proud of the maknae for getting to debut at such a young age! Great vocals, great song.. I'll keep an eye on them BTW, this is the first debut that I've seen of any group, meaning to say, I've known them since their debut. EDIT: I think my bias is Eunbi- her voice blew me away😍

Junguardo Nunez	Yujin fans ? ❤️ Army here to support IZONE ! I love them so much. I’ve been supporting since the show. ❤️
yoonsang song	춤 노래 무난하게 좋은편인데 뮤비가 좀 심심... 스토리가 없고 너무 댄스 위주... 좀더 고퀄로 만들었으면 좋았을것 같은데 아쉽 스토리버전과 댄스버전으로 분류해서 만들었었으면... 너무 어중간하게 공을 들인 느낌이 듬...

Toni Uy	CHAEYEON!!!
듀뿌유곤	제 생각에는 이번곡이 마음에 와닫는 부분이 없는것 같고 6명씩 나누어서팀을 만들어요 그럼 2팀이잖아요?1팀은 예를 들어 천사컨셉 다른 1팀은 악마컨셉이런거를 해서 합치면 좋을 것 같네요.쉽게 말해서 "반전"이죠.그럼 와 닫는 부분이 많을 것 같네요~! 이건 저의 개인적인 생각입니다.

푸른문	노래를 못하는 것도 아니고 춤을 못 추는 것도 아니고 랩을 못하는 것도 아닌데 왜 임팩트가 없지?
뀹 뀹	예나 랩 너무 잘해.. 진짜 미쳐 느낌 너무 좋아ㅠㅠㅠ 예나 랩 맨날 해죠 루머 랩 따라하는 것도 넘모 귀여웠는데ㅠㅠㅠ

*dubu*	I have a question: Why can't i search the MV? i need to click on links to watch this MV on YT.
kookie bae	Absolutely love pre chorus bit but very disappointed with supposed "drop". Could have gone harder? Idk. Still Stan tho🙌
ssoo Lee	너무 흔한 느낌 아니어서 좋기만 한데.... 들으면 들을수록 중독성도 있고... 롤린롤린 말은 좋지 그런 느낌 하면 얘들이 보컬이 쎈 애들만 모인것도 아닌데 높고 통통튀는 뭐 그런 노래하면 원래 목소리톤 높은 소수애들빼면 죄다 목소리 바꿔서 부르고 하면 진짜 실력반감돼서 들리고 특징없이 끝나지.

_승효	그전 프듀에서 했던 무대가 더 낫은거 같다,, 11월에 줄줄이 거대 그룹 나올텐데 여기는..
Nice Lindon	I barely see Nako! Please give her more lines!  Chaeyeon and Eunbi slayed! Go girls! Tough fight indeed!
만두군	아이즈원만의 느낌 나는 것 같은데? 임팩트는 없는 것 같지만 데뷔곡으로 괜찮은듯ㅋㅋ 왤케 혹평밖에 없냐ㅜㅜ
도로시dorothy	헐 노래 개좋다 기다린 보람 있는듯ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 라라라라비앙로즈 중독성 개쩐다 왜 다들 중독성 없다구 하지...? 나만 중독성 있나? 데뷔곡으로 딱 맞는 것 같은데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 다들 안 좋은 평가 안 했으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠㅠ

[냥냥이분들 사랑해요]menyangi메냥이	사쿠라 분량 넘 없는 듯..... 중독성도 별로 아이즈원 덕후로서 뮤비도 돈 별로 안 쓴거 같음...다음엔 뮤비에  돈 마니쓰시길.....
Marsha Aurellia	GA NGERTI LAGI INI MV BAGUS BANGET GILAA PARAHH AHH ;(
이요한	애들은 열일했는데 어른들은 그냥 놀았네 뮤비도 곡도 안무도 뮤비는 장비하나에 카메라 얻쳐서 그냥 막찍은거고 곡은 그냥 타이틀이 아니라 수록곡으로 해도 별로인듯

_[Roha]로하	노래랑 아이즈원은 좋은데 노래가 딱히 중독성이 없어서 끌리진 않아용ㅠㅠ
Stephanie Lee	노래는 나쁘지는 않은거 같은데 ... 대중적이진 못하네 ..그래도 비주얼에 힘 빡 준건 인정 ..다 이쁘네

아미성덕이되고픈	진짜 내 픽 중 고유진 장규리 언니빼고(ㅠㅠㅠ) 다 데뷔해서 좋다..근데 난 고유진 있는 루머를 진짜 보고 싶었는데.. 근데 다 예쁜다 진짜 노래도 나쁘진 않은데 시즌 1,2보단 파급력이 덜 한 듯 한일 합작이라 그런가? 근데 한국연습생들은 진짜 실력 대박이다 너무 예쁘잖아...난 뭐냐
서정룡	일본 우익 돈줄 대주는 회장놈이 일본 진출을 목적으로 만들었으니 당연히 일본 분위기에 좋은곡으로 선택 했을테고 일본 대뷔 목적으로 한 프로젝트니 일본애들 수준에 맞게 안무와노래를 만들었겠지 일본애들 이곡도 버거웠을테니 더한곡은 따라도 못왔을것이고 일본눈높이 마추면 된다고 봤거지 한국은 이미 사람들이 엄청실어하고

jones anne	오마이가 타이틀곡 되었어야된다. 분명히 씨제이 씹병신 직원새끼들 데리고 타이틀곡 투표로 정했을꺼다. 그러니 이렇게 두루무난하지만 꽂히는게 없는 좆망곡이 타이틀 되는거임

Julia Koshbaevna	More screen time to Hitomi
유리 ʟᴀ ᴠɪᴇ ᴇɴ ʀᴏsᴇ	the views so low... DON'T STOP STREAMING
Sihar Tobing	Lovely Dancing Girl : Nancy & Group - IZ-ONE - ( La Vie En Rose ) MV : Bigolive Show By - Stone Music, .... Bravo.
jeojang supremacist	PSA: YUJIN, EUNBI, CHAEYEO, YENA, AND MINJOO ARE THE DANCERS OF IZ*ONE. DON'T BE SALTY IF THEY'RE THE ONES LEADING THE CHOREO.
Cara Arissa Quidangen	I love ahn yujin and was happy that she got alot of part. But i hope they distributed the parts/screentime fairly. I was waiting for hitomi and can't even see her in this mv.
Joban Andrada	i wasn't planning on stanning them after produce48 but when i watched the teaser, it was hard not to stan. The song and choreo is just perfect!
Alliah Jane Gullem	EUNBI SARANGHAEEEEE
넌죽었따	이런 노래 밖에 없었나... 경연 때 쓰인 곡들과 비교해도 나은 게 없는듯. 차라리 경연 때 인기 좋은 곡으로 데뷔를 하던가. 춤도 너무 특색이 없고.. 뮤비는 진짜 한숨 나온다. 트와이스, 블랙핑크급 뮤비를 바란 것도 아닌데 이건 진짜..
Rosie MPG	I am okay...I screamed...but I am okay         💞💕💟💖❤😍😻😘💕💝💟💖💖❤😩💝💙💚💜💋❤💕💓💣💗💖💚💛💗❤💓💜💛💝💟
rock	Hitomi's voice is veryyyyy cute:)
Gabi	So proud of my Sakura 😭😭❤️😻😻😻😻😻
Giovanna G	It's a bop omg they look so beautiful
Racheal Mae Cutmaya	Visuals. 😍
Cassandra Adrianus	Wow. I used to see their face with average daily makeup in PD48. They're really pretty with full makeover in this MV.
등어	에..... 노래가 좀 밋밋하다고 해야되나? 노래 먼저 들었을때 딱 이노래로는 절대로 1위 못할거라는 생각이 제일 먼저 들었음,, 11월 라인업이 워낙 엄청나서 좋은 노래 들고와도 1위 할수 있을까 말까였을텐데
Denise Yun	my sakura😍improve so much how can we don’t love her🌸
christie claus	CHAEYEON!!!!!!!!!!!
오램{피치깡}	프로듀스48 안그래도 빨리 끝났는데 (?) 이정도면 잘했쥬..ㅠ 노래에 집중이 안돼..ㅠ 얼굴이 너무 이뽀소..💕💕

Kei Jiwo	Wow eunbi really looks like Irene red Velvet
장보고	뮤비가 걍 부산스럽다...특징도 없고 특별히 눈에 들어오는 멤버도 없고...퀄리티가 높다고 볼수없다...안유진 팬인데 좋게 봐줄레도 전문가인 당신들이 봣을때 정말 만족해서 이렇게 출품한거요..???아티스트로써 뮤비 만든건가요..?상업적인 이득을위해 만든건가요..?
sh_n14 00	JAPANESE MEMBERS SCREENTIME WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU
Annjhelica Reyes	3:20 oh my cute little bean, Nako.
축구를 좋아하는 소녀	춤보다 노래보다 개빡치는게 파트 분별 차이가 너무 심해요 제 최애가 나코언닌데 뮤비에 딱 2번밖에 안나오고 분량 10초도 안되고 센터도 10초도 안되고 진짜 ,,, 제 최애로써 더 빡치네요
hslpt3	come here just to look for some nasty comments abt how some other members are not deserving their screentime or how their bias deserve everything good n others deserve shiet(of course, in indirect shading style) from youknowwhosefans... not disappointed (as always lol) ....song doesn't leave impression... didn't hear with earphone, but doubt doing so would change it...
도담이	ioi 드림걸보다 나은건가..ㅡㅡ 왜 데뷔곡은 이리 못 만들지
Levie Haf	Spotlight of this MV is Lee Chaeyeon.
박정희	기대가 너무커서 기대했던거보단 아니지만 나쁘진않음 괜찮은데?

Keey Seee	I CANT FREAKING FOCUS ALL OF THEM SHINES
박병준	뮤비 때깔이나 노래퀄은 나쁘지않고 애들은 완전 예쁘긴한데.. 데뷔곡의 임팩트는 드림걸즈보다도 약한뎈ㅋㅋ꙼̈ 진짜 어떤분 댓글대로 데뷔 5년차 걸그룹의 수록곡 혹은 후속곡 느낌 프리스틴 줄려다가 여기로 온거아냐 걍?
셜록홈즈의후손	음...딱히 기억나지는 않는듯 엄청 기대했는데...하이라이트도 자세히 모르겠음 그래도 예쁘니까!
ZAiRRA	Nako :D ❤

선량한무즙	노래 좋다 ㅅㅂ 일본애들의 성장의 폭이 넓어서 보는게 재밌네 근데 뮤비 퀄이 왜 저러냐 콘택 렌즈 광고 한 저 여자애 디게이쁘다 근데 일본애들 파트가 적다
Tiara Devi Anggarini	Yena nge rap 😍😍
asgar ismail	Eun bi look Irine
보리	3:02
최유이	애들은 다 이쁜데, 데뷔곡이 뭔가 빵하고 터지는 느낌이 업따... ㅠㅠ
우주최강워너원	아이오아이.워너원보단 못나갈듯... 워너원은 데뷔하자마자 음원차트 1위였는디.. 노래가 중독성은 없는듯.. 컨셉이 안어울림. 11월 엑소 블핑 레벨 워너원 트와이스등 컴백하는분들 많은뎅.. 참 어려운 시기에 데뷔를하넹^^ 국민청원논란까지..데뷔 오늘했는뎅 이게 무슨 일이곻ㅎㅎ 휴...
HyunJinny	Best Birthday gift ever 💕🌹

我が家のぺちゃノヤ	待ってました！！！
NCT IS LIFEU	I'm a new fan and I'm curious on how to pronounce their group name,can y'all teach me how?
zenny ying	I think this is too soft for a debut. They need something’s EDM kinda
이성민	그래도 이 정도면 시작은 나쁘지 않은듯. 시작부터 빵 터지면 좋겠지만, 그건 쉽지않고, 문을 여는 곡으로서는 괜찮네요. 오히려 후속곡에서 빵 터져주는게 더 좋을듯. 첫곡이 빵터지면 후속곡때 너무 큰 부담이라...스톤 뮤직이니 어느 정도는 해줄거라 봅니다. 그나저나 이걸 보니 떨어진 일본 멤버들 좀 아쉬울 것 같긴하네요. 일본 애들 뭔가 분위기가 확 달라졌는데.... 일본에서 활동할때는 다들 이상해 보였는데...
撕成懂	대박👏
예 예	파트분배 잘한듯.. 그리고 김민주 ㄹㅇ 개이쁘다 ㄷㄷ;;

에잉	와 진짜 하나도 모르겠다 딱히 중독성이 있는 부분도 없고 부르기도 되게 애매하고 뭐야 생각했던 것보다 별로다 뮤비만 보면 되게 활발한데 노래는 뮤비랑 다르게 좀 차분혀;;이건 뭔 조합 그래도 후렴만큼은 ㄱㅊ네
Ryu Andrew	음... 노래가 일단... 좃망인가???? 좋다는 생각은 하나도 안드네.... 혹시나해서 리피트 해서 두번 들어봤는데 역시 안좋은가???? 장원영 너무 예뻐서 기대를 많이하고 봐서 그런가.. 장원영이 안보이네??? 조명이나 화장이 장원영 매력 깍아먹는 느낌?? 전~혀 장원영 매력을 못느끼겠음.. 포니테일 했을때는 오히려 김도아 나온줄 알았음..ㅡㅡ;; 권은비나 채연이나 얼굴이 내 취향이 아니라서 화면에 나올떄마다 약간씩 거부감 드는데....  굉장히 권은비가 오래 나오네???? 거의 권은비 메인급인데?? 소리가 다른애들에 비해서 특색있고 메보자리 차지하고 있어서 그런가???? 왜 뮤비 끝나고 나니 권은비 조커닮은 얼굴에 거부감 느끼던 기억밖에 안남지?? 네가티브 쪽이긴 해도 임팩트가 쎄서 그런가?? 그리고 2절부터는 채연이 권은비 자리 차지하고 나오네... 힘들다..... 안유진이 뭔가 보이쉬한 카리스마 같은걸 발휘할줄 알았는데.. 그냥 피곤한 순둥이?? 역시 임팩트 없고... 차라리 티아라 은정이를 따라가더라도 숏컷을 하는게??? 민주도 역시 장원영처럼 임팩트 없음.. 애가 순둥해서 그런가??? 나왔나?? 싶은수준... 대신 나올떄 표정은 확실히 좋아졌음.. 옛날보단 멘탈이 좀 강해진듯.. 의외로 혜원이가 임팩트가 남네??? 얼마나 좃망일지 구경이나 하자는 생각으로 봤는데.. 춤추는데선 저 뒤에 놔서 안보이게 하고... 노래분량은 코러스 라인 줘버린후에 기계로 심하게 만져버리니깐 깔데를 찾을수가 없음.. 게다가 이번 컨셉이 혜원이랑 어울리는 청순 컨셉이다보니..그냥 앉아서 입만 뻥긋하고 있어도 미모만 빛을 발하는듯... 근데 이건 나중에 무대영상보면 바로 뒤짚힐수도 있겠지???  일본애들 들어왔을 때부터 안무는 캐망이겠구나?? 생각했는데.. 그냥 손장난??? 정도의 한심한 안무였고.. (진짜 드림캐쳐 안무보다가 와서 이거보니. 하품나온다 아 그리고 일본애들은 이마저도 제대로못하네.... 손목에 깊스했냐?? 어떻게 저런 간단한 손동작 하나도 제대로 못하지???) 나코 키떄문에 전체적으로 라인 밸런스 안맞겠다고 생각하면서 나코 춤추는 부분을 유심히 봤는데... 키가 문제가 아니었어.. 다리 졸라 짧은데 두께가 옆에애들 두배정도는 되는듯..ㅡㅡ;;; 깜짝 놀랐다 진심... (근데 그렇다고 라인이 안무너진것도 아니다... 후반부 다들 걸어나오는 씬에서.. 오른쪽만 쥐파먹었냐????)  히토미는 왜 뽑은거야?? 얘말고 한초원, 김도아,허윤진같이 도움될 애들 많았을텐데.. 왜 공기를 뽑았어???? 일본 공기는 방사능 첨가라 맛나서 뽑은거야??? 뭐 암튼.. 진짜 예능으로 데뷔 안하고 이 노래 하나만 들고나온 신인 걸그룹이라고 생각하면.. 예쁘애들 몇 있는 그저그런 애들... 정도???? 저 바닥에서 놀고있겠네.... 아 참.. 아이돌룸 주간 아이돌및 여타 예능프로출연을 희망합니다...... 춤이라던가... 섹시댄스라던가 이배속이라던가 시켰을때 요주의 몇몇 ㅄ들이 과연 어떤 병신짓을 할까 기대... 통편될려나???? 뭐 나야 병신들 다 걸러지고 내가 좋아하는 6명 예쁜모습만 몰아서 나오면 좋지!!!
Mailida Alison	NAKOOOOOOOOOO!❤❤❤
오렌지	혼다히토미 엄청이뻐졌네 나코.사쿠라도 훨씬 세련되졌네. 이번에 akb48  신곡 뮤비보고 놀란가슴 라비앙로즈보고 가라앉았네 아이즈원MV가 프듀101  역대급으로 MV잘뽑아낸듯. 많은애들이 노래중독성은 잘모르겠다하는대  나는 입에서 라라라 라비앙로즈 입에 착착감김

Sakura screen time enhance her beauty and charisma and her voice and the way she dance, improve a lot and to Hyewon, she shocked me. The song is good but it's not catchy.

。河さん	전체적으로 상큼, 발랄 톡톡 튀는 애들 모아놓고 곡 컨셉을 잘못 잡은듯...좀 더 임펙트 있고 밝은 곡이었으면 좋았을텐데..곡이 이상한건 아닌데 애들이랑 좀 안맞는것 같다..아쉽..
Sistar Fans	What a soft music.. i really love that
-냉동닭발	노래가 딱 기억에 남는 부분이 없다. . . 컨셉도 정확히 알 수 없는 정도에 데뷔곡이 이러면 안되는거지.. 대충 롤린롤린쯤 되면 평타 치겠는데 이건 쫌 아니다...;;
infinite my life my love	chaewon❤eunbi❤hwaiting💪💪
Rallion Angeles	Okay! Eunbi own this MV im dead
곽민지	노래 전체적으로 좋긴한데 뭔가 임팩트가 없다 데뷔첫곡인데 노래좀 잘뽑지 노래가 아이즈원빨 받는 느낌이냐 ㅠ ㅠ 11월달에 숨돌릴틈도없이 음원깡패들 줄줄이 나올텐데 ,,
v i n	2:22 , thank you, im dead happily hitomi :")

arch Dark	튜닝을 너무 과하게 한것 아닌가 싶네요. 다음곡에서는 음정이 조금 불안하게 들려도 좋으니 순수한 목소리도 들을수 있기를 기대해봅니다. 다들 알자나요 아이즈원이 보컬위주의 그룹은 아니라는걸요. 과한 튜닝보다는 자연스런 목소리가 좀 더 들리기를~

S.h.a S.h.a	They are all so pretty! I did watch pd48 and waiting for their debut but I'm not really into this song. Still, fighting!
Lily Likesfood	I feel like this concept doesn’t suit them (music video wise). It reminds me of I AM where they don’t know whether or not they should be cute or sexy (just not as bad).   The other thing is that when they use the red backdrop it looks a bit cheap - at 3:26 at the bottom right the red carpet didn’t cover the floor completely which looked weird.   When the song ended they skipped straight to the logo// name, I wish they had a bit of a pause/ zoom out so everything seemed smoother  Then again, the good thing about this concept was that it was unexpected, as in pretty sure most of us thought it was going to be a cute concept considering the center.

라타	47분전이라 떳을때보고 2시간 전이라 뜰때 한번 더 본 사람입니다. 아이즈원이 얼마나 힘들게 데뷔했는지 잘 압니다. 그러니 우익이라 뭐라 논란이 되니 슬플따름입니다. 안티들이 있는가 하면 팬도 존재하기 나름입니다. 그러니 안티들은 신경쓰지 마세요 언니들..안티들에게 신경쓰면 안되요 제발.. 모든 아이돌한테는 다 안티가 있어요..그러니 안티있다고 슬퍼하지마요..안티가 있으면 팬도 있는 법이니까요.

Number 9	TO ANYONE NEW HERE! HERE ARE THE MEMBERS! . . Nako is the smallest one probably the smallest vocal to ever exist in Kpop. She can kill you by existing  . Wonyoung is the child Centre a total Jail Bait. Do not touch her if you wanna go to pedo jail. . Hitomi is the one that looks like a chipmunk ❤ probably the cutest person to ever exist. She dances better than all of us here in the comment section. . Sakura is the gorgeous one with the Short hair, she sucks at sports like she cant save her own life by playing sports. Honestly the purest person in the group. She's the 2nd oldest and Chaeyeon wife. . Eunbi is Gods daughter the one with the black hair shes the oldest. . Chaeyeon is the blonde that dance better than life, Sakuras Husband, Korean Teacher, Moral support. She's Sakuras everything. . Hyewon one of the rappers. She's only trying to make a living for her daughter Minami who is currently leaving in Japan. Part of the Legendary Boombaya Squad.  . Minju is the Visual of all Visuals Visual. If Visual has a Visual Minju is the Visual. . Chaewon is the one with the Brown Hair and bangs  Eunbis 1st and original Daughter. . Yujin is Wonyoung partner in crime. Probably killed someone at one point shes only 15. You going to pedo jail if you touch her. . Yuri is the one hitting all the notes. I heard God gave her the voice of an Angel so feel free to feel shook. . Yena the meme of the group. Hella talented. Was born to be an idol. Her brother could be your next Oppa, 24/7 has her hand gun pointed on her head.

Vik Toria	I'm surprised it's not a cute song. And I don't really feel it. They look kinda bad together, which is also surprising.  Maybe it's like this only in mv.  Also they need young energetic song. Some of them look too childish and it looks a bit stupid with all these hip sways.

Really clean, good production, their voices are perfect for this kind of song, sounds classy and not trying to be edgy on the rap parts is a plus. The video is simple but goes so well with the song. What a nice start for this group! I'll keep an eye on them

lydiee L	노래나 컨셉자체가 안좋은건 아닌데 데뷔곡으로 이목 집중시키기는 살짝 무리가 있지 않나 싶음.. 뭔가 데뷔곡으로 어느정도 대중성 잡고 나서 이 곡을 뽑았으면 어땠을까 하는 아쉬움 ㅠㅠ 일단 노래만 듣는것과 무대가 더해지는건 차이가 있으니 음악방송 기대해보겠음!

Shafira Dian Rizki Fitriana Nasution	*I guess the pd-nim in pd48 and in izone is the same people* Why? Cause the screentime still biased to yujin-woonyoung-yuri-eunbi and chaewon..  To be honest, these people is the one I see the most in the mv and they even have so much line, i cant even barely hear jline sing and appears  I have to be super focused and not even blink to make sure that nako-hicchan-hyewon is still in the group or not

R.A.P	For every J-Line fans from AKB era.... Dont need to complaint about the line distribution and MV screentime.... KPOP MV is different than AKB MV which based on popularity (lets be honest although there 16 member senbatsu, rank 10 and below barely got screentime forger about solo shoot). And line distribution is according to is member voice suit the line or not.... even sometime main vocal get less line than lead vocal  (for most group the reff part always got sung by main vocal thou) and remember every group from Produce project always put rank 1(center) to be main attention of their MV either they appeared at first minute of MV or be the main protagonist if MV is story theme.... Im Sakura fans too here, but i can understand the distribution of line and screentime..... Because thats how K-POP work....

HyungWooDK	God, so many girls
Kayla Rahmania Syafa	💕💕💕💕
Lizzie K.S	Who said yena can't rap? who said hyewon can't sing? who said chaeyeon deserved 12th place? who said wonyoung didn't deserve 1st place?   La vie en Rose proving you wrong.
겨울싫엉	노래가.... 뭔가 팍 꽂히는 부분이 없네 애들 다 예쁘고 뮤비도 예쁘고 다 좋은데 노래는 더 좋은거 없었나? 뭔가 아쉽 ㅠㅠ
강바다	왤케 나코 파트가 없음...?? 나코도 높은 순윈데 파트 분배 무엇..ㅋㅋㅋ

이뻐요지우개는	좋다 ㅎㅎ
john johnson	앨범에 있는 노래 다 들어봤는데 라비앙로즈는 확 와닿는 킬링파트가 없고 뮤비가 좀 저예산 느낌. '아름다운 색'으로 mv상큼하게 뽑아서 활동하는게 더 나을수도 있겠단 생각이 듬.
Samantha Ibarra	J liiiineee
Aimmie aim	They should gave hyewon more lines. I’m disappointed 😞
acacia Music	데뷔곡인데 기억에 남는 뭐가 하나도 없는  심심한 짜집기한 곡같네  채원 유리 유진  파트는 어딘가 익숙한 느낌

Bae	Chaeyeon Minjoo slays
Madie	Sakuraaaaaaa
Bling Bling	음 좀 실망스런퀄리티네 곡은 둘째치고 뮤비너무 저예산인걸...
Woojoo Jung	영어는 됐고, 한국어 댓글만 봤을 때는 내가 진짜 이 노래가 좋은건지 아니면 프듀 방송보면서 애들이 친숙해져서 그냥 아빠미소가 나오는건지 잘 모르겠다. 아무튼 아저씨는 응원한다 화이팅

훗•	호불호 개갈린다 딱 보고 뮤비는 괜찮게 나온거 같은데 노래가 중독적이진 않아 뭔가 계속 듣고 싶어지진 않고, 그렇다고 안좋은 노래는 아니야 이게 제일 화나는게 나코는 리보라면서 파트가 3초분량 이라는거야 나는 지금 졸라 짜증이나 소속사 똑바로해

소원	솔직히 노래나 컨셉은 진짜 마음에 쏙 드는데 대중적이지 않다는 점에 공감함 ㅜㅜ 뭔가 확 꽂히는 가사도 없고... 근데 뮤비 색감이나 코디는 넘넘 예쁜 것
ภู รินนน	Yena! i love your rap.

강정원	개인적으로는 생각보다 별로.. 음악이 별 특징이 없는 것 같음. 그래도 응원함, 다음 곡은 잘 뽑힌 곡으로 나왔으면 좋겠음.
말썽꾸러기뚱인뎁	뭔가 딱와닿는부분도없고,,일본인들분량도,,😓 한국어발음이부족해도좀더넣어줬으면좋았을텐데ㅜㅜ 그래도아이즈원맴버들다잘했담!❤👍👍

Mimo Cat	My pretty and talented girls😭💜 You did a good job.  IZ*ONE FIGHTING! 💜
JoHnN L	I expected something better, I just liked the chorus of the song "La la vie en rose", I gave it because I like the effort of some of them, but honestly it had better thing in the presentations of Produce 48, I found the debut song a little weak, not is bad but it's also not something I would listen to often, at least this song sounds like a version of Laboum - Between us (I'm not a Laboum fan)
của cá	CHAEYEONIE <3 She's absolutely gorgeous and is an exceptional performer as always. All in all, I think it's a solid debut. Congrats girls! You all did well!

Jeka Pedro	Suport the girls for new idol
악플러	노래는 좋은지 안좋은지 모르겠는데 안무는 괜찮은것 같네 의상 컨셉도 나름 괜찮고 비쥬얼이야 어디가서 꿀리는 외모들은 아니니까 패스  일단 이것만 한번 봐서는  내눈에 조유리 장원영 이둘밖에 딱히 기억에 남는 애들이 없음(분량만  봤을때)  일본애들 3인방 좀 기대했는데  m/v 한 10번 정도 돌려보면  그제서야 보이겠지만
kimmy x	I love the song, the MV, the outfits but why is Sakura always in the back tho? 😌 Still, excellent debut song! Fighting IZONE! 🌸❤

seojung Kang	솔직히 곡에 맞게 감정표현 잘 살리는건 이채연밖에없네,  곡은 잘 뽑은거 같고, 분배도 적당하고, 나쁘진않네, 이제 갓 데뷔한 신인이니 발전가능성은 무궁무진 하겠지만,  파트분배로 옘병떨지말자 진짜로...일본가면 일본맴버들한테 분배 많이주것지 멍청한것들아;;

IDIA A	솔직히 갠적으로 노래는 괜찮은 거 같은데 너무 대중적이지 못하다는게 문제... 호불호 너무 갈림  뮤비, 의상, 안무, 메이크업 다 괜찮은데 라비앙 로즈?? 노래 제목 자체부터 독특하기만 하고 딱 튀는게 없어서 대중들이 기억하는데는 시간이 좀 필요할 듯....

とっと	IZONE大好き！！ 応援してます♡
вαву вυи	for anyone who doesn't know this already, 'la vie en rose' is in French and it literally means 'life in pink' but a more accurate translation is *life through rosy (pink) glasses* and we often use it to say 'je vois la vie en rose' which means 'i see life in pink' which expresses delight, joy and optimism. btw this is *A TOTAL BOP* imma prolly be listening to this religiously for the next few weeks lol 💘💘💘
Tô Thần	Sakura .I LOVE YOU !

Spanz Klyde	What a boring song for a debut. Bloody disappointing. No criticism towards the girls though. They didn't choose this song nor the choreography...
tzuyork	*yena's rap   me: died
SY G	곡도좋고 비주얼좋고 이채연 사쿠라 나코 히토미 김민주 권은비 김채원 다 미쳤는데 대체 뭐때문에 1% 아쉬운가 했더니 뮤비 마무리가 "로즈"랑은 하나도 관계없어보이는 아이즈원 로고로 급하게 끝나버려서인듯 앞에서 기껏 잡아놓은 분위기 갑분로고됨....라비앙로즈 타이틀 폰트 예쁜걸로 장미색 입혀서 넣어줬으면 얼마나 기억에도 남고 뮤비 분위기도 이어가고 좋겠냐고 ㅉㅉㅉ멤버들이 살렸다 진짜

Mikayla Merna	Who said izone' debut is gonna fail? Even though i don't like the final lineup, I think this song is a bop and they have a really strong concept and visual, a new monster rookie joining the game. Phew, this November is a competitive month I can't wait to see their debut stage>.<

히죽 히죽	타이틀곡 참 별로네
Joseph Weller	Great song great MV just not a song I would think they would open up with. They have so much youth and beauty in their group its criminal to dress them in pastels and make them do boring choreography with these old school hand movements. I'm ok with the line distribution and screen time but you won't see covers of this dance all over IG and for me that's how songs get popular. Overall 6/10 for me.
Washington Rodrigues	i just watched the first episode of iz*one chu they are so adorable.

hoseokshobi	Congrats on your debut girls! I'm sure Wonyoung can handle her position as a center in the future, in fact she already did now! Every concept suits her honestly! I don't get the hates on her. Minju got her confidence improving too! Chaeyeon and Eunbi is a triple killer, Yena slayed the rap, J-line visuals are overflowing, especially Sakura's! Vocal queens Yuri Chaewon and Yujin got my wig lmao. And not mistaken, Hyewon did great too! Let's see more of the girls in the future, fighting!
army once	At last they debuted
Salma Alang	No offence with wonyoung and her smiles but Sakura reaaaaallllly fit the image of this comeback. I wish there were more shots of her instead.  To be honest, Im still bitter that (lets face it) wonyoung won just beacuse she if freakin' korean.   This song is good itself but I dont think that its a good choice for a debut song  Ps. These are my opinions and regardless if you like it or not, I wont change it
JirpP Supamit	Saranghae
Ashley Mejia	And.... I’m dead🔥❤️ God this if beautiful. Chaeyeon ma baby❤️🔥 you’re doing great. Btw this group is going to be a bop.💁🏾‍♀️
Miss Fangirl	THIS SONG IS A BOP!!! I REALLY DON'T REGRET STANNING THEM!  CHAEWON'S VOICE IS ENOUGH TO SNATCH MY WIG  YENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SNATCHED MY REAL HAIR AAAAAH!!! I LOVE HER!!! THAT RAP PART♡  WONYOUNG, OUR GIANT BABY, YOU DESERVE THAT CENTER SPOT♡  ALL OF THEM ARE DOING GREAT♡ HOPE THEY'LL GET THEIR FIRST MUSIC SHOW WIN WITH LA VIE EN ROSE♡  just a question, will they have a live streaming on vlive for the showcase?
Kartika Kristia	I am so proud Sakura can debut in Korea..... This MV is very beautiful... I like powerfull Eunbi and Chaeyeon part...
Haneul Jung	Gaada awalan kaya wannaone dulu yak:') aduh
빠빠뿌뿌	귀욥당
lovetrain00	Nako's fans may be disappointed because of the relatively small parts in this MV.  However, Nako has extra killing parts and plays an enticing role as a main center in the last scene.  Thus, Nako's role is like a significant closer of baseball game.
tetzelleprizes	Yah need more Sakura screen time
이재률	뭐지 노래리듬은괜찬은데 아직까지 많이못들어서 거리감이있어 .......

dessert fox jisoo	Our Hyewon improve alot!!! Please support her
sweet breeze	동남아 애들이 일본 멤버 앞에 안 세우고 노래 적게 부른다고 비추 저렇게 많이 날린 거야?  어느 나라 그룹인 줄 모르나 보네.   일본 멤버들이 앞에 서려면 트와이스 멤버만큼 한국어를 할 줄 알아야지.  지금 아이즈원 멤버는그 삼분의 일도 못 해.  트와이스만큼해도 힘든 거야.   아이즈원멤버도 한국에서 더 인기 끌려면 사나,모모,미나 정도로 빨리 한국어를 할 줄 알아야 해.

Stevanie Grace	b aja
Haru Renford	I feel like whoever made the song really knows their strength and talents. The song is 3 minutes and 36 seconds, yet it feels like 5 minutes. Such rollercoaster. And the ending feels like a second song but not too different so it's like a continuation instead of a new song.  Made this list, kinda hard to do since I often got lost and stare at the MV instead of writing. Had to replay lots of time before I can finish this. Personally, I don't like to hear high pitch voice for more than a few seconds. So this is what I think:  1. Wonyoung made this looks like SNSD's. Great job, center! 2. Minju's voice really helps to tone it down. 3. Yujin's best appearance in MV, gotta love her clear fresh voice. TOLD YOU GUYS SHE'S GREAT FOR MV!! Sorry 4. Sakura slays her fans again. The way she moves is just different. The crew who made this MV is brilliant! 5. Chaewon 's high note, everyone? Woot! She did fine <3 6. They really made her an innocent rapper. Haha 7. Hitomi's voice is so nice to hear after all their high pitch. SERIOUSLY 8. Chaeyeon. Wooow. Queen! She nailed it, with a blonde hair and powerful dance! 9. Eunbi is exactly how I expect her to be. I like how she carried the song to Yuri. It is not easy :3 10.Yuri basically has the best part in the song and it's perfectly done. Best voice I ever heard and she's beautiful. 11.We have duck rapper too! My dreams came true. Thank you OTR and Mospick! 12.Nako as center? OMG. My heart can't take it. I didn't expect this xD

pini 0208	ちぇうぉん🌹うんび ふぁいてぃん"(ﾉ*>∀<)ﾉ♡
Sylee	yep. the line distribution is not balanced, its same as other girlband also with 12 member, moreover one of them she isn't Native Korean, even she ever got below 10 second and didnt get the line distribution, but the pre-debut of those girlband in MVs is fill the existence in other members one by one.  I hope IZ*ONE will better than this in MV, so more balancing this line distribution. keep practice for Japanese Girls so you can have the front position next time and everybody in Japan will always cheer you guys up.  and then, I love the music. Like Acoustic vibes but some of parts doesn't catch my interesting except the reff. but this first debut is quite awesome. I like the concept of Roses (beside my favorite color is red and flower is rose) there's combination between feminine, elegance and some of deep strong voice thats make this is quite unique.  Keep it up, IZ*ONE 😊👍
예원 [박우진]	와진짜 다이쁘다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 원영언니 미쳣다진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 젤이뻐 ㅠㅠㅠ 이번노래개좋고 데뷔축하해요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 근데 뮤비에 더신경좀쓰지 .. 너무허전하다 ㅠㅠ 와 보면서 다개이뻐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

beautiful easy	かわいいだいすきです！
LOVE BTS	Chae-young amazing.Kiss kiss 💋💋 Where fan ❤️ Chaeyeon???????
이동우	생각보다 파트분배 일본맴 너무 적다고 비판 글 많네 ;; 가장 큰 이유는 한국어임. 한국어 발음이 안좋은데 파트 많이줘버리면 곡 자체가 망해서 결국 데뷔도 망함. 그리고 두번째 이유는 어쩔 수 없음 일본맴버가 한국맴버들보다 가창력 부족해서 그럼. 강혜원 보셈 가창력 부족하면 당연히 파트 적게 줄 수 밖에없지 일본처럼 실력도 없는데 인기 빨로 파트 많이 주길 원함? 여기는 한국임^^

Baihaqqi Nursyahbani	I actually still a little bit salty about my bias(es) doesn't make it to the group and the fact that this is literally better than my all time fave gg IOI debut song.. But in the other hand, i didn't really expect IZONE debut song will be this good man like damn..
kim우리두사람	아이즈원 노래와 안무 너무너무 좋습니다.♡ 방탄소년단처럼 매사 혼신을 다한다면, 단언건대 불가능은 없을 거라 믿어요. 부디, 꼭 !  아시아의 벽을 넘어 미국 빌보드에도 당당히 입성하는 멋진 모습 기원합니다.♡
백민기	흠 좀 불편
Joshua. Revilla.	eunbi's part in 0:44 - 0:49 is the best part try and change my mind

SUGA Bear	Still not convinced by 2-3 members (i only liked like 4 members of the final line up before, so it's progress) but the song is cool (something I hardly say) and FUCKING HELL SAKURA, CHAEYEON, EUNBI AND YENA WERE MY FAVORITES.
Kain Black	애기들 응원한다! 아.. 권은비씨는 애기 아니죠 참 'ㅁ'
inaba shinji	아..; 데뷔곡이 왜이래 평가곡이 더나은거같네
EnPi Channel	I love sakura, she is so pretty and sexy with red dress ❤️❤️ And the white suit too ❤️❤️
Jade Luu	The ending is a bit too quick. I wanna see my Nako more :-( But I really think for the first time in the history of Produce, the popularity gap between the center and other members won't be too big.

미래를위하여	음.....다들 예쁘긴한데....... 노래가 그닥..ㅡ.ㅡ 노래 잘부른 애들 많은데.. 왜이리 음역대가 낮은지....?
JeLLY BeaN	It’s kinda sad that nako gets like only 1-2 lines
다연이	뮤비보니까 더 이쁜 장면도 많은데 썸네일.. 좀 별로당
DFLI LYS	I like seeing pattern where pd groups ended up have two main vocals (yuri and eunbi) and two lead vocals (chaewon and chaeyeon), which is good I wish nako and hitomi has more lines but their dance break parts make it worth it. Pronunciation on point Kinda plot twist that yena main rapper here instead of hyewon, but performance wise, this is her best performance The rest four, esp center giant maknae, is absolutely stunning, only wish sakura has more center part even tho wonyoung is the center bc she has a lot of invisible lines I wish this is gonna be huge debut for long-term
Arya Wibawa	Hyewon and Hitomi 😥

My Name is No	chaeyeon hair look stunning 😍 she really slay this look. and people keep complaining about fans that say j-line deserve more screentime. J-line deserve more screentime, it their debut mv after all. they need people regonise them in this debut mv. im so shock with the little amount of screen time for j-line. where is sakura? where is nako? where is hitomi? yes, it is korea debut, and they not really fluent with korea, but what about the screen time showing k-member face that not even singing?

Quetta12	Sakura still shines wherever position she is dancing or how short her lines are. I'm happy enough that she did great in this MV.  Her personal close up looks so gorgeous & sexy at the same time. The same things goes to ther J-line members. They are doing very well in their part. Please don't complain about their line not long enough. It will affect our bias & give them bad image. They have 12 members so it's hard to distribute the lines evenly.

정대훈	정말 중요한 데뷔곡인데.. 먼가..흠.. 입에 붙는게 없다고해야할지.. 기타 유행된 노래들 보면 흥얼거릴 수 있는 살짝이라도 중독성이 있거나 눈에 확 띄는 임팩트있는 부분등 이라는게 있는게 대부분이였고 거기에 열광했는데.. 솔직히 이곡엔 그런게 없는게 같아요 진짜 예쁘고 노래 잘 부른다고 100%성공하는건 아니구나... 라는걸 느낄정도입니다 그래도 사쿠라나 나코의 몰라볼정도의 변신과 다른 여그룹과는 확실히 다른색이 느껴지는건 좋네요기대 많이 했는데 꼭 성공했으면 좋겠습니다

what's a username	they actually did a pretty good job with the line & center distribution!! i know a lot of people wish they'd see their favorite or the underrated members more (for me it's hyewon for example) but i believe this is a pretty good start for them!! it's only the beginning and i'm sure with time all of the members will be able to show their true colors

MUHAMAD FATHUR RIVALDO	Sakura give a biggest visual
FlixerDK	I'm sure the line distibution gets better in the future, and the Japanese members will get more lines in their Japanese releases, but for a first song this line distirbution makes sense. Yuri is the main vocalist, Yena is the main rapper, Chaeyeon and Eunbi are lead vocalists, and Wonyoung got number 1 on the show, so it makes sense that those 5 gets the most lines.

Juchi Quimchi	Okay this mv is amazing but I just want to point out Hyewon and Nako is it? Umm. I get that Hyewon is doing 2nd voice rapping but it feels like she isnt like you know doing anything. Like they just slap some small lines to hyewon on other members singing. And Nako. I feel quite bad for her since she is not singing too much. She is a great vocalist like her pre debut days. I get why she was not capable of showing her singing abilities: Almost all members are beautiful vocalist. And some are high vocalist. Its pretty difficult to distribute high notes when youre in a very numbered group. So they just add her some killing parts instead of high notes. But I hope someday she gets the part she wants and deserve. And for Hyewon too. It would be nice to add a second rap after Yena's. But overall this mv is amazing. And this girlgroup is amazing too. Queens of visual, vocalist. Fwaiting Izone!!!

anne snixx	In my entire life as a Kpop fan, I have never waited for a debut MV to start EXCEPT this one. 🌹  I've seen them grow since PD48 and I'm really proud of them. Let me comment about each member based on this MV.  Wonyoung = I was upset when she got first place but I'll keep quiet now. She really did justice to her being center. I'm not a fan but I have to say she is really a standout. Baby Giant made me eat my words. Sakura = She has the Yoona vibes in this video. And her "la la la la vie en rose" keeps playing on my head. Yuri = I'm a fan of her vocals. No wonder she finally debuted in this group after losing Idol School. Yena = I was surprised she got the raps but man, Yena had the swag! <3 She's really talented. Yujin = I thought she would do the rap. Her visuals are very unique. She really sings well. Nako = Cute. I somehow like her nasal voice. Eunbi = She is soooo sexy. I'm watching her parts, especially the first one, with my tongue hanging out. Lol. Hyewon = She improved so much. Haters can leave now. You can't deny that she is really beautiful. Hitomi = Another cute one. It's nice to see that she can also pull off this concept. Chaewon = Wow. Her vocals are really great!  Minju = She is my bias. It's a given already that she's really pretty. But I'm so proud that her confidence is back. No wonder that she was included in this group because her potential is always there. :) Chaeyeon = I can't imagine IZ*ONE without this girl.
Sylvia Nijnuis	Love them so much!

jufiasca chan	For those fans who have their own biases, please just support the group. In the end, all of them is still IZONE. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ I have a very far fetched guess that they will deBut in japan too with japanese version with different line distribution.  I don't know, don't judge me. I'm not updated and this is just my wild speculation and WISH!!! I have a bias also but I love all of them, if possible I want all top 20 girls or even the top 30 to debut. But, oh well, only 12 members are needed and won the right to debut as IZONE.
Nur Efsan	Tbh from produce show the only one who left an imfact was sakura and thats only bc of her air-time. There were so much more talented girls. Thats why I am against viewership rating. Experts should rate

jeon wonwoo is gorgeous	omg i'm an absolute sakura stan but wtf is up with the fans saying sakura got so less lines? like she got so much, she's not the best vocalist but she got alot for a 12 member group. like hitomi and nako are better vocalist but barely got anything so stop complaining.

megan mm	Chaeyeon❤❤❤
Park SungHyun	아이오아이가 정말 불쌍하다. 지금보다 실력있고 좋은 멤버로 정말 그지같은 데뷔곡, 기획사의 무능,파생그룹의 태클을 견뎌내고 신인상을 휩쓸었으니...아이즈원은 멤버 조합이 좋고 비쥬얼이 좋은데 cj와 기획사가 미친듯이 지원하고 곡도 잘 뽑았네. 실력이 아이오아이보다는 못하지만 더 성공할  듯. 역시.걸그룹은 기획력과 띵곡이 관건

지은귀여원	Y'all can't really expect that your bias would had alot of parts just think like this group has 12 members in it. And the producer chose those voice who suits the song, plus they still have more to come.
은비고딩	야부키 나코 흥해랏!
thogolmar clifton	First tyme here who are this hottest...

Stoopi.d	Omfg the amount of people saying that the Japanese girls can’t sing and that they have no lines. There Korean isn’t that good yet and it’s probably difficult for them because Japanese idols don’t train. Let’s just be respectful, if you gonna support these girls you support each one of them. That’s what a true fan does.
Sherina Hasan	Era ter(keren)❤
BBC basement	And yet they said iz*one would only fit with cute concept

Nycrean	The song is great but I dont like how shallow the music video is. It feels like it's lacking something? There's something missing and I cant point it out. Maybe it's lacking those amazing camera movements? and the scene changes? I dont know but I hope they did better in producing the video. I dod not get that chills u usually feel when watching MVs. It's not the girls tho. FIGHTING IZ*ONE!

Chocolate Mint	일뽕들 그만 앵앵대라 ;
유승수	나쁘지않네.. 잘 뽑은것같다. 다만 멤버들 나이랑 데뷔앨범이라는걸 생각하면 지나치게 성숙한 이미지로 나와버린것같음.. 데뷔 2~3년차 느낌이 나... 조금 더 어리고 청순한 이미지로 갈수있지않았을까? 청순에서 성숙(섹시,파워풀)으로 가는건 쉽지만 그 반대는 어려우니까
Sehyun Lee	초반부에 나오는 냉장고 에너지 효율 5등급인건 나만 신경쓰이나 ? ㅋㅋㅋ

Huang Justins	hiichan !!!
Victor Campos	are you guys new to kpop or something? this is not an akb48 song, the center position was not made for only one person, all the lines were basically divided according to their singing capabilities. Sakura got small lines but good screentime, Nako got a killing part, the only girls who didn't got much time to shine were Hitomi and Hyewon, and well... this is a 12 girls girlgroup. I hope they get their chance to shine, but please stop complaining about basic stuff. they all have lines, they all have solo screentime, they are all extremely beautiful, the song is awesome, let's just be grateful. This is their debut, it is already amazing and they will for sure improve in the future.

young neil	hmmm, not an instant bop, but hopefully an earworm. the line distribution is surprisingly not that bad, but still kinda iffy considering the amount of members this group has. but not bad for a debut song! definitely not the concept i thought they'd go for..............

Ayu Ratna	where is my nakoooooooo........ :(
itskey	People need to stop complaining about screen time and line distribution. It's only their first music project, there are many more to come!  Plus with a group as big as theirs it's difficult to give members equal shine, just know that they were given parts that made them stand out. And, it's not that big of a deal knowing that they still get a lot of exposure with a small amount of screen time/lines.

Sadayo Kumbera	I'M SO PROUD, THIS SONG IS SO GOOD. THE GIRLS LOOK ETHEREAL, AND I'M SO GLAD THE CONCEPT ISN'T BUBBLEGUM AND RAINBOWS. Vocals are great, rap is solid, and for Nako and Hitomi, keep working hard my loves. You'll see that screentime increase <3

Kacie Sunshinez	I'm late ;-; I love this song srsly.   Guys,  don't hate on them,  they all deserve their current rank, k. They all worked so hard for this. Although I agree some of the other trainees that didn't debut deserved to debut. Like Kaeun,  Cho Won,  And Go Yoo Jin. But just stop hating them. Don't be salty

쏘 쏘	스밍돌립시다
Nurul Aini Ahmad	Why does it seem like hyewon got the least number of lines? 😢
taekyung kim	뮤비가 너무 아쉽네.  좀 더 감각적으로  댄스컷들 보다 이미지컷을 더 많이 넣었으면 좋았을듯. 사운드도 좀 만 더 신경써서 풍성하고 이펙트 들어간 부분은 제대로 느껴지게 했어야 하지 않나 싶은. 데뷔곡인데 좀 만 더 정성스럽게 해주지...
Bonson Jim	so boring
윤유빈	사쿠라 안 보이네;; 명색이 2윈데 춤출 때 마다   뒤에서 가려지고 맨 끝에 있고 직캠 때도 가려져서 안 보일 구돈데 진짜 짜증나네..

아몽튜브 AmongTube	첫 앨범치고 성숙한 컨셉 잡은듯. 한일 그룹이라 되게 밝게 나올 줄 알았는데..!
khairul syafwan	No hate but I only see eunbi,yujin,chaewon,won young I wonder why they give the Japanese member a little line....I mean chaewon voice is good but I want to hear nako,and hitomi voice.....and I think eunbi line is much better if Yuri sing it..... That was just my opinion...so please don't take it like a bitc#
Pim Supanan	wowwwww
Rose Dizon	this is really good though?
하향원	노래는 좋은데 사쿠라는 2등인데 파트가 많이 없네 야부키 나코나 히토미는 그래도 파트가 좀 있는데 사쿠라는 파트가 별로 없네 아무리 일본인이라 해도 2등에 비해 파트가 많이 적네 ㅠㅠ
유리의비밀나라	딱 내스타일
웜니	별루에요.. 데뷔곡 치고는 인상적이지도 않고 기억에 남지도 않음.  그냥 무난한 느낌..

캐스퍼	내가 봤을때는 비교해서 미안하지만 3대 대형 기획사와 비벼보기라도 했으면 좋겠는데 이곡으론 힘들것 같다. 다음 노래 기대할게
kookie's brown shoes	i think reason j-line didn't get many lines because this is korean song and their korean is not that good yet so of course producer didn't want their song to be wasted. just wait until they can speak korean better then see how the lines distribution changed
초빼이	아....얼마전어느그룹이랑비교넘된다능;;;
卓睿慈	Wish Kaeun could be in the group... The concept really suits her.

Chang Joey	사쿠라하고 민주밖에 안보인다 사쿠라 카메라빨 올킬이다. 왜 사쿠라사쿠라 하는지 알겠다 민주는 카메라 맛사지 잘받는다 장원영을 프로듀스48적 스타일이 더 낫나 강혜원은 존재감 자체가 없다
양준모	잘듣고 갑니다~~
선비	개인적이지만 이 노래 채원이하고 너무 잘 어울린다ㅠ

ALIFF ONCExSONE	It is wrong move to give Sakura the only one wearing hat. Even without wearing hat, her aura is stand out. With hat, she just overshadowed everyone.

Sarang Kim	How do i pronounce their group name???
Earl Ezpeleta	Hitomi and Nako's voices were both a nice blend to the overall song. I think all of them sang their parts well.  I.O.I vs IZ*ONE debut comparison? IZ*ONE blasts I.O.I. (not a hater 'cause I love both groups, just comparing). This is a way better debut than that of I.O.I's, just my opinion.

Kita Pharside	곡이 변화무쌍하다. 잘 만들었네. 부드럽게 시작하다 격정적으로 치닫고 다시 그루비하게 이완하고, 다시 랩으로 릴렉스.........마지막은 폭발할듯한 기세.... 그래서 붉은 장미인가?

아침형인간	첫곡인데 노래를 이렇게 밖에 못뽑냐? 중독성있는 노래도 아니고 들을수록 좋은 것도 아니고 댄스도 어째 퇴보해 버렸냐? 기대감이 너무 큰건가
Kaylawa	와 !!! 너무 좋아 !!
Nurul Annisa	proud of them!!!!
정재문	잘 모르지만 좀 더 비트가 있는 차별화가 필요할 것 같습니다. 좀 더 성숙한 프로가 되면 좋겠습니다. 화이팅입니다.
MONBEBE Minmoongie	They are sooooo pretty 😍😍😍😍😍

Akiyuerahime	when Jotaro become a girl and dang! Sakutaro (?) #lol 🤣 Nako and Hitomi lines just made me wants to errrrrghh 👹
All Things BTS	What's new? It will always be an issue of the distribution of lines. Don't be shocked cause it will be really hard to distribute lines specially if there are 12 members in the group. So there will   only be few girls to sing a long line per song. Not everyone will be featured in one song cause it'll be hard.
Main Yuu	I LOVE YOU CHAEYOEN.. Saranghae Chaeyoen

Js Yi	유리 파트가 제일 좋다...
한경호	타이틀곡이 너무 별로다.. 리얼리티에 나왔을때 작곡가 나왔을때부터 망필이였는데..역시나네... 스타성이야 서바이벌 하면서 가지고 데뷔하는데 노래가 이모양이니..쩝..3대기획사랑 다른기획사차이는 타이틀곡뽑아내는 차이가 가장큰거 같다..진심 안타깝다..

Tifa A S	BEAUTIFUL CHAEYEON 💕
The Game	In this M/V, there's also Chaekura xD Vocals on point! Visuals on point! Love the song~ Sakura(my ult bias) may not have the best position (just from this M/V, not sure with the actual performance), probably because her skills aren't that honed yet. I don't mind it though, OTR might be protecting her. I'll be patient and wait for her growth as the group progresses. :D I love everyone in this group but I only have limited budget for albums :(
Samantha Cañales	Prettiest maknaee eveerrrr 💕
Alrose St.G	Ok giving Eunbi 0:45 and Chaeyeon 1:53 the same part is killing, I love them so much <3
Mia Malard	Tbh , the only thing I know about them is that they are the finalist of Prod 48 But the French title intrigued me xd

안시현	다 좋은데 장원영 센터 조금....
lan __	I was about to rage because of barely see nor hear Nako and Hiichan but glad they gave Nako center part even if it's just for a short time. La Vie en Rose is such an elegant song so I understand why Jlines barely have any lines because their voices are more in the cute side. I just hope the bsides will have fairer distribution. Anyway I love this song a lot. Such a great and classy start!

박인혜	아이즈원도 이게 섹시컨셉이라면 다음엔 귀여운 걸 해서 더 잘 맞을 수도 있고 다음엔 또 다른 걸 하겠죠 트와이스도 섹시도 하고 귀여움도 하고 박력도 있고 많은 컨셉을 했으니까 한 노래로만 평가하지말고 계속 지켜봅시다

Yireon ɞ ̊ ̇	3:20 Nako😍😍
stryder 021	IZ*ONE Fighting! Wonyoung as center. Hopefully this will shut those who think she doesn't deserve the center role. She totally fits it. Her voice is also unique. Sakura being Sakura. Visual attack~ (wanted to see more of her though...) Yuri with her voice. I liked her voice since PD48. Yena rapping. Do I even have to say anything about it? xD Slayed Yujin. Visuals + Vocal! Nako. Love her unique voice! Eunbi. Uri unnie jinjja nice body is slaying as well! Hyewon. I didn't feel her much in the M/V but she delivered her parts nicely. Hitomi. This kid also has a unique voice :D Chaewon. Her vocals are on point! and she's really pretty omg Minju. I think her voice is also unique, not many pointed that out though due to her overwhelming visuals. Minju + Sakura = death of WeZone (probably fandom name?) Chaeyeon. My main reason for watching PD48! Thanks to her I knew this group, followed them (even the 48G), bought both versions, and saved the group. Love her parts here!  Must stream!

kikiji001	この曲聴いてるとなつかしい言葉が断片的に 頭をよぎります・・・ひとつになってデビューおめでとう♪  なんであなたが１位候補なのかわかる気がする。 周りを気にしないでもっと自分に自信を持って。 日本ももっと頑張れるんだよってところを見せたかった ロボットが歌ってるみたい 背が高くなりたい 本番でもボールペンを口にくわえて歌うつもり？ 私の中でのセンターは・・・自信とルックスです　どちらも私にはないから・・ もっと声を出して！！！！！ 目指すところは高く・・・１位です 歌も演技も踊りも全部・・・中途半端 自分の中のコンプレックスに勝ちなさい。あなたはとても可愛い。
Lidwina Eka	Oh my Sakura keep showing her girlcrush vibes, I feel attacked. Maybe she want to prove that she can be 'cool' to Chaeyeon 😂  ALSO AHN YUJIN KEEP BEING MY BIAS WRECKER. SHE'S REALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE ME LOOKING FOR HER 😤

Hanadi q	this music video and this song saved the year. And my beautiful center baby woonyoung killed it <3. I don't know what to say they all can sing well and their visuals ;'o. yujin surprised me with her voice and lines and her beauty!!! this is the group of the year

Shreya Nand	I'M SHOOK
Ariane Wora	Chaeyon is so beautiful omg😍😍😍
Chitra Pricilia	Hyewon
Miguel Alves	I cant @ them erasing my girl SAKURA like this
Keavan Wong	Well, I got to say this, I wasn't happy AT ALL that wonyoung got to center for PD48, and I thought maybe I'd give her a chance in this MV and first few second in I was like 'hmm maybe it's going well' and then when the screen changed to sakura, eunbi, chaeyeon, yuri, yena and even minju, I could sense the fire and the charisma in them.   Wonyoung is utterly young and she relies on that natural talent but also she keep relying on that act cute pouty glossed mouth thingy which I absolutely cringe at.   She's pretty I have to admit but my eyes goes to the rest instead of her.   She's good but I think she gets outshined by the rest because they are experienced (sakura, eunbi, chaeyeon).   Would have liked her if she's not the center though tbh.

I will stay with IZ*ONE even after they have to disband. Their future looks bright. I mean, this song is the best debut song I've heard, in less than an hour they have 500k+ views, and this group is filled with hilarious, fresh, beautiful, and talented girls. It's to the point that I have no bias because I love them all so much and equally too.  Eunbi Sakura Hyewon Yena Chaeyeon Chaewon Minjoo Nako Hitomi Yuri Yujin Wonyoung  We love you all!

koog008	WOW.   SO GOT DAM WOW.  I am blown away from this debut.  When I heard the teaser I thought it would be great.  But this exceeded my expectations by so dam much.  I haven't seen a debut this good since SNSD.  Blackpink's whistle was epic but it wasn't their debut.  Everything was great, I couldn't see any weakness.  Even the rap was good.  It wasn't repetitive either.  The song had so many different layers and it transitioned so smooth and beautifully.  That drop was so nice and the hook is so dam catchy.  The visuals are no joke and the choreography was so nice.  This song is just so dam good.  I'm so got dam impressed.  WOW.  This is my song now.
siew yu peh	Wasn't very happy with the lineup at first. But damn this debut song is bombz! Can't wait for their next comeback. I think I'll just slowly like all the members now then and just forget about produce 48 HAHA

이채현	와~~~ 일본멤버들 역시 AKB48에서 썩기 아까운 존재들이야... 도대체가 야키모토 야스시가 일본 음악계를 얼마나 망쳐놓은거야??? 물론 국민성도 한몫 단단히한 탓도있겠지만... 일본멤버 3명이 한국걸그룹 시스템에 있으니 훨씬더 프로패셔널해보임.

Solepsia	I'm French, and I find too bad that they were told to pronounce "La vie en rose" this way. I'm not talking about the accent, but more about the rhythm : these are 4 different words, pronounced as if they were 3. It sounds like "L'avion rose" which means "The pink plane" :/

Valeria Vitale	This is an amazing debut with a very elegant and original concept ( it’s quite a mix between pure and girlcrush ) .  They really impressed me . At first I didn’t like this lineup very much but now I love all of them. They are a very balanced group in which every member shine and have talent.  Despite being only 14, Woonyoung is a good center and fits well this quite mature concept without making it unconfortable to watch.  Honestly, everything ( the mv, the concept , the song, the choreagraphy and even the lines and screen time distribution) is very good.  I wish this group lots of success and I hope more and more people will love them and their music .   Dear IZ*ONE , congratulations for your debut. Don’t listen to the haters and fighting!   P.S: I didn’t know Yena was such a good rapper

w e a r e o n e h a p p i n e s s	no hate but why does the song sound like a song I've  heard before
Nabila Yasmin	I didn't put my hopes that high to their debut since well, the results and all. But this song is actually really catchy and good! Really well done, yena as the rapper is definitely fitting the whole group. I like the bridge better than the actual chorus but other than that the song is a bop! Not a cute concept, not a sexy concept, just fitting for their age range and i couldn't be more happier.   Also let's appreciate Chaeyeon in that hairstyle because damn my girl looks good!
alif hanif	I,m sorry but this is too good to be a debut song TT_TT

ytsas41680	IZ*ONE definitely wasn't my favourite line-up and it is true that a lot of them were chosen for their looks... however, you can really see their talent growing in this song! And it's not like they don't work hard... however, I still feel that compared to the previous two groups, despite Wanna One being a boy group and IOI having kinda different concepts, I still feel that IZ*ONE needs more charisma; without it, they are lacking even if they had super strong vocals, rappers, and dancers. Hope they can continue to improve!  Also is it just me or is this song a little bland? Their visuals and mv design are always on point but aside from the title being quite interesting, I feel like the song itself and mv is quite generic...  PS. Please don't say I'm hating, I'm just trying to offer feedback without using hurtful words, I know the girls are trying very hard already :) and one thing I love about this comeback is THE LINE AND SCREEN DISTRIBUTION IS SO EQUAL LIKE I CAN'T EVEN TELL WHO'S THE CENTER IF I DIDN'T KNOW ALREADY

If you still have any disagreement  I don't care anymore but just wish I don't want to hear any comments saying this in YouTube or internet. Just keep the opinions, comments to yourself.  Thank you very much

sl gigi	Sakura❤❤❤
Angelina Aurelia	YAS !chaeyeon got the fells
Анастасия Андреева	This is actually much better than I expected! I thought they would come up with something sugary sweet, but the song and video are rather elegant. Eunbi's delievery is amazing as usual
spo	Kwon Eunbi was my favorite from the beginning of Produce 48.  Guess I just have really good taste.
Angkarnzaa	I'm in between like and dislike, what I like is how fresh and gorgeous they are but the music for me is kinda bland ... I hope they can spice up the music for the next single. I still support you IZONE <3
Anime, Manga, Kdrama and Kpop Lover	*Lee Chaeyeon SNAPPED!*  I seriously thought she only have few lines because of her rank in Produce 48 but no! They gave her killing lines and proved that even as the last member of Iz*one she will show her talents😄  *Fighting Chaeyeon!*

Ala La	I was so shocked with Sakura's visual. Eunby slayed. Yena too.
Laewy	This is so beautiful ;w; Wonyoung as center, the « La vie en rose » of Sakura (I’m French, the way she say it is so cute), the highnote of Yuri, the incredible rap of Yena, Yujin sing so well, Nako is to cute for this world, the voice of Eunbi, Hyewon as a so powerfull aspect, Chaeyeon dance so well (I can’t breath, she Dance so well and she’s so beautiful), Hitomi as so clear moves (her voice, a little nasal is so cute), Chaewon as a so beautiful voice and Minju looks very pretty, everything is unbelivable ✨ A so incredible debut song, dance and MV ! 🌸
B- Great	First impression i liked it. I really like the melody. It sounds really different from any Kpop songs I've heard. Also i like how their concept is more mature.

hidden story	뭐랄까 노래는 너무 평범하고 중독적인 느낌이 부족해 대중적 관심보다는 팬덤에 많이 의존할 수 밖에 없는 느낌이 드네요..... 그리고 아무래도 준비 시간이 짧아 바빴겠지만 몇몇 맴버는 매력을 잘 살리지 못한 듯한 느낌이네요.... 키차이도 커 언발란스한 느낌을 많이 줄이려 노력했는데 몇몇 장면은 매력도가 반감되는 감이 있어 아쉽네요.

I am K	1. I really really like the choreography!! Its a BOP! 2. The MV is good but not the best compare to IOI and WANNA ONE 3. I honestly like how the japanese girls sound isn't the usual japanese. ( Do you know what I meant? Japanese idol has their anime like voice which differ in a group. Like Sana, Momo and Mina in their debut days) 4. Am I the only one who think that Sakura's solo screen time is short?  Thats all. I like the song so much. It was unexpected. I hope Wannables support them.

Sinnamon Roll	So like um... heres the translation for the description: IZ * ONE - La Vie en Rose MV.  The debut mini album <COLOR * IZ (Colorize)> which is presented under the name of 'IZ * ONE' is a title that uses the same pronunciation as 'Colorize' which means 'coloring' as an English language. Aizu One released the representative color of each member as revealed in the debut teaser video. Their debut album COLOR IZ expresses the color of 'RED', which is the color that can best represent the passion of 'IZ * ONE', as the center color, 'RED' as the most beautiful ROSE, which can be expressed passionately, is a concept that will make up the album and show the passion of the members for their precious dreams and passion for debut.   Especially, the debut mini album 'La Vie en Rose' feels the charm of 'IZ * ONE' which is first unveiled, and the strong refrain is impressive. Like the title of 'rosy life', Aizu Won 's passion tells you that you and I, and all of us, will make you a' rosy life '.  In addition to this album, 'IZ * ONE (Aizu One)' is a symbolic song that can best show the identity of 'beautiful color' Beginning with the love feelings that I felt for the first time in the Teen Dance genre 'O' My ! ', A song of fairy tales that conveyed the warm sensibility of Aizu One members on a magnificent arrangement. In addition, Mnet 'PRODUCE 48' in August, debut evaluation song released in August, 'Thank you for the future' and 'I'm sorry to you? IZ * ONE "version of the main theme song" Nodoya "of 'PRODUCE48' and 'IZ * ONE' version of ' Those who have watched AIDS circle from 'PRODUCE48' can feel new charm. Beginning with the debut mini-album <COLOR * IZ>, let's see the charm of the 12 colors that Aizu One members will show to the world.

Jae	im so happy they strayed from the usual gg debut song which is usually bubble gum pop or girl crush. this was more on the aesthetic beautiful side? how to explain. they tried a new genre and im hoping that people would notice it because from all my years being a kpop fan, the debut song which rank high during debut are the catchy ones. :( the song is nice but it's not too hype-ish? im scared but will still to continue supporting my girls!!! they need to be noticed and appreciated 💖  im also happy they didnt focus only on wonyoung. the lines are kinda well distributed. altho yena didnt get to sing SHE SLAYED THAT RAP DAMN GURL.

She doesn't really need much screentime if I'm being honest. Overall this is a well-balanced MV in terms of individual airtime imo so good job to producers/editors. Not an easy task when u have a dozen members :)

BLACKPINK YOURAREA	Kim Chaewon serving High class vocal same as Yuri. Minju giving Queen aura with her Amazing Visual. I was shook Yujin visual. Sakura is an Angel. Yewon Convey her expression really well what an improvement Good Job girl. Eunbi look stunning. Hitomi i want more exposure but hoping for hitomi fancam cuz it is not enough. Nako is so cute and vocals too. Chaeyeon cant say anything aside that she dances well her vocal is undeniably amazing. Yena did the rap part :OOO love it.

WS WS	난 프듀때부터 아이즈원을 마니 좋아한 1인.. 욕먹을 각오로 쓴다.. 대박은 힘들고 중박도 글쎄다.. 먼가 휘어잡는 사비 구간이 없다.. 고급지긴 하지만.. 끓어오르려다가 그냥 식어버리는 숭늉같은 느낌..// 첫 데뷔곡이다..//  강한 인상을 주려면  "bts의 '파이어~~", 트와이스의 '어떻-게 내가~~우아우아~~" 처럼 확치고 나가는 부분이 있거나 멜러디가 졸 좋아야 하는데 그냥 이지리스닝 계열 무난한 무드음악 같다.. 안타깝다   .. 참고로 뮤비 좋고 멤버들은 졸졸 이쁘다.

Léa Péron	I like music, but just as a French woman, "Rose" in French has two meanings, one for pink (Like Edith Piaf's "La Vie en Rose") and another for rose (flower) , and the producer of this song must have misunderstood the meaning of "Rose"

Y ooja	노래 괜찮네 데뷔노래로는 퀄 매우 굳굳 채연이랑 은비가 밸런스캐기는 하구나 댄스도 그렇고 보컬도 그렇고 잘 치고 나오는 느낌이다 뭔가 데뷔라길래 좀 더 상큼한 느낌을 강조할줄 알았는데 노래는 성숙한 느낌인데 뮤비랑 의상 분위기가 발랄해서 오히려 상큼만 있는 것 보다 좋은듯

Mina Choi	ok wtf... i know the Japanese members have a long way to go with their Korean skills.. but seriously?? Sakura got 2nd place and literally every other Korean member got way more screen time than she did. And whenever it was Hitomi's part they'd show a second of her but then show the other members while her part was still going on. and Nako literally got like less than 5 seconds in the whole video. really not cool, especially with Sakura. With IOI, Somi was center as rightfully so, but Sejung got the amount of air time she deserved as #2.  This is a really good song, choreo, and concept.. such a shame that Mnet is treating their Japanese members like this. What's done is done, but let's be honest.. it's sick. + considering the momentum of the show and its ranking.. there definitely was supposed to be more Japanese members in Izone.

정현재	티져때도 느꼈지만 확실히 IOI 드림걸스보단 훨신 세련되게 잘뽑힌것 같고 멤버들의 비쥬얼이 대박이네요. 안무가 약간 군무위주라서 약간 아쉽긴한데 준비기간에 비해서는 잘나온것 같습니다. 아무래도 다인원이다 보니 군무위주의 안무는 필수지만 같은 다인원 그룹인 우주소녀 같은 군무의 완성도는 약간 부족한것 같지만  일단 데뷔곡 자체가 생각보다 잘나와서 더욱더 기대가 되는것 같습니다.. 확실히 오프더레코드가 프로미스나인도 그렇고 아이즈원도 큐티섹시(?)하고 걸크러쉬 한 곡을 컨셉으로 잡은것 같아 확실히 CJ계열이라 뮤비퀄리티도 좋고 기대가 됩니다.
