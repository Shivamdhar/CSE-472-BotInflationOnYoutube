However, I started seeing a Sports Psychologist 2 years ago as I advanced from the youth to adult level and found so much clarity in the understanding of my own mental psyche, and how to control it to respond appropriately to pressure situations. \n\nI later used these experiences from seeing the Sports Psychologist into my eSports career as well, captaining a team of nobodies into finishing 4th in a gaming league out of 24th, an achievement considering no one gave us a chance to finish out of the bottom 5.

Also why is a rare gold pack which is 25k coins or 500 fifa points and a premium gold players pack that is also worth 25k coins or 350 fifa points when they have the same coin value according to ea\n\nJust to add in a mega pack which costs 35k coins or 700 fifa points you have a 4.5% chance of a 87+ rated player and a 1.9% chance of a scream card but in a 45k pack or 600 fifa points you get a 4% chance of a 87+ rated and a 1.8% chance of a scream card it's not a big difference but why is the 45k pack 10k more when it is 100% worse yet the mega pack is more fifa points but less coins\n\ni really hope you see this nep considering this is a first owner road to glory packs are a big part of the series and i think this is a good talking point keep up the great vids nep and i hope your family is good and well\n\nthis formula / theory can be applied to just about every pack type", 'Tudor-Alexandru »òcraba': "Neppo, get Renato Augusto, he is a dirty disguisting OP CM.

This weekend league, (my first Weekend League of FIFA 19) I only just scraped silver 1 in my last game of the Weekend League. I needed 2 wins from 10 to secure silver 1 and only just got it. However at one point I was around the 9-14 record due to a few disconnects, I then came up against 2 top 100 players in my last 5 games.
