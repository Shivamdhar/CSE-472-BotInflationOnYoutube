haya busha	The best phone they made was the oneplus 3t after that all shit
Samir Hasan	Rocking the 3T still and going strong, I absolutely love it l, gonna upgrade to the 7t. Gonna make my parents upgrade to the 6T, they are still going with the Note 5 and S6- much improvement for most average users!

Prashanth Kamalanathan	GOOGLE FEED..Introduce that on the phone OnePlus
Archoka Deconat	awesome
Bryce Ford	Dear One Plus, Please please drop the Dash Charge and move to Quick Charge. Even if Dash is slightly superior, there is enough confusion between non-tech types about different amperage in USB blocks without having to explain multiple types of fast charging. Also, being able to fast charge with the laptop usb-c charger I already carry around that can Quick Charge any other big name Android phone on the market would be pretty sweet.  Other than that, I love the product, particularly the quick updates and pure android experience.
Ankit Sangeet	How did you got the navigation bar? Somebody please help. I am on 5T
B.S Legends	I need to wallpaper name please :)

PANCAKER KING	Just wish I could have it on Verizon.
nshusa A	looks really nice :) and that price wow.... rip other phones :O
Dan Loosen	Saw you have the Tesla app installed. Any chance you know how it would work as the Bluetooth key for a Model 3? Current phone doesn't like that much...
Michael Jordan	*Victor* *Oladipo* , where is your coverage for the Samsung foldable display?
Chris Story	First idk why anyone would thumbs down your videos XD. 2nd ty yet again for delivering the facts and straight to the point. Love the attention to detail you put into it. 3rd I've always wanted an OP device since the 3/3t with being on verizon it's a slim amount of options (currently rocking the axon 7) i will be buying my 6t. Quick question though, did you use the 6 ram or 8 for your daily experience?
Matamando Kalilani	Please drop a Link to this Wallpaper... Instagram : @code.the.dream
Joe Percy	Wireless charging is extremely overrated honestly.
Ameya Hegde	What is the new battery? 4:30
sean626262	Honestly, I'll ditch the headphone jack for a bigger battery any day.
Daniel's Channel	Bought it!
Rodrigo de Faria	Do I need to press the button and after unlock the screen? I didn't like this
Weilun Qin	Pete use your video in the Oneplus 6t China launch event lol.

William Valentine	I‚Äôm not interested in any phone but the iPhone. I only watch because MKBHD makes awesome YouTube videos.

Sholem Odai	video looks like a film
ReaperStrainX	This is definitely my next phone. Especially at this price point.
Sabbir Sam	I want ur wallpaper mate Can u give me the link/photo anyhow?
Fox Kids 2001	why in the seven hells would you buy a pixel  3 xl with $900 when you can buy a one 6t with 550$ that has twice more ram,  better body to screen ratio and it's almost notchless?
max demon	I think ..that google pixel company should stop making new phones because  OnePlus has made its new improvement  and its now more better...powerful,,,,amazing looks ...so thy should learn from then ...plz google people learn from them ;;;;;;;;;
potato aim	0:49 Can anyone give a link to the wallpaper on the PC?
Thom van Loon	Which calender app is he using as a widget?
dietcokezeros	If it weren‚Äôt for the bigger battery it‚Äôd be a downgrade.
Nick Bu	I wonder if you use the vibration touch feedback? Cuz the vibration motor on the 6T feels do bad
Abhishek Hegde	I wish that was my phone. But 40k is a lot for me :'(
Lynn Johnson	Will this work with Straight Talk in the U.S.?
Harish Gautam	when will OnePlus 5 get Android P??
Nitin Ramakrishna	Can you give me the link where u took that matrix back case
YouTube Zone	Amazing features by One Plus 6t
ryan o'sullivan	I've waited to buy, but the lack of waterproofing and the removal of the headphone jack....¬†with UK pricing I've decided to get the note8
Athan Hilaki	Anyone recorded any videos from concerts? Is the mic distorting?  I have been using OnePlus 5 and it has the best audio recording I have seen, no audio distortion even in the loudest environment.  Anyone knows how is the 6T?
Dylan White	Picked up the OnePlus 6T this week and I'm pretty dam happy with it. They only downside is the camera app is lacking in settings and options.
Logan Barney	What weather app does Marques open at 1:01? Is it a OnePlus stock weather app? It looks great.
Manjunath C R	This is by far the worst negatively biased video from MKBHD. Marques, you're losing your cool.
Rishab Nag	Hy can u send me ur wallpaper or tell me where i get this wallpaper please i like ur wallpaper reply me ASAP
Jesus himself	The removal of the headphone jack is just retarded
StephyWephy	I'm ordering this phone tonight... I'm so excited to finally use a phone I like the OS on so i don't have to run a launcher!
JITHU G	Premium phones are getting cheaper and cheaper phones are getting more premium. But oneplus slowly going to higher price range. If lg could come up with a better battery life and a slightly good OS then one plus will feel the heat. G7 is a very good example.
Vijaykumar Vijay	ü§£üòÇ He he all phones copied from apple
Alex Aguirre	Does he ever give away the phones??
tom	shame the camera isn't that good :/ otherwise everything about this phone is really great
Atul Lall	NEVER EVER buy a OnePlus phone. They're garbage. The quality control is awful & the customer service is even worse!  I bought a OP 5T & roughly 10 days after I received it, the entire display assembly separated from the phone's frame/body. Turns out the back frame was warped & the glue for the screen failed. This also allowed moisture/dirt to get inside the phone. What's worse is I was in the hospital for a major surgery and what thought to be cancer at the time I received the phone. Oneplus customer service was awful and did nothing for me. They refused to replace the phone & wanted me to send papers and personal documents to prove I was in the hospital. They spent 4 months arguing with me via email &  even had employees lie to me about being a supervisor. They refused to honor the warranty they caused me so much stress when I was trying to recover from major surgery & biopsies.   It took 6 months to get then to agree to at least repair the phone & after I sent the phone to them, they rescinded the offer to fix the phone and argued with me for another 2 months. They even actually kept my device and wouldn't send it back to me! I paid for that device and I own all its hardware, so Oneplus basically STOLE my property.  A new phone should never have such issues. It was never dropped or anything. I also found several forums where many other people had the same issue dating all the way back to the OnePlus 1.  To make things even worse, the OnePlus website was hacked and they didn't realize the breach for 3 months! My credit card info was stolen from when I purchased my phone and I had several fraudulent charges on my credit card. Can imagine having major surgery and worrying about if you have cancer  or not and then having to deal with BS like this all over a phone!  OnePlus is horrible company and does not deserve your business or hard earned money. In order to have the prices Oneplus does, they have to cut corners in certain areas. Yes, when the phone worked it was great, but just wait  until something goes wrong with your device and you need some help or service and you'll see just how bad of a company Oneplus really is. People forget that it's not just about the physical product, the customer service and ethics of a company really matters too. Chinese companies are shady and everything that comes out of China is questionable at best. Buy Chinese/Oneplus products at your own risk!
Herminio Gonzalez	Wallpaper
Deny the Zeitgeist	If Apple had priced the XR like this it would be killer. However, this phone is KILLER.
Javier Alvear	Anybody know what App is that weather widget? also the transparent widget/app calendar? Thanks!
Tim Blair	No manufacturer who leaves out the headphone jack is getting my business. What about those of us who value functionality over skinniness? The LGV40 and the Note 9 are looking really good right now.
Matei Ovidiu	Hey everyone. Can somebody tell me if a OP ordered in the Usa, will work in Europe?
ydc90	Would you recommend buying the OnePlus 6T over a pixel 2xl?  I currently use a pixel XL and totally love it. But would like to move to a bigger screen. The pixel just works an does everything it needs to bring buttery smooth, I want to ensure I keep the same moving to my next phone.
Izhar ul Haq Izhar ul Haq	Goodüòéüòé

sushiebar	4:24   annoh-ing
LazyGibbon	Now the big question for me is: Is the headphone jack adapter any good or is the audio a lot worse than on a normal headphone jack?
3ds Max Maximum	Nope not sexy as Galaxy S edge infinity series..edge display one of its own kind..
ludwing ardon	when watching YouTube on it why are you unable to get full screen while in any other video app it takes up the entire screen. While on YouTube it cuts off right around where the fingerprint sensor is.
Ryan Hamilton	You know what, after using a phone with a notch for a while and still hating it, I gotta say the notch on the 6t looks sexy
Aravind Pujari	i wish you could get your hands on asus zenfone 5z !!!
Watermelon Pie	I mean I've never needed to plug my earphones in while my phone was charging so I'm fine.
happensq1	Aside from the sad removal of the headphone jack, one plus is still making great phones for prices that aren't too expensive. Good job, but I really wish for the return of the jack. Either way, I am considering switching from this s8 to this phone, although I am also waiting for the s10 to come out.
Han Real Tech	No major change, like a meh upgrade is more like it
Siew Hing Lam	What would you recommend between s9 plus and 6T? I am currently using s9 plus but thought of switching to 6T.
Wonderment	Don't know why I even bother checking out comment sections, haters gonna hate. You'd think I'd have that ingrained into me by now..

Logical Goldfish	I have the OnePlus 5T and was considering upgrading to the 6T but after watching this video, I will be waiting until the 7T comes out and hope they bring back the headphone jack and physical fingerprint reader in the back.
Wang Hung	I heard you can't stream Netflix in HD with this? Wtf?
EpyonRoyal	My LG G6 has a broken headphone jack, and I only used it 3 times.  smdh
Tony Tigah	Will not buy now with no headphone jack.
Jem Walker	I'll miss the headphone jack cos I'm a big believer in the principle that keeping some low-fi legacy tech in these things makes them more reliable and rugged in the long run, but I can see why they felt that it wasn't worth keeping given that it's already been pretty much condemned by apple. that aside, this phone looks truly awesome. I especially love the fingerprint sensor; even if it's still a tad slow, a sensor built into the screen is pure sci-fi porn.
Lillian espinoza	I love your  reviews especially the nitpicking very important thank you I'm going to check out this phone  keep up your good  words  üëçüíì
Daniel H	Does it actually work on Verizon? I've seen that it does data but no calling or texting.
Max	to big :( Bring the 5" phone back
Philipp Sesar	Is it still your daily driver?
Sale a Cell	Got to try it now.
Andrew Harper	ill save up this month and next month ill get this one
Antonio Randolfi	Does the brightness is maximised only in the area of fingerprint scanner or in the whole screen? I did't know that it was possibile to increase brightness only in specific areas on amoleds
Little Pako	Question. You should also add into your reviews how camera and audio work when recording at a concert or something. I use my phone a ton at shows and always looking for what each new phones has to show on that.
Rd Kannan	Hai.. i m from INDIAüáÆüá≥  I like ur all videos man..  Do u celebrate DIWALI festival in your country??

Kanishk Dudeja	No mention of the phone not having wireless charging and water proofing?
MrDannyloco	no headphone jack is an instant killer for me, i would rather have the finger print on the back
Luke Szeflinski	so is camera on pixel 3 xl really worth it to get it over oneplus 6T?
Vivek Panchmatiya	i hate it when the phone gets narrow and slimer it really is not fun to use narrow and slim and tall that is not a phone what should be i think 6 was better coz it had a wide screen. Narrow screen may look good but is not a fun to use
divyal dhande	Color do rad
Light Pancakes	Damn the op6/6t  is such a fine budget flagship for the amazing hardware/software it carries. Too bad I went the Nokia 7 Plus cuz I couldn't resist it for its heavily discounted price. Still happy with my choice but I loath for an OLED screen. Android 9.0 battery consumption sucks here compared to 8.1 ‚òπÔ∏è.
1 2	I was gonna get this... but no headphone jack. Listen to music at work. Most small wireless earphones only has 6 hours... then I gotta unplug n plug my wired in.. :/ so I guess I m going Samsung.

Levis Young	I wonder why doesnt marques brownlee doesnt like to do reviews on Sony phones while I think they are more to some other phones,some of us are Sony fans and we follow and subscribe we would really love to hear how our products company is doing my thoughts tho
kanishk Agarwal	Watching this on OnePlus 6t great video quality mkbhd can I get a üíì..
Home Phone	I was able to get past no headphone jack on iphone 8plus , so I'm cool with out it because with that dongle I can still connect my wired headphones and enjoy my music

Manasseh Akshay	How many speakers does the one plus 6T has??   @MKBHD
Manoj manu	Realme 2 pro
Jose Rodriguez	Hey ya'll I need some help. Would you all think it's a good idea to trade in my Galaxy s8+ for this 6T phone? T-mobile has a deal right now where if I trade in a participating phone (which my s8+ is), I'll get the 6T at 50% off, which means I'll get $300 dollars for my S8+. What do you all think? Is an S8+ worth more than $300 on the used market today, or is it a good deal from Tmobile?
Christin mathews	Can you buy me one because I am using a 20 dollar right now so please please please please
Jerry Lange	your video was the 9th on the list when i searched for oneplus 6t :(

Quagmire	is this phone worth to upgrade from a note 5? I know my phone is pretty old üòî
SoCalSlaughter	Display is to narrow. I want a wider screen. Also, I will never own a phone with a notch.

A I	Does it support augmented reality? How much is it?
POORGAMER	Why dont you Upload 720P-4K 60FPS videos
Imran Ali	The wallpaper looks awesome. Send me link for download?
Ragesh G.R	You need to bring the phone to lock screen  before using the in screen finger print scanner. The rear physical scanner was so much better
Praveen Kumar	Does it have a Face Unlock Feature Or not
I am Hannah Montana	I want the V40 and a headphone jack but the 6T is waaay cheaper and has more storage

Ryan	Currently have the iPhone 5s which is beyond slow now... I was planning on getting the 6 in hopes that I could buy one for a cheaper price after the 6t launch, but now I don‚Äôt know. The 6t looks so nice!!!
Pamela	Yes I'm in the US just got mine yesterday at t mobile I'm loving it.
Prakash Kalandi	Hi
Aneeb Zulfiqar	No notification LED?
Imtiaj Uddin	Mkbhd do know eminem....good to know thay
Cem Yildiz	I mean after removing the headphone jack, is there really any reason left why you should buy a 6T?  If you are looking for a smartphone, just get Huawei or Samsung who are doing everything atleast as good as they are and the prices are getting closer now too..
Deepak Dhabhai	My 5T is still working except the charging cable. So I would stick with my phone
ElimRem	The 6T has a camera CUTOUT, not a notch. The original essential phone also had this. The iPhone X was the first to create the poorly designed notch.
Kiruthiga Udayakumar	Dose one+ comes with headphones ??? Then why will they have headphone jack...but it‚Äôs a good fone... *still using apple*
Muslim Mahmood	‚ÄúGoogle needs to UP their game significantly for the Pixel 4. They can't aim so low with what they released with the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. The hardware is terrible and the software is disappointingly slow for being THE flagship for Android. I mean, it's the phone released by the founding company for crying out loud. If Google can produce a phone with a display to bezel ratio like that of the Oneplus 6T and super quick speed, then it should solve A LOT of the issue right there.‚Äù ‚Äî @topher
–ò–≤–∞–Ω –õ–∞—Ä–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤	nah i'll stick to xiaomi, much cheaper phones, yet just as good for everything i need, and a better battery than most 500$+ phones. except camera, camera is hot garbage.
ahmed ali	I lost my phone couple days ago and it was Samsung s8 plus and i am open for new brand but i don't  Know should i get this phone or an i phone x max
blue15heart	My next phone
Kukiiishh	WHY ARE THEY FOLLOW THE STUPID TREND OF "NO JACK"!! üò°üò°üò°üò° ONE PLUS I EXPECT MORE FROM YOU!
Jon Devo	What youre headline really means is OnePlus screwed 1 million users who bought the same phone with fewer benefits less than six months ago. I know they've looked after you, but it's a shame to see you so compromised that you can't call them out for ditching their values as a brand.
KillBill Grill	I consider myself very lucky because I don't care about jack
hakan akdag	Great video. Great phone. I would buy it but i got so used to Samsung's features.
roomforthefiiixins	Fuck your notch and no headphone jack having ass. You sold out.
Mayur Sawant	No headphone jack. No wireless charging. The screen is bigger than the previous generation yet the PPI remains the same. I think the PPI should increase so that the images will be more crisper. No change in cameras. At least they should have provided a wide angle lens. The same technology is available in the phones which are priced less than this phone. And everytime the price goes up. Just hype nothing else.
liga316	Not my next phone
Mt R.	Audio jack butthurt comment compilation
Carlos Battousai	I've got the OnePlus 5T and I'm still really happy with it. so I'm not sure if it's worth it for me. However if my mom which has the first Nextbit Robin FINALLY get's sick of it I'll get this and hand her my Oneplus 5T.
Haryanvi BOY	plz make a camera comparision video
The Untimely Pumpkin	you're wearing casey's merch
Papai_AtDusk	It would be great without that notch
Nashor	Could you guys introduce us nubia X , i think its really good
Nate Palmer	Could the slowness in the fingerprint reader become faster with new software?
Element Finland	I want this but also no reason to get rid of my godly 5T :p
Sz Ki	Does it have dual speakers? And does it get louder than the S8 plus?  USB c but no wireless charging?
W≈Çodek 1410	Mi mix from 2016 i eating this crap on breakfast
AwesomeStuff	i was going to buy pixel 2 xl because of the price drop and because i was impressed with google assistant, To be honest the pricing on One plus 6t is making me change my mind......this looks amazing so far
Edward Noble	I ordered the OnePlus 6T. Never had one before, coming from an old Samsung and wanted a change. I thought I would be more upset about the headphone jack, but now I'm looking into USB-C DAC dongles and I'm kinda excited to see how that goes. Ordered 6 and will do a review of them all. I really like the fingerprint reader on the front again as I like unlocking my phone while it's on the desk. I also like the 1080p OLED screen. That seems like plenty in a phone anyway, even a 6.4" one. Looking forward to trying some widescreen space movies on that screen with perfect blacks! PS. Just subscribed to your channel, your videos are awesome Marques! Cool that you are into cameras and audio as well :).
Greed Homunculus	Where do you get your wallpaper? Thanks in adv üòÅ
VISION	definitely my next phone. cant wait to get rid of my iphone.
Poseid0n	After using an iPhone for about 3-4 years I made a change and pre ordered the Oneplus 6t recently. 1000$ for a phone is way too much. Very excited about the new opportunities.
aleksandar vujanic	This phone could be the best if OnePlus put stereo speakers and didn't remove headphone jack. Overall for that price it is great.
Tarun Wadhwani	one plus 6t or samsung note 8?
sorlino89	STOP USING NUMBERS TO COMPARE BATTERIES..... PLEASE STOP
Tekkerz Trident	I use my 2012 iPad all day, at least 7 hours, but I have at least 40% left when I'm done. Do you want to check it out?
LinoTata	Samsung is still the best.
han666	I believe it's the first he explicitly mentions in the video Dbrand is a sponsor. The regulars knew it but it was sneaky not to give a disclaimer in the past. He should also add that to the description as well.
Gur Preet	Got one plus 6t ad before this video
EveryThing Pro	i cant get a wallpaper u showed in this video,how to get it ?@mkbhd
Thank You Utube	I like one plus series
ankit ambilkar	no 3.5, stupid display FP, ugly notch, high price etc. Name should be One plus SHIT-T.
Mark Lozano	same price?
Miro Babic	I tested yesterday both op6 and op6t in the phone house. I like more One plus 6 with headphone jack and better display.
MetalPowerPanos	I always love one plus projects now they took it to a next level.... I think that this device will be my next one .... I love it üòä also I love your work and that you mention all the stuff about the phones
FaNg ym	Almost every tech youtuber is generous to give complements on one plus, however in real life I didn't see many crowds using it.weird
M F	He's annoyed by the finger print bright animation but not the small speaker?! Am I seriously the only one that freaking cares about the speakers üò§
Prathyu mnan	Thank u man and I've bought this cool phone
SpecOps 121	No headphone Jack, no deal
Albert Suantak	Is it just me or teardrop notch (on any phone) looks ugly/tacky?
The Gecko	R.I.P the jack Only LG,Samsung,Song and some Nokias still value it

Mus	Hey Marques how are you? I'm currently using the LG V30. Do you think oneplus 6T is an upgrade from the v30?
Tse Hong Ling	i think people will stop talking about the 3.5mm audio jack if headphone makers start to make USB-C headphones, and if Apple also moved to USB-C, then the world will just start using USB-C earphones for smartphones, PC, laptops etc and 3.5mm will just fade away, though it will take some time.
Saurabh Soman	Really helpful ‚úåÔ∏è
DMITRI CHAN	Oneplus 6t compare to huawei mate 20 pro which one is better?
Sajith Mantharath	What is the aspect ratio of this video? Why?  Looks wider.
Narapoia1	Very happy I got the 6. With a screen this size having the fingerprint reader on the front is awkward - even if you have large hands. I don't want to spend a ton of money on tinny shitty bluetooth headphones that have to be recharged or dongles.    Interesting that it's the same price - but to be honest I would still choose the 6.
addictedtorap	i was i thought aboubt buying the one+ 6, but on their website it was out of stock. Then I saw the launch event of the 6t and decidet to wait for one month, until the phone was finally there. Now, that is for the same price, I instantly bought it, and I am looking forewoard to getting it!
Oscar Nilsson	I really dont see why peaople are hating on the removal of the headphone jack so much... like damn get a pair of wireless headphones for like 50 bucks
Donnie Hosein	Picked one up, i'll give it a shot to see how well it works on Verizon..will be hiding the notch... at least with notch hidden, it still uses the screen space for notifications and doesn't just drop everything down. Pay attention google.
plutube	Were do you find these nice backgrounds on your phones?
Kevin Bailey	Great video.
Assassian Wolf	I‚Äôm tossing up between this phone or the iPhone 7. Would someone be able to help me out?
Fanta Orange	No headphone jack???? Not getting it
Aliyu Abba Baba Ari	The way he says "annoying"
Lags4you	For $280 with Tmobile $300 trade-in. Best phone I have purchased. I use wireless headphones and Bluetooth in the car. No headphone jack was not a big deal. Water resistant??? I don't swim with my phone. Wireless charging??? I returned that thing after 1 week. So far a great phone for me.
Efyuu	I had a problem with my oneplus 6, when i record music with snapchat its sounds horrible, how's it with this 6t?
Riddler	I have a Oneplus 3T,Very happy after 3+ years of using it.
Marlon Jefferson	Top reviewer this guy
SmileyIronMan	Does is support Wireless Charging tho?
Kelvin KMS	Really ? Do you have to click power button to use fingerprint scanner ?¬†It is not even better than traditional fingerprint scanner.

Shaaz Hafiz	Please send me this wallpaper.
Viktor Chemelekov	Heads UP everyone: If you go and buy this phone from TMobile and you're not on their postpaid plan, the $579 version of the One Plus 6t WILL COST YOU ANOTHER $40+. In fact even if you've been their customer for years, but have a prepaid plan with them it will still cost you extra. Just FYI that's $40 + tax you pay for a locked phone that will support one SIM card instead of two and you will be at the mercy of the "Uncarrier" for software updates. Ye be warned.
Matt Dixon	Some day on next year: "your phone got earphone jack? Ughh clearly not premium enough"
Calum Atkinson	I've had and hopefully will have my 5T for a while, and i'm really happy about that, i love the finger print reader on the 5t and wasn't a fan of the smaller one on the 6 or this screen-based one on the 6t. And I would really still like an aux personally. At this point i don't even mind the notch and improved battery is good(though it already seems fantastic on the 5t let alone the 6 and 6t). I guess I hope either the 7 or 7t manages to keep improving but finds a way to have a more 5t-style fingerprint reader and an aux.
Fortnite Nigga420	$550....I mean...gotta think about it
Daniel Viorel	Does anyone knows how you can use the fingerprint sensor for apps (like banking apps) that support fingerprint authentication?  because I saw that after login with the fingerprint you can't really use it anymore.
Aidan Hegarty	Is it ip rated/ waterproof
Amethyst752	I'm all in
Karthik Ganapathi	The youtube video format looks odd , kinda stretched out . ü§î
Rahul Chawla	Remember how people got paranoid about risk of fingerprints being shared by Apple and Apple clarified that fingerprints are stored locally only? How about OnePlus and Vivo? ü§î
Esivo	So, the 6T or the Pixel 3?
GOT ME LIKE!!!	I am tired of this shit I am getting an Iphone
brycealonso	I just switched to this phone from iPhone X. And as a sales associate for sprint. I must say. This phone is everything you need and more. Losing the headphone jack isn't a huge deal to me as I lost that a while ago. The screen panel looks rich in color and responds beautifully. I personally never loved face ID in the I iPhone s. So not having those sensors to me is a bonus. The front camera gets the job done. As with the rear. The phone is light and easy too handle for medium hands. This phone is my main computing device all around. I do have a iPad and MacBook. But I spend 80% of my time on my phone and hence my phone needs to be super snappy to be enjoyable. This phone is it. Now I need to get as much life out of it as possible. Do these things last longer than a year? What's the catch?
Farzeen Rais	Watching on my brand new op 6t üòâ
Surya Prakash	If we put some screen guard on phone so does this fingerprint work?
Rohan Raina	Can anyone please explain how OnePlus has addressed privacy concerns including the management of app data and personal information? My only major concern is that OnePlus will not collect and store user data properly.
CORXL KEEF AKUMO	That  notch pun
Parag Bandewar	Screen unlock using camera works really well on my oneplus 6. I hardly use fingerprint scanner.  But I use 3.5 mm a lot - with my office headphones,  - with my car's AUX cable.  - I don't want to carry that converter with me. Removing 3.5 mm for in display fingerprint scanner is a bad idea I guess.
lmn xyz 000	Dude no one cares..!!
Tony Le	What's the name of the background if I may ask?
Dhruv Rajnish	Watching this on 6T feels greatüòç
Sam Valentine	I dont know whether to get the one plus 6t or the p20 pro? help
lilTitan	No headphone jack no buy, I would have even forgive the notch being there because it is a slick looking phone but no.
Riya Varma	Wouldn‚Äôt use this even if someone gifted it to me
Salvatore Cicciarella	I couldn't help notice that you're wearing an Apple watch. Mine is currently sitting on the shelf. I've moved from Apple to OnePlus. Any word on if Apple will finally allow Android connectivity? Love the watch, and couldn't be happier after grabbing a OP5T as my daily driver.
Jerry Spaghetti	They also got rid of the headphone jack because they made a vote on who uses wireless or wired headphones and the majority of people were using wireless so that is another reason they took it out.
Kumar Mitrabhanu	Any thoughts on honor magic 2?
rahat xadik	Sir give ur wallpaper link
Norm Fields	I tried the first One+ 1 and it was a great piece of hardware with a horrible OS. I‚Äôm seriously thinking of giving the 6T a try.

Abhijith S	Someone tell me where to get that wallpaper?
Kevin P	looks like a great phone, I have at&t and I know that if the phone was made for Tmobile that it is compatible. I am wondering though when you use a phone that a carrier does not sell, do you lose some functionality?   I had heard that you will not connect at LTE but will only get 4G for instance.
vaibhav singh	YOU CANT MAKE EVERYTHING WIRELESS....MUSIC HAS ITS OWN QUALITY WHEN IT IS WIRED.......I USE 3T BUT SERIOUSLY AFTER THIS UPGRADE I WONT PREFER ONEPLUS
CH Steele	With Christmas coming if they would run a 200.00 off I might buy it do they warranty it in America now?  What is amazing is American cell companies are stuck on using the same companies with slow cpu's and won't venture away from those same slow brands when looking at this they make a better product without an Apple branding on it kuddos to ONE PLUS for keeping it real
VJ	thinking of replacing my iPhone X with it. Worth it ?
SaGe Pixatic	Gonna Buy It Today Or Tomorrow
Shawn Sapp	Yeah I'm gonna trade in my 3t for this.
The Tech Temple	I like the tear drop shape. Gives the phone less of a boxy look. Also, T-Mobile has a 50% off trade in deal going on.
Pancake Lizard	2:57 That's a pretty fast fingerprint reader!

Akshansh Shrivastava	No jack no buying
wendywanda	1:40 looks so nice
erik heijink	LG is still doing well! love them
Lakshmi Kota	To experience in display finger print sensor, power button needs to be pressed and if the face unlock is already configured what makes sense to 'press power button' to unlock phone with fingerprint having configured the face unlock? Then it does the job right?! Its nonsense to 'press power button' to unlock with fingerprint.

321Brandon	Does anyone know if the speaker on the front is just for call audio or if it works with the bottom speakers for a "dual speaker" type of thing?
Ivor Davies	I wonder how long it will take Apple to move to in-screen fingerprint readers in iPhones?
oRIZinal beatz	Okay so is this better than the g7 or v40 cause I'm choosing out of the 3..
Andre Antoine	Pick up the one plus 6 yesterday definitely fast .. I love it so far
Ken Anderson	This is probably the best "bezeless" display out currently design wise. Give it the folded bottom of the iphone and it's probably the closest we get to absolute bezeless. I'm not a fan of the moving parts for hidden front camera and under screen stuff isn't full fleshed so this is great.

sifa mayira luc didier	Big up MK

Carbon Catalyst	Watching this on my iPhone 6. The last iPhone with a headphone jack. (Excluding the S) I‚Äôm really tempted for the OnePlus 6t... but I‚Äôd have to upgrade to the 6. I need that headphone jack
PROJECT :	At the beginning, I thought 1+ would wait until the next Snapdragon processor came out to launch this 6T revision. As far as I remember, the 5 has a SD 821 and the 5T has a 835; then the 6 has a 845‚Ä¶ well.

Maximum667722	I don't know if the animations are there to illuminate the area required for the fingerprint reader. I think it's just that circle of green light directly underneath the finger that matters. I imagine if oneplus turned off the surrounding animation the issue would be solved as your finger would be covering the only part that's lit up and necessary. Am I wrong?
Santiago Grilli	Nope, not my next phone but definitely sticking to oneplus from the op6
Calvin Bond	I'm a big fan (you and OnePlus) but did you say it don't have a notification light?
Aditya Vardhan Gundla	This 18:9 aspect ratio video really looks bad! Can you revert back to original please?
David Maldonado	Pricing on the Pixel went up this year, pricing on anything Apple is completely insane, and Pricing on the Samsung phones is just too damn high. I've got a superior phone with the Pixel 2 currently, but I'm going to trade it in for one of these. Why? To show my support for the maker, and tell the rest of the Phone Manufacturers that their pricing schemes are becoming unreasonable.

Cosmin Margarit	The 6T looks amazing, and the under-display fingerprint scanner is really cool, but I wonder how it would work in applications that are locked or require a fingerprint scan to log in. If you open your online banking app for example and requires a fingerprint scan, how that would work on 6T? Will the area on the display reserved for fingerprint activate and only work for reading your fingerprint or it will press any button that happens to be on that area of the screen?
nucleuspower	I own a oneplus 6 and I love it. I don't think the 6T is worth the upgrade.
R Œû D B L Œõ Z Z Œû 7	better than the Pixel 3 don't judge me on this.
GM 79	If Apple or Google came up with that phone, they would call it revolutionary phone, best ever forever and ever, ever phone. Apple n Google are way behind. But i know, they can do it, but don't wanna jump that fast because what are they gonna do next year...they give you better phone every year but not that much better, just as much as they can to make you want to buy one, not me, you. :)

Skyler Cooper	I refuse to ever buy a phone that ships without a headphone jack.

Martin J	Should i Buy Samsung s9 or oneplus 6t if the s9 is about 50-60$ more
Majestic Inc.	Wallpaper?
Delvin Mack	I do have a quick question about the fingerprint reader. From all the videos I've seen of the 6T, it looks like one has to press the power button to turn on the screen and then place the thumb on the reader. Is that really the case? It seems to me that it adds an extra step each time just to unlock your phone. With my current phone, all I have to do is put my finger on the sensor and it unlocks.   Can anyone confirm this? Thanks.
AJ S	Not a fan of the on screen finger print scanner. I liked it on the back.  No headphone jack? WHAT!!  RIP oneplus. Samsung?? HELL NO!!   LG it is.
hiram esquivel	I like it but notch killed it for me even if you can hide it still bothers me that its their
Yasir Abdulmunem	Really good phone and stupid fast. Charges really quick. I have been using Apple for the last 4 years and this thing is a real flagship killer. On TMobile Jump 24$/month  OnePlus  6t vs 40$/month for the iPhone xs. Save almost 200$ per year and get the OnePlus. I would highly recommend it
isaac flores	Really wanted to buy this but no headphone jack really is what stopping me , thank god the note 9 still has a headphone jack ill probaly get that but i still have my note8 tho
Peter K	Funny no one mentions the differences between the T-Mobile version and the one sold by one plus. There's enough of a difference where I already want to return my T-Mobile version
Bryen Graver	Just got it today from T-mo. It's dope. I know I'll miss that headphone jack, I really will, but it checks off big boxes in so many areas for so much less money.
ghost	Android phones are always so complicated while iPhones are just simple !
Chris Dennis	Please do a review for the Blu Vivo 11+.. Thanks for all the great content!

Morten Helmert	Can someone explain why the price is higher in Denmark? I don't know about other countries but it confuses me that Marques stats that it's the same starting price and I guess that's how it is in the US. But why did it get more expensive in Denmark? Isn't that a bit unfair?
Niranjan Niranjan s	can you review Nubia X
Man of steel	Plainly speaking don't go for the next one plus model until they release the T model of the same model
binhonz	For me is getting to that time when I change phones but can't find one with front facing speakers anymore. Plus, ZTE has not yet released the new version of my current phone, the Axon 7. In my humble opinion, the speakers are such a cool thing to have. Why manufacturers don't push more if it? I don't really get this thing bazels trend.
David Karon	No wireless charging, not waterproof, and no micro SD card?     Disappointing.

Squaley	Where's the best place to purchase the 6t
Shane Allen	The Samsung S10 is removing the headphone Jack too. We just have to get used to it now. It's the sacrifice we're making for more bezel and better tech.  Just buy the "bullet wireless" from OnePlus and you're good to go. They sound amazing.

Rakesh Venkat	No headphone jack, and the front fingerprint sensor are two important reasons I would not upgrade my one plus 6 to this one. Quite disappointing : (
rhythm451	Dnt know y everyone complaining, always loved the headphone jack but never really used it every time I get in my car it's always bluetooth...not to mention some of the best headphones in the market are wireless. And tbh was never a fan of finger print scanners on back of phones. 3t was one of the best phones from OnePlus and I loved the front facing finger print scanner and now they brought that design back. And really people weren't some of u the same one's that were complaining about the rear finger print scanners when phones started shifting over to tht design? Seems like all u guys do is complain üòíüòî
Almir Bido	Is there a notification light or not at all?
Lloyd Tony	LED indicator?
Onat guzel	As a Oneplus 6 user, I wouldn't change my phone even if they offered for free. If you're planning on buying Oneplus just stick to the 6. That onscreen fingerprint sensor is just nonsense. Removing the jack for battery and the sensor is not worth it when there is this thing called the dash charge.

GunbusterDX	USB-C dock with a headphone jack. Why. Does. Nobody. Make. One. ?
Rafail TR	Why is all the people crying that they remove the headphone jack? ~First of all you can still connect your headphones because there is something called type C converter to jack(it comes with the phone in the box)YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT ~They removed it so they can add new features and bigger battery ~This is not One plus 7 is 6T which means is 6 with some extra features and changes if you don't like then simply buy 6 ~You can buy Bluetooth Headphones in the year 2018 which you will find more useful and more comfortably  ~The headphone jack is dying get over it most mobile phone companies removed it so is about time for a change ~Also you can buy headphones with type-C connector if don't really don't want Bluetooth headphones

I occasionally use Bluetooth headphones and if I need to use wired connection I can just use the dongle. Ordered the 6t (am switching from Apple) am looking forward to using android again after a few years of using the Apple ecosystem.

Allen Bryant	What about updates? Will it be at carrier pace or something faster?
el self	Apple and Samsung fans are you watching this video :)
Charlie Edgington	Thanks for a good overview ... my conclusion: disappointed. Why? Losing the headphone socket,  bringing notch size down from OnePlus 6 is alright but did not need to do it, front screen is a gimmick versus the very good OnePlus 6 unlock on the back - in fact (as I read reviews) it could as irritating as the iPhone 6 fingerprint button which is always needing a reset... and it is going to be irritatingly bright! Camera changes coming to OnePlus 6 for main camera so no real gain here. Bigger battery seems to be the only real gain here. This is clearly a small improvement and I wanted them to get their cameras up to compete the top of the market. That would seal it!

Certain Things	i wouldn‚Äôt mind if the headphone jack was on the top. i wouldn‚Äôt mind if the phone was slighty thicker (considering if they did so they could get rid of the camera bump) BUT NO. JUST NO. NO AUDIO JACK. Great. After bashing other companies, & saying their promise of keeping their audio jack, they now get back the bashing of losing the audio jack. But I still love OnePlus. But just don‚Äôt talk trash & keep a great promise (especially for long) if you can‚Äôt keep it.

CaptainCoolpants101	Loving all these features... But I really hate the fact that you have to wake the screen up with the power button first, then tap the screen or wait for face unlock.  Why not just skip the middleman and put the fingerprint reader in the power button itself? Its just faster, and easier for 1 handed operation as you don't have to move your hand around as much. Other companies have done it, so I know it can be done. Phones will always need a power button, so a real fingerprint reader can always be present. These underscreen readers are cool, but totally unnecessary, and according to oneplus, took up the space for the headphone jack.
Aston Mathew	Hey MB which one is more value for money ? Poco F1 or 6t?
shivam sharma	poco f1 ad on one plus 6t videoüòÇ
Robert Luten	I always like to compare these reviews with my own phone and when you mentioned the battery I thought the one plus would beat my Nokia 7 plus (which has a headphone jack) but you said you had almost 6 hours of screen time which is already impressive but my record with the Nokia is 6hrs45minutes of screen time on a full charge and it‚Äôs pretty consistent in this. Considering I only paid ‚Ç¨320 for it I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty good. It also runs on Android pie since it‚Äôs an Android one device

Dev Nath	The good thing is the new design of the notch.  OnePlus offers good software optimisations. That‚Äôs it. Other than that it just copies Samsung and Apple. I mean look at the Note 9. 4000mAh battery, a jack, waterproof design. Its all there.  The in-display scanner is not at all worth the sacrifice. Its slow. Hope Samsung and Apple refine the in-display tech in future.  Till then pass on this phone and get some other phone.

Razey	I'll admit, I was pissed off when OnePlus announced they were removing the headphone jack. But now that I think about it, it's honestly not that bad.   This phone has great specs and cost a lot less than other flagship phones. While you can't listen and charge at the same time,  you can purchase a cheap pair of wireless earphones or the upcoming OnePlus Type-C earphones.    I seriously doubt you are charging and listening all the time, and with a larger battery life and quick charging, it's not a bad compromise.   In my opinion, I think this trend of having no headphone jack on phones are becoming more prevalent and sooner or later, all the big companies will soon scrap it.

Astro Boom	Fingerprint under the screen has 0 interest, put it back, +1 for the battery upgrade.
IWolfy Woke	Thanks for the v8 palm at the end XD
Aitilolxd	BEST OF TE IPHONES
Dean Buttry	Am I the only one that thinks the finger print reader is a step back?  Yeah it's cool and all but the best location for a fingerprint reader is the back, where it was on the Oneplus 6..... I know it it mostly personal preference but the people I've had conversations with over the years have hated finger print readers on the front.  When LG moved theirs to the back it was like heaven, and I was glad almost everyone else followed suit.  Hated TouchID on the front of the iPhones I had, and really thought they should have put one on the back of the X instead of the slow and inconsistent FaceID.  I an a fan of OnePlus products, I've owned three of them so far, but the fingerprint reader just seems more like a gimmick to say they look at us and the in display reader then actually being functional.
Jerry Reyes	this is the only notch design that is acceptable
Irshad Bagdadi	If upgrading from 1+3T to 1+6T, I would always say yes to that kind of upgrade

Silence ‡¥µ‡µÄ‡¥°‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µã	Hi sr
Martin L√©vesque	Do you own a Model 3 or you still have your Model S? Because you never talk about the bluetooth reliabilities of the phones you tests. I own a Model 3 and a Galaxy 4 (I want to change it) and the bluetooth on the Galaxy is not working super great with my car. I was wondering if the Galaxy s9, OnePlus 6T or other android phones had good bluetooth.

Rowdyy Ronnie	So, you need to first press the power button to wake the device up and then touch the screen to unlock the device. How is it better than fingerprint unlock method? So now I have to press power button twice (lock and unlock) instead of one. Wow! What an improvement!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Aryaraj Banerjee	The Note 9 has that huge S-Pen, a bigger battery, wireless charging, MicroSD Card support, dual speakers and IP68 water and dust-resistant AND has a headphone jack!  No excuse, OnePlus! üôÑ
I Don't Know	The screen unlock thing on the screen is really cool, but I think I still prefer the scanner on my 5t.  It's super fast and easy to use. I also use my headphone jack pretty often while I'm charging... Still cheering the brand on though.

Sagar Kamat	Hey Marques, can you please find out about the TMobile variant about the 6T? Things like who will be managing the software updates, unlocking, bloatware etc? I have been a OP user since many years and love the phones for the speed and freedom. I fear having a carrier overlay would restrict a lot and change the experience.

betas4life	Still using OnePlus ONE, though it has started getting weared a while now. Had to replace battery after 3 yrs and now the LCD digitalizer went nuts leaving me a ~2cm non-responsive horizontal area in the middle of the screen aaand the magnesium sandstone housing is getting shuttered. Not to mention the software slowness and delayed response times...  OnePlus ONE was a great bargain back in the day with CM OS - but now I think the best bang for the money to upgrade is OnePlus 6T. I dont mind the loss of jack since they include the USB-C -> 3.5mm adapter in the box for free, the major thing is the battery improvement making me want a 6T over Xiaomi`s MI MIX 3 which is also DOPE.
Daniel Costache	1st world problems... camera notch, being annoyed by the screen light when you touch the finger print sensor, 2mm bezels... the only actual retarded thing is the no headphone jack trend...
jamaludeen ibrahim	is one +6t  better then not 9 please let me no.
Metaforically Speaking	Dude!! What's this ratio?
James Silkworth	Sold.  Decided on the 6T over the Pixel 3 XL.  Not really a selfie guy, so I''m good with a simple front camera.  Also rarely listen to audio through the phone speakers.  The look is so much better than the Pixel plus the better performance did it!

Vaibhav Shah	Yea...no headphone jack, not interested. Sad to see all the high end phones are following this bullshit trend started by CrApple. I remember when phones had removable batteries, headphone jack and were pretty durable to drops. THAT was quality design. Form following function. This here is pretty much function following form/aesthetics. Its bullshit. I guess I'll stick to low/mid range phones that have bezels (to protect my display) and headphone jack.

mukkaar	For phone I haven't found headphone jack necessay for long time. I really like my audio and I have sweet audio gear. But when I'm on move I just love convenience of bluetooth headphones. That said, I think laptops should have at least few ports: Couple usb-c, at least one regular usb and headphone jack.

vic3k515	Wait.. so you have to click power button first, before touching the screen with your finger? You usually do it (clicking power button and touching the screen) with the same finger, so its 2 times more things to do than with face recognition (just click power button). Or maybe you can unlock the phone with your finger when the ambient display is on? Is it possible to unlock the phone with a single touch when the phone is laying flat on a desktop (like with Touch ID)?

amirbahalegharn365	They said there is not a space for such headphone jack when we are using FOD, but we have "gionee m6 plus" with >6inch larger size with 60020mah battery and a very great thickness size(only 8.2mm) retaining 3.5mm headphone jack in 2015/2016, so why not in 2018, this kind of phone but with up-to-date top spec is not being built? there is even security chip(encryption hardware) in that phone too which reserve some more space for other hardware replacement
SRINIVASA REDDY	One Plus 6T is 38 K I am Not Intersted ...in This Price Segment LG Q7+ (6gb/128gb) Better 40k ..Wirless Charging and Water IP68 Rating   And Poco F1 is 21 k Best  One plus 6t No 3.5 jack and In Display finger Print And Water Drop Notch In This Thing 38 K Is Very Heavy Price....

Momo Hirai	People who complains about headphone jacks just need to move on with life. You guys are like some old people, unwilling to accept new technologies. You guys aren‚Äôt tech heads either, so gtfo from watching tech videos with your toxic ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm not buying or supporting Company X anymore because they suck and don‚Äôt have a headphone jack‚Äù. Quit whining.   Getting stucked in the past just because an old piece of tech isn‚Äôt present. If that‚Äôs the case you might as well just use an old phone from 10 years back, heck you might as well just use the old Nokia 3310, without any fingerprint or facial unlock, or anything in fact. Since you love your headphone jack so much.  Tech moves on and tech companies will too, with or without your purchases. That 3.5mm of space engraved inwards a phone really does waste a lot of space. If you‚Äôre a true tech head and look forward to new and innovative designs and feature, you wouldn‚Äôt mind something as insignificant as a headphone jack. That‚Äôs the reason why Bluetooth headphones are invented. Learn to move on, or just use your old phones without internet but has an headphone jack and go back to your ex-girlfriends if you‚Äôre unwilling to move on.
mypd1991	Hey so I don't know if this is already a thing but what if you could have a "completely" bezel-less phone? With the camera under the display and glass, using a kinda transparent display and 1 way mirror type backing. Maybe they could have a small part of screen wherever the camera is, be transparent (like with some kind of transparent display tech?) with a 1 way mirror type backing so the camera could still see through but you wouldn't be able to see the camera under the screen. There might be a difference in quality on that "small" portion of the screen where it would have to be transparent (if this is even possible), also there could possibly be some kinda of camera light interference from whatever color the display is emitting mixing with the color the camera is intaking. So I dont even know if this is possible but I just had an idea after seeing how small these notches are becoming.

Michael Christensen	Since the new fingerprint sensor is optical - does the screen have to be on for it to scan your finger?  I am wondering this, since the capacitive sensors I've used so far, all work without turning on the screen - which means that unlocking is a singular action.   It seems to me, that for the 6T the screen would have to be turned on first (making unlocking 2 actions) or use always on.  Anyone who can shed some light on this?

AmpEdition	Still has a stupid ass notch and resolution, why companies try to look like Apple is beyond me, why would you want that stupid notch everyone complaining about! Only reason I‚Äôm going Samsung is because they stay away from the notch! Listen up OnePlus...stop with the the notch and the stupid resolutions...it should be a 1440p screen and is how to make you‚Äôre phone look faster in benchmarks! Samsung does slightly worse but they are pushing a higher resolution!

Raghu Ram	can anyone help me to decide weather i should go for op6t 128gb or 256gb ?????
totallydubbedHD	I wish I could have gotten this phone for review to flame it. Waste of money, get the S9 instead. Guess what: better camera, a 3.5mm jack and in the UK near identical priced.
Sourav Ghosh	I typed in google - oneplus 6 , it is showing ur video link of 6t üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Timothy McSwain LP	I‚Äôm all for a smaller notch (or better yet, they could stick to the whole ‚ÄúNever Settle‚Äù thing and not have a notch at all) but that thing just looks weird to me. I‚Äôm not sure why, honestly... but it does bother me.
Isaias Arriola	But you have an Apple Watch? And your daily driver is one plus ? Yeah nice try
Will Kim	I got to say this notch is the best looking notch compared to other smart phone with notches.

Trevor Demelo	I was very much set on a Pixel 3 before I heard about this guy. What you get for your money here, is so much more than what you get from Google's offering. I love the Pixel line and im gonna miss some the software side of things but I will probably love this phone just as much.
pranav js	Youtube showed me the ad of pocco f1 saying same processor at a lesser priceüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú
Mei Seav	No headphone jack and don't wanna buy? Yeah get the 6. Personally, I think Oneplus giving us the USB-C port for the headphone jack is considerate - just keep it attached to your regular set of earphones and it's alright. You've got to be incredibly pedantic to complain about that.
Vishnu SZ BLz	The thing is that I think I can't play PUBG without a support of charging and so without a headphone üò™
Syed Azrai	essential phone > one plus 6t
Han Bulban	Has built in communist Chinese spying chip, no thanks

Michael Mendoza	I normally dislike notches, but this has to be the best looking one so far.
Zuraiz Zafar	I definitely like the design much more than the OnePlus 6. Now I feel bad for buying a OnePlus 6.
Naveen N	Still One plus 6 stands better than 6t !, No headphone jack? One plus going to release wireless headphone! That's the reason?
Saria Quamer	Is Smart Boost Coming To OnePlus 6 ???
Ku m√∏√∏√∏	Good to see you have good music tasteüòÅ
Your Senpai	I just called TMobile and did a 'day before' pre order. I'm super excited to finally have this badboy. I've been an avid LG user from the G1 through to the G6 as my daily drivers and recommends, but now I'm ascending to another company that has really caught my attention and their hardware scales in the comparisons.  Here's to a new gen of phones and I'm finally ready to let go of the LG logo for a while.
Rohit Sole	Eminem Lucky you spotted üòõüíØ
Anand Kumar	Liked the aspect ratio of this video.
Stephen McAllister	i believe one day apple will do away with the front facing camera just like they did with the 3.5mm jack. they will be the first company to have a full display.

Nandu Krishna	Headphone jack üòû
Bitcoin Rich	Still too much money
GLTSA	No 3.5mm headphone jack! I am keeping my 5T then.
Clint Elie	It's so strange that most of the Android phone companies/fans mocked Apple when they removed the headphone jack.. mmmm
Strutting_strat	OnePlus 6T-- 256GB storage-- $629 MacBook Air 2018-- 128 GB storage-- $1199  I know these are apples to oranges, but isn't there something wrong with this picture? I feel like this is the upteenth time they STILL  haven't updated the MacBook Air baseline storage, yet they keep raising the price!
Swadhin Thakkar	Who else noticed the four "6" cards?

Santosh Aryal	Slower than the touch what?
Ditrix Genesis	the thing with the in display reader is that I can't instantly unlock it. even if it were as fast as traditional fingerprint readers, it requires me to turn on the screen. Or does it work with screen off as well?
PEACE OUT	Jerry rig everything put out a oneplus 6t durability even before it was officially launched
Vama Shah	Nice video! Is the 256GB variant heavier than the 128GB one? wanted to know that before ordering!
ThePrada21	Love your Videos for great content and Thanks Friend
ishvaku Sunger	Marques is trending in indiaüî•
Screaming Cat	Weird flex but ok
Trekker G	Great video, I just purchased the Nokia 7.1 as my second back up driver. But I‚Äôm liking the 6T, I went with the Nokia because it had the headphone jack and it had stock android. And for the price it was perfect as a second phone.
Alexandro Del Rosario	Mi Mix 3 gonna eat this phone alive

MaskSo James	No headphone jack = Pass, I‚Äôll stick with my iPhone 6s till the end

FG. xLr8	similar to VIVO V11
Varsha Jain	How do you use the fingerprint reader when you add a tempered glass?
Ajit Chaudhary	I wish Samsung launches an android one phone with all flagship features, just for once at least. I'm not a big fan of their touchwiz UI.
Nicholas Jeremy	REASON WHY I WANT A HEADPHONE JACK ON MY PHONE; I CHARGE AND LISTEN TO MUSIC MORE TIMES THEN I DON'T THE NOTCH IS NICE THOUGH
Tanner Schwien	This or pixel 3???
newbro	The lack of notification led broke the deal for me.
Kazi Itquan Ahmed	This is the best android smartphone ever
XGiveMeLibertyX	Fucking annoying. I still use the headphone jack!  I have the original Pixel XL and I think I will be pulling a Kanye and keep it for as long as it will work
Brandon Tyler	Nice Neistat shirt!
jaya vardhan	I am using one plus 5 upgrade to one plus 6t  (üëç or üëé)
N. Kamalfar	Oneplus is doing great. I have a Oneplus 6 and I am really happy with it. I wish this one had the headphone jack too.
LivinlikeLarry	imo beats new pixels in almost every way but the camera. Display is much better plus the smaller notch. No front facing stereo speakers but that's far from a deal breaker. 6GB and up for RAM. Oxygen OS is nothing compared to Samsung's skins, still clean and smooth. In glass fingerprint reader. Only cons are no wireless charging, no headphone jack as with most phones now, and camera could use improvement with night shots. Otherwise, stunning looking phone for the price
Satyanarayanmurti Katta	Nice. I liked it.
fherry13	I always considered oneplus phones but they were never compatible with Verizon. The OP6T is the first phone that will be compatible, so now I can finally consider it
shrediknight	Headphone jack removed !! What if  i want to listen to songs on charging on wired headphone
AbigailO_o Mishu*-*	NO HEAD PHONE JACK??! WHAT!! Pass
Ghost WOW	It is time for uncle headphones Jack to help it Jack off
Al A	All the little fuckdroid pussies automatically hit like on non-Apple videos.
SirDoodles	I'm actually liking that "tear drop" notch. It's different and as you use the phone more and more you won't even notice it after a while. If it bugs you still, you can turn it off (: Great phone and one I will be investing in üòä  Besides the Nokia 7.1 also
Saisagar Tata	Am i the only one who think this guy is biased when it comes to one plus?
Tahmid Sahriar	Wallpaper
Priyanshu Kumar	Nigro you was very bad English speaking
Manmit Shelar	Please help out..Which is the best camera phone 1. Google Pixel 3 2. Huawei Mate 20 3. OnePlus 6T
Maxi Sep√∫lveda	I was hoping to buy the oneplus 6 and they do this, idk know what to do, i would think the slow print reader might be the dealbreaker.. any advises?
Zaufa Mohd Uzir	the battery and under screen fingerprint sensor does not justify the removal of headphone jack. make the phone thicker, idc. but keep the goddamn headphone jack. OnePlus is officially riding on apple dick now.
Patrick Navarro	Ima ask mah uncle for it I need no note 9 I can have some note 9 specs for $600
Nishid Rai	Do a one plus 6 vs 6t wether it's worth the upgrade or not?
ReplayTheBeatz	I would rather a regular fingerprint scanner and a headphone jack than an in glass fingerprint scanner and no headphone jack
Ming HUANG	DAYUM THAT PHONE IS THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN
Hassan Haq	2:17 Same, it's not parallel to the bezels as the Oneplus 6 is, I personally prefer the old notch with the LED
Minh Nguyen Huynh	So...Oneplus is owned by Oppo from China. Do you think they put some sort of spy chip in the phone? Asking for a friend...
Swapnil Parikh	Always on point review, thanks Marques. One thing I wanted to ask you is that you mentioned that performance of OnePlus is outstanding, I remember you had done one review of Pixel 2 ‚ÄúMarginally‚Äù slowing down after year of use, how does OnePlus(6 and 6T yet to become a year old) stands on that front? Only thing I prefer (my current)iPhone(6s) over Android is its top notch performance even after 3 years of use, if OnePlus is at the Par with that then I think I have found my next phone brand !! Will look forward for your opinion..Thanks
Pradeep Jayabal	Is it water proof ?
John Nash	But VIVO NEX S got all that 6 months before 1+ .... so I don‚Äôt get it what‚Äôs the big deal ?!
∆ó Œî∆ó≈á'≈¶ ŒûLIGI–ëLŒû	Wow. iPhone XR makes white color on phones look better. White on these Super AMOLED displays look yellow
Mike T	$549 is a steal. Still on my Pixel XL though. I know I'd get used to it, but I'm not buying a phone with a notch. You know we're a year or two til they're gonna. I'm content til then.
KING A.B	Nice phone bro.
Sidard Tayenjam	It looks like Vision from Avengers
David Dixon	I don't get it. Soooo Samsung is the only company smart enough to figure out how to make an epic phone, awesome battery AND STILL include a headphone jack??!!  Either Samsung is just smarter than every company or these companies are just full of shit. Awesome looking phone but I don't respect these new companies just taking apples design and copying it. Be original
niranjan baburaj	The absence of the head phone jack is a deal breaker
Leon Kozyarsky	But when are they gonna support Verizon tho
Vicarious 95	Samsung, LG and Nokia have kept the headphone jack!
jalabi99	I fully anticipate being booted off of the OnePlus subreddit once I post my one line review of this phone:  NO HEADPHONE JACK + NOTCH = NEVER BUYING IT

Humberto Gonzalez	Hmmm, will it work on Sprint?
Michael Dietzen	yes it is
Msza Fit	In display fingerprint scanner is unnecessary, it can be put at the back, instead we want 3.5 mm headphones jack
Nevil Jacob Paul	Wallpaper link please?
Daniella Rose	Ugly thick chin and vampire notch
Mike Mayhem	Definitely considering T-Mobile s trade in deal to make this phone a steal.
Kishore Anand	My Oneplus 5 is best. Keeping aside bezzeless craze, it rocks in all features. I am not going to upgrade my phone untill the notch era is gone and in-screen fingerprint is improved.
Tanmay Kamath	I'd rather spend money on buying a Phone with a headphone jack rather than spending on gimmick (in screen fingerprint)
NBAMBGOD	Wanna free IPhone XS? Good then watch my latest video on how you can enter very easy steps on how to win! Good luck‚ù§Ô∏è
music stan	I hate the notch so much :(
JRM Productions	I'm to poor for a cool phone like that. But at least I can watch nice videos like this.
Nick Petrilli	I absolutely love One+.  My 5 finally bit the dust the other day and I'm heartbroken.  Perfect timing to get a 6T though.
Kiranpal Singh	omiting the 3.5mm jack means the type c port will be utilized nearly twice as much and there will be a possibility of damage due to over use of jack.
Its ur boi e	Should i trade my x max for the one plus
tirken eowin	a few problems with your video... you state that the starting price of the oneplus 6t is the same as the starting price of the oneplus 6, it's not... the 6 started at US $529, the 6t starts at $549, albiet with more storage... but you state that they added the storage and kept the same price, which is false..  also... you state that they kept the same camera from "last year's phone."  The oneplus 6 was released 5 months ago, and re-introduced OIS, missing since the 3t.

Abitosh	I wanted to wait for the S10 lineup but realized the plus would probably be up in the 8-900s which is way too much for me so I might consider this. But I have to really think about this cz of the no headphone jack

martin bragstad	is it only going to be black 6t's?
Jake R	Apple has really let itself go.
Philip Carroll	MKBHD, do you know if that adapter will be supplied within the purchase price or is it a sneaky upsell!? There is a headphone adapter either way, it's not like you can never plug in you just have to plug in via your charge port. Bit annoying if at home late at night and looking to charge and get some sexy MKBHD content into your eyes and ears but if you're out and about commuting or whatever then you're good to go! Not as big a deal as people make out.
Mari M	I'll wait for the next upgrade I'll wait for a better fingerprint scanner

Alexander Cisneros	Rip may have to get cause I broke my 7 Plus and have to use my mom's old 5C rip the life of a college student lmao
Aluzcz	I think this is close to how iPhone would look like when Jobs would be alive, current iPhones have zero innovation. This is proper innovation, last but not least this devices will work even after years there is not inbuilt or sw pushed obsoletes. I had the original oneplus one, had it for 4 years and it worked perfectly after that i switched to 5t which still works and it works great.  Now I'm tempted to buy this, but just because I'm getting some cash from my employer ever some time to buy a new device, without it i would not even consider as the current device is great.  The only letdown is no headphone jack, I hope there is USB-C - jack conversion in the box as otherwise for me as well as for many others this is useless and i dont talk just about listening music but mainly about work, i need to make many calls from my phone during the day and the most reliable and comfortable is standard wired headset, it works every time you need it and the quality is good.

Hernan Sainz	I love it but I'm still sticking to my one plus 5 Slate grey that thing is still mad fast.

Ascencion	Is this still not good on Verizon?
Akeem Walker	Where did you buy that phone
Filip Gierszewski	What a load of bollox. No headphone jack ... we wanted to put bigger battery. Yeah right ... it has nothing to do with Oneplus using OPPO main boards .... and because OPPO ditched the jack ... Oneplus had no other option.

Mikey Ogbechie	i‚Äôm definitely a fannnn MB
greycounciller	My only gripe with this phone is that they didn't take the option of improving the camera module and leaving the fingerprint sensor on the back.  I liked his comments about unlocking the phone in the dark. You'll always light up the screen somehow, either by fingerprint sensor, Infrared or power key and pin.
Lufe Torres	great review. Would you send me the brand/model of the grey couch in front of the tv please? thanks

chimeto	What would you say about the battery of the OnePlus 6 with android Pie? Did you have any issue?
Adrian Mejorada	Wait for S10 or buy 6t???
michael67876	i was gonna buy that new phone but when i heard no head phone jack im like nope no ,no no im out i cant i need a headphone jack i have these very special headphone that i just cant part with
Shakeeb	As much as I admire the value you get for your money with one plus, I am not impressed with their service on the return/exchange side of things. I bought the one plus and in the first week the glass screen protector that I bought with the phone broke in my pocket without any pressure on it. The face recognition also isn't great as it unlocks with other guys who have similar facial hair as me. When I told OnePlus about this issue, they wanted me to send my phone and inspect it. I would basically be left without a phone for 2 weeks and I noticed 4 months down the line that the glass on the camera has cracked. Overall I would love oneplus to be more understanding of the issues customers face and give atleast a replacement for the faulty phones.
Lukekboy	october 2018???
Nitin Arun	I currently have still been sticking to my Nexus 6p because I couldn't find a phone that really interested me and had all the needs I wanted . When the OnePlus 6 came out it did satisfy my needs but I couldn't afford it at the time , but now with the One plus 6T having that same price with all of the new features .....most definitely gonna be my next phone
macarari	I'm sad they got rid of the headphone jack, and the sensor on the back. Bigger battery is a major go, and waterproof
Tomas Shalkauskas	That's why i Chosƒó 6 but not 6t because of mini jack and much more storage 256 GB and 8GB Ram.  why do you need finger print than it opens by face?  i dobt need that finger print  and lose mini jack that why i chose 6 and for more resonable price.
Mrperson 1738	What is wrong with having a fingerprint scanner on the back, honestly I mean I get that companies wanna show off there tech but they could make a separate phone or have the same phone with a fingerprint scanner on the back
Allistar _	Time for nethunter
Sage X	They can make a perfect hardware phone, but it doesn't have my vote. Literally what made me leave android was the TERRIBLE support from 3rd party apps. You know its pretty bad when even google apps work better on iOS than Android thats honestly just insulting.

niclaren	its fucking beautiful, never was, never will be, a better notch
Josip Bratovƒçak	skip to 2:44 and see Marq shaking from tech geek candy ^^
Andrew Gray	Won't get it because they got rid of the headphone jack. Seriously, the headphone jack is tiny, and LG and Samsung have no problem fitting it into a phone with great specs. Seems to me OnePlus really thought they could make more money from wireless headphones. I'll stick with LG from now on thanks.
Alex Hernandez	I want to keep the jack. I love it. And it seems a lot more reliable then Bluetooth forsure.  But I also see a lot of people going wireless so the jack death is sure to come sooner then we like. And I‚Äôm a iPhone8 user been a Apple costumer for four years and I have to say they lack innovation. Also, the XR IS A JOKE! The price is a shame and the thing doesn‚Äôt display 1080 p just horrible.
CoolRaul	When Verizon gets it or Verizon compatibility

Is it gonna be V40, 6T, Mi Mix 3, XZ3, or Mi 8 Explorer/Pro? Also, She doesn't lyk a phone from manufacturer lyk Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung.

DeadHead	I was never planning on buying one being happy with my 6 but I was honestly expecting to see oneplus work their magic and get the fingerprint sensor blistering fast and I'm a little disappointed with the result. No doubt it will improve over time and one of the reason why i like the brand so much,
Pedro Torres	So, OnePlus keeps making tablets. They should make a phone next time.
Chris Spadafora	Price aside I'm buying the 6t or the Pixel 3xl, and I'm extremely torn what do you guys think?!

dac19xx	What's wrong with removing the headphone jack ?! I listen people cry with years for that.. me personally doesn't bother me not even a little.. by the way as OnePlus said.. they removed it so you can get larger battery and screen fingerprint so stop being such cry babies.. if you hate extra connector for your headphones go buy some 2012 smartphone and you can have that option lmao..
kuurocks	Does anyone remember if the orignial OnePlus 6 has a head phone jack? OnePlus 6 is probably smething I would pick up b/c now i will be cheaper and I could probably get it on tmobile since it's pretty much the same phoneXD

Avieshek Rajkhowa	That really isn't a bigger battery considering a Note 9 with Dual-sim and SD-Card Slot + A stylus with an integrated supercapacitor + Headphone Jack still manages a 4000mAh battery. This phone has none.  Recently, through AndroidPolice there was 5.5" phone released in China that had 5500mAh battery. Considering this, this phone should have 6500mAh then. That would be a bigger battery for the screen.

Parth Doshi	Why is headphone jack such a deal breaker for people? They should be more concerned about the slightly slower unlocking speed, you unlock your phone hundreds of times a day and it needs to be less than 0.3 seconds
Dr B	Not the same Price.  The OP6 starts at $529, and jumps to $579.  There was no $549 OP6.  But I love my OP6, and love the new OP6t just the same.  OnePlus is hard to beat when it comes to performance.  Their only real competition there is Apple.

Mukund Kumar	‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Awesome..Superb Video !! While we all enjoy this video let us also not forget that ... 'Those who do not learn from History are doomed to repeat it.'  The Mughal rule lasted for approx 181 years and ruined India. History tells us that Mughal emperor Akbar had committed many criminal atrocities..... * Akbar was Immoral in Character and Nature. Akbar possessed a inordinate lust for women, just like his ancestors and predecessors. One of Akbar‚Äôs motives during his wars of aggression against Rajputs was to capture their women, daughters and sisters. The Rajput women of Chittor prefered ‚ÄúJauhar‚Äù (immolation) than to be captured and disrespectfully treated as servants and prostitutes in Akbar‚Äôs harem. Abul Fazal in Ain-e-Akbari provides accounts of some such acts which are too disgusting to even mention. He had burnt down thousands of villages killing innocent people. Not just that, Akbar had ordered to cut down thousands of trees . The locals in order to save the trees use to tie themselves around trees, which included children and women further infuriated Akbar and he ordered immediately to cut down the trees along with the people. Brutal. Maharana Pratap is considered to exemplify the qualities to which Rajputs aspire. Maharana Pratap never accepted Akbar as ruler of India, and fought Akbar all his life. Akbar first tried diplomacy to win over Maharana Pratap but nothing worked. In the siege of Chittor Akbar had killed 27,000 civilians in cold blood. This left a lasting impression on Maharana's mind and he decided he could not bow to such injustice and cruelty.  The title of 'GREAT' should be rightly attributed to MAHARANA PRATAP and not Akbar. * SIMILARLY....IAM SURE, We all agree that Aurangzeb  was a religious fanatic and a tyrant. If you read the Mogul history we can very clearly understand this : - (1) Aurangzeb re-introduced jizya (tax) on non-Muslims, led numerous campaigns of attacks against non-Muslims, forcibly converted Hindus to Islam and destroyed Hindu temples. (2) For converting other non-muslims he never hesitated to use any tactics, including torturing in inhuman and cruel ways and never ever regretted for it.(eg) The way he tortured Sambaji,the son of Chatrapathi Shivaji is a solid proof of his inhuman attitude and intolerant nature. (3) Aurangzeb issued orders in 1669, to all his governors of provinces to "destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and that they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practice of idolatrous forms of worship". These orders and his own initiative in implementing them led to the destruction of numerous temples, Some temples were destroyed entirely; in other cases mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Idols in temples were smashed, and the city of Mathura was temporarily renamed as Islamabad in local official documents.  (4) Last words of Aurangzeb on his death-bed to his sons: ‚ÄòI know not who I am, where I shall go , or what will happen to this sinner, full of sins.  . . My years have gone by profitless. God has been in my heart, yet my darkened eyes have not recognized His true light. . . There is no hope for me in the after-life. The fever is gone, but only the skin is left. .. I have greatly sinned and know not what torment awaits me. . . ‚Äô * ALSO....DID YOU KNOW - Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus & Christians and carried out forced conversions.According to C. K. Kareem, Tippu Sultan issued an edict for the destruction of Hindu temples in Kerala. Tipu got Runmust Khan, the Nawab of Kurool, to launch a surprise attack upon the Kodava Hindus (also called Coorgs or Coorgis) who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas were converted to the  Islam, and incorporated them into Ahmedy corps. In 1788, Tipu reportedly ordered his governor in Calicut Sher Khan to begin the process of converting Hindus to Islam and in July of that year, 200 Brahmins were forcibly converted and made to eat beef..The archaeological survey of India has listed three temples which were destroyed during the reign of Tipu Sultan. These were the Harihareshwar Temple at Harihar which was converted into a mosque, the Varahswami Temple in Srirangapatnam and the Odakaraya Temple in Hospet. The following is a translation of an inscription on the stone found at Seringapatam, which was situated in a conspicuous place in the fort: 'Oh Almighty God! dispose the whole body of infidels! Scatter their tribe, cause their feet to stagger! Overthrow their councils, change their state, destroy their very root! Cause death to be near them, cut off from them the means of sustenance! Shorten their days! Be their bodies the constant object of their cares (i.e., infest them with diseases), deprive their eyes of sight, make black their faces (i.e., bring shame).' -NOW YOU KNOW  Like if you BELIEVE India as a secular country desperately needs UNIFORM CIVIL CODE.  Jai HIND - Vande Ma-Taram !!! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Ansh Gupta	2:1 ratio Video..Nice MKBHD
J S	have they been able to fix the issue, when you are on a call and you get another call in call waiting, the display wakes up in the call waiting and your side face can touch any button on the screen and you end up messing your both calls.

Waifu Rem	*Headphone jack disconnected from the server*
JR Zeebs	Honestly it seems like a 6 that has less a focus on practicality and more towards the unnecessary, such as in-screen finger print scanner, which is much slower than the on-screen scanner on the 6, plus it requires the screen to get bright. Also, assuming you hide the notch, the top bezel will be practically the exact same between both phones. Also the 6 has a notification light, but I'm assuming the 6T doesn't anymore? I mean considering it's the same price, though I can't complain. Bigger battery is always a plus. but rip the headphone jack, hopefully they'll be able to bring it back in the future, once the technology takes up less space.

Ooi Zhing Yao	I LOVE PRICES, YOU KNOW, EVERYDAY, I LOOK AT SOMETHING I LIKE AND THEN I GIVE IT TO MY DAD TO SEE WHAT IT IS! AND THAT MY DAD SAID: look at the price. I WAS SO HAPPY THAT KICKED MY FOOTBALL AROUND THE HOUSE AND BREAK EVERYTHING, IT WAS A GREAT DAY. PRICES ARE ALWAYS THE BEST, F*CK PRICES.
Neko Ears	Is it worth the upgrade from my one plus 6? Probably not, Im waiting on better speakers and brighter screen
vinod 259102	Oneplus 6t got always on display?
NwJonathans	This is like the Razer Phone 2 with 60hz OLED display. Twice cheaper. Both no 3.5mm jack, same chipset, and so on. C'mon, if you want to upgrade your phone, this might be a better option instead of the Pocophone which has quite many flaws.
Tech Science Malayalam	*Hi Iam From Kerala* *PLEASE PROMOTE MY CHANNEL*
Jiahu wu	How much
Andy Singh	Whilst it's personal preference, my biggest drawback is the location of the fingerprint scanner.  For me, having the fingerprint scanner on the back seemed like it's 'natural' position as it's where you'd place your fingers when using the device.  Other than that, it looks like a solid phone
Klumsy Kameleon	For me, it's Samsung for the best of the best - and then OnePlus for the best value. Apple, Google are jokes. HTC haven't heard from them in a while, LG produce solid phones but not outstanding IMO. Lenovo and Motorola could do with stepping up their game instead of making the same phones over and over again.
Khalid Khan	I still love my one plus 3.

Umesh Sah	Which phone u recommend pixel 2xl or one plus 6t. Pls let me know. Thankq
Benjamin Lambert	I think when USB type C connected headphones become a more common occurence in the higher end people will stop caring about headphone jacks being lost. I say by next year audio companies will have advanced enough to put an end to the 3.5mm on most device types for good.
bruce wang	the Huawei MATE 20 basic model still have a hole that you can enjoy your high quality earphone.

Justin Ammerman	So how does the camera on the 6T stack up against the Pixel 3? Because if the Pixel 3 isn't $350 worth of better (to get the 128gb, non XL) I kind of don't see the point in buying one over this.

mlzanercik	(((Spiritual Soul Battle)))  ***There is an ongoing Spiritual battle for all of our SOULS! And all of us are being used as guinea pigs for SATAN and you don‚Äôt even know it!  *** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and (((SORCERERS))), and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8).  (Sorcery=Pharmakeia in the Greek   Language=Pharmacy=DRUG USERS!=Not sober minded. This is a freewill open door portal, to allow them to come into your body/temple of every foul and unclean Spirit/Demon. Your freewill choice‚Äôs gives them the access so they can take it over).  *** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul. (Proverbs 8:36). (So when you are sinning against God you are sinning against your own Soul.  *** abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. (1 Peter 2:11). (Lust is a name of a Demonic Spirit. Just like the Spirit of Anger, Homosexuality and Pride etc.  ***Now with this CERN/The Devils Portal being opened up in the name of, ‚ÄúScience‚Äù, this world is becoming HELL which, the Baphomet/Satan wants as his saying goes, ‚ÄúAs above, so Below.‚Äù This is why you need to put the Blood of Jesus all over yourselves and your family members. And by showing Jesus you love him by obeying his commandments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  ***(Jesus): You will know the truth and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32). (Set you free from what??? Demonic Spirits!!! Submit to God and Resist the devil and he will flee from you!!! (James 4:7).  *** And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. (Luke 10:17).  ***Keep in mind, God will not allow Demonic Spirits to destroy mankind. Demonic Spirits, through mans freewill, is the only way they can cause harm to us and make us hurt or destroy our selves. Jesus, my king and hopefully your king as well, has them on a short leash or they would destroy the earth if they got the chance.  ***Remember, Demonic Spirits are inter-dimensional beings with alien bodies. Case in point, ‚ÄúThe Greys‚Äù, are the working bees of SATAN!!!  *** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Shafee Saadman	It's 2018, most people are already adapted to having no headphone jacks. Not a big deal, to be honest.
vikas H.S	Taking out the headphone's jack is a bad decision till wireless headphones are developed in par with them.
Mr. Grumps	DO NOT BUY 2018 ANDROID PHONES!!  2019 ANDROID PROCESSORS ARE GETTING A HUGE UPGRADE IN SPEED AND GRAPHICS!!  2019 ANDROID PROCESSORS ARE GOING TO BE 70%+ FASTER IN PROCESSING AND 70%+ IN GPU POWER!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
Aziz N	Phones are getting more powerful which means customers will have to buy fewer new phones... The time gap between new phones should be longer but filled with new original features and new technology that's actually damn worth paying for. Otherwise, you pay 600$ for a phone but a few months later boom there is a new phone that's 95% identical but that minor difference makes people feel as though they have an outdated device. Somehow sheep keep buying them :)
Riley	wow this is the first oneplus that i've been disappointed by. get rid of the headphone jack to make room for a mediocre under screen fingerprint reader? what the hell are they thinking?

Just be open to change, it's fun to see what the world of tech does tomorrow instead of repeating yesterday. Lol
Cultti	Personally I don't understane cry about headphone jack. There has been Bluetooth headphones available quite long time now.. I haven't used phone's jack over 4 years now so I'm bit supprised that people are still complying about it. People are not complaining USB-C anymore?
Ivan Campa	Great phone, 10/10 would buy again (I have 12 of them)

ibia gaming	our on trending
Carlos	If it's not the big ass notch, it's the lightning beam saber green shooting from the screen in order to read your fingerprint that bothers us.  If it's not the 4000mah battery missing, it's the non wireless charging that they had to sacrifice to keep the device at a budget.  If it's not the headphone jack missing, it's the lack of water resistant IP rating that seems to bother us.  You people have your heads so far up your asses you can't even remember that the 1st generation iPhone 8gb model was released at a sale price of $599 USD just like various other devices that had similar specs and prices. You people will never be pleased...  Pretty damn good device, and pretty damn good review not to mention the amazing editing.
Samuel Holden	I used to be a petitioner for the 3.5mm jack. Now, since I've got a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't care less. My cars support Bluetooth and so does any decent, modern home audio system; that or play over Wi-Fi. I'm definitely considering this phone. I'm disappointed at the lack of wireless charging üòî but I don't think that'll dissuade me. Clearly still the market leader at this price point.

Shiladitya Biswas	In-Display fingerprint looks good, feels trendy, show-off able...but, it NOT practical and functional. In a normal fingerprint sensor. Where it is placed at the back of the phones are the most ergonomic and practical ones, IMHO. It is where our fingers place naturally. For In-Display sensors, we have to use two hands to unlock a phone - turning the screen on with one hand and place fingers of the other hand. It is also even slower than the regular ones. Too clumsy IMO. On the other hand I also like how Samsung has shifted sensors from the back of the screen to the lock button at the side of the phone in some of its latest phones.

Irvine Gray	I must say looking at this phone... I actually don't the teardrop shaped notch. Up until I seen this implementation of the notch I really was a big notch hater. I prefer this notch even to the essential phone as the gentle curves seem a lot less intrusive. If I had this phone I think I might even leave the notch enabled.  As for the unlocks... Was that face unlock slower than the 6 and 5t? Looked it... And I don't think they should have moved the fingerprint scanner inside the screen. It's nowhere near fast enough yet to compete with the speed of the old readers. I feel like they moved it just because they could and the everyday user might end up paying the price for it. Looks slow and gimmicky. I guess people might want to show it off because it's new though.   Irvine Gray- OnePlus 5t owner.

Deric Brown	It is hard to embrace change especially when we have had the head phone jack in our phones for as long as we can remember but like any new generation of mobile phone technology we had to adjust to having no qwerty keyboard and hardware buttons on the front of the display.  With that being said OnePlus is following a trend  that is now being set for all smartphones being released. Its best not to fight on something that's already in effect but to embrace the change and get ready for the next evolution of phone technology.
Mikael Fredriksson	Have the OnePlus 6 so I think I'll be waiting for the oneplus 7 or 7t! Don't see a reason to upgrade just yet! This phone is a beast! Especially with emulators.

Dank Gank	At this point, I really don't care about the headphone jack. When Apple dropped it, bluetooth was still a mess, so that was annoying, but now, even with my S7 Edge (which has a headphone jack) I find myself using bluetooth headphones more than I do my wired headphones because they have have finally become more convenient. Even cheap $20 bluetooth earbuds have become very good & very easy to use, most having auto-pairing and stable connectivity, so I would definitely take a bigger battery over a headphone jack.

Psy4tech	So Face recognition is still fast with few security and unusable on night. And the fingerprint is slower, kill your eyes on night. It's what we call a great update. I don't understand why people still love OnePlus and buy it like sheeps. It has only the price for what you have. It's not a high-end smartphone, so that's normal that it is cheaper.

Mate Mate	They really don't understand how much of a dealbreaker no headphone jack is for a lot of people and how much profitable it would be for them to put that f*cking 3.5 mm hole back. Seriously quit your new-evolutionary-no-headphone-jack shit, it doesn't bring your company any good.

Kevin Eric Siangco	No headphone jack = no buy. Was seriously gonna buy this phone until i learned they removed the jack. To anyone who says use bluetooth instead, have you tried playing games (like pubg) with a bluetooth headset? There's always a sound delay over bluetooth even on my Jaybird X3's and using a dongle makes the phone awkward to hold on landscape.

Boris	Considering the speakers on OP6 is pretty mediocre at best, I would still take the headphone jack over the in-screen finger print reader and slightly larger battery. That versatility is so handy for media consumption & gaming.   Maybe in the future when there are really solid, true-wireless options for android (akin to the convenience of Airpods), then the headphone jack may finally be redundant, but for now, I still feel it offers value to a phone.

Works so well that I accidentally unlock my phone sometimes when I put it in my pocket and my finger brushes over the sensor. They didn't need to change that, it was awesome.

Arius Atkins	One thing that is starting to piss me off, which is very minor, but I have been used to for a long time: That In-Screen fingerprint scanner should be able to work when the display is off. Same thing it has been on more recent Nexus devices and the Pixel devices with the rear fingerprint sensor. Just my opinion, but it's something that bothers me.
The Boot Nerd	Loss of head phone jack made me upset. Have been using OnePlus 6 since it's launch. And I use headphones or earphones a lot. I usually don't need a bigger battery than the one OP6 has, cause I stay in the office and always surrounded by ports and also carry 2 powerbanks for no reason. Wireless charging would have been an improvement for many people I believe instead of onscreen fingerprint.
lopwidth	No jack, eat a d.. oneplus
Sunil Dhaka	The 6T is a copy of the Vivo V11 Pro launched some time back. Difficult to tell one from the other especially with the in screen fingerprint scanner. The difference is CPU and display. Before making comparisons please do keep in mind that the Vivo phone costs only about 350 dollars!

Right?  how do you recommend a phone that costs AS much as  a SAMSUNG S9 ? no body needs 128Gb , 6gb of ram. even my pc has 4gb hhh. They should always sell at a target price of 300$ or 350$ the best specs phone they could ever build.

Vimal Kumar Velu Pillay	At this point, I pretty much don't mind if they stick to the headphone jack or not. My audio choice has always been using bluetooth speakers and wireless headphones ( if I ever need to use a headphone/earphones ). If they say bigger battery, bigger storage, better performance and better camera with reasonable price, I'm interested.

Silas Gates	I dont care what anybody says I dont think wireless headphones are worth having until they have: better battery life, more reliable connectivity, a smaller less clunky form factor and more affordable pricing. Also this is me more being picky, but bluetooth sound quality isn't on par with auxiallary and though it's subtle, it's noticable.

I've had my 6P for almost 2 years now, and honestly the storage is a big problem for me (32gB), and the software is just getting super slow. Even though I'm a big Android person, I'm considering switching to an iPhone so I can connect my friends better (through FaceTime and other apple specific features). I'm also super picky with the headphone jack, so my 2 candidates so far are the OnePlus 6 and iPhone 7. Which phone should I get?

chris ferebee	Been using wireless headphones for a few yrs now so not having a headphone jack doesn't bother me!  Not having ip water resistant isn't a reason to not get this and wireless charging can't fast charge but the phone charging to 70% in 30mins is phenomenal!  Its also Half the price of an iPhone XS Max! This will have a Pixel 3 camera port then it'll be taking pics just as good or better than the Pixel 3 yet this phone can record 4k60fps. THIS IS THE PIXEL 3 KILLER!  This phone is a true beast of a smartphone!  Pixel 3 hold this L!

After moving to a Pixel 2 after years of iPhones, the biggest good surprise was how useful the fingerprint reader is on the back.  It's easy to locate as I pull it out of my pocket, and I love the notification shade shortcut by swiping down.  Any reader on the front, no matter how good, just has less functionality than a reader on the back.

King Velexarian	Everyone needs to follow suit with the removal of the headphone jack. Still include a dongle for now but eventually stop putting it in the box. Wireless innovation has so much farther to go and if we keep riding the ancient tech it‚Äôll be a slow process.
Bradford D'souza	I get it, removing the headphone jack is a big deal. But is it really? Initially, I too was dead against it when Apple first removed it. But now that all other manufacturers are heading in the same direction, it got me thinking...how much of an inconvenience is it really? Headphone users are of two types,  1. Bluetooth headphone users who won't have any issue with the removal of the headphone jack and  2. Wired headphone users who just have to keep the provided dongle attached to their exisiting headphones of choice in whatever bag / pouch / pocket they're already carrying their wired headphones in. Which IMO isn't THAT big a deal as people are making it out to be. For eg: Calling it a deal breaker for an otherwise really great phone.

PlayerNotFound	At least apple isn't gay. *OH WAIT*
Joey Pomeroy	Im still on that samsung train, i use the headphone jack
Yousanflics Young	what about the soundÔºü
Jack Hanington	One of the only phones with a notch that I wouldn't mind having. I like this better than the essential phone. Something about the slope makes it way less noticeable in my opinion. Still sticking with my LG V30, though.
Taylonkeezy Themeparkreviewer	Weird enough I can get behind this but I'd rather a headphone jack no matter what
Bartek Cygan	What is the calendar widget?
Satria Topan	And netizen want this phone. Code : giveaway.
Priyank Deshmukh	Problem is their reliability. I gifted my dad, a OnePlus 5 last year, and it's motherboard went off a couple of months in, and its Android updates are not super compatible sometimes with the device itself.
Romario Stewart	The RealMe 2 was the first phone I saw with a notch like that. Also, it was the first I saw with a Fingerprint reader on the screen.
Jerry Vang	Verizon comparability was the only thing keeping me from trying the one plus line... üî•üî•üî•üòµüòµüòµ

JayGuest Vlogs	Nice review, I was thinking about getting that phone at one point, but whoever else sees this I am a rising youtuber and I am looking to become successful on this platform so just help me out by a simple subscription you won‚Äôt regret it laterüòÅ
SASH MITHUN	Type C is not a user friendly.. While we lost or damage in travel then feel very bad.. But USB cable was find with many one and very helpful..
Aniket shrivastava	Why can't phone companies place the headphone jack in the side region
Aaron Rogers	What weather app & widget is that?
Arpan Bera	How you get this cool  wallpapers ?
Sanad Batarseh	6GB vs 8GB of ram....worth paying the difference?
Flynn Bach	Just want to say I LOVE the new aspect ratio. It means i can take full advantage of my note 8 screen without cropping out a ton of the shot. Awesome content as usual; you're the joint best source of tech news alongside linus.
Nipun Sharma	I had the OP 1, OP 2 and both had gyroscope issues in gaming. I held  on till the OP 6 and it too had gyroscope issues in gaming. The vibration motor was really bad. Made it feel I was using a budget phone from 2011. The speaker was the worst thing I ever heard on a phone. One can see where they've cut corners. Add to this the still absent wireless charging, no IP rating, and now the omission of the headphone jack. It's all good for the price. The trick lies in how you narrate it. It's all about perspective. For someone who values all these things, this is a rip off at $549 especially when the Galaxy S9 is available at a very similar price. Even last year's Note8 is very compelling. Again, it's how you look at it.
Siggy Tetteh	Definitely my next phone up from the OP 5T! Thanks for the video!
AmazinA100	Sad that Apple Watch only works with iPhone. ‚åöÔ∏è 0:45
Chadd Minchew	Definitely my next phone.  I have the OnePlus 5T and I have been waiting for this phone and it looks great.  I have been somewhat adverse to the notch epidemic, so I skipped the 6 and I feel the teardrop is enough to get me to jump on board the notch train.  My last 4 phones have been OnePlus and I don't see me turning back.  I love these phone for their great performance!!!
karan maurya	Is it available in India for sale?
Bullviper 98	One plus 7 will  sure come with wireless charging !

OneInchPunchR	2Ôºö1 aspect ratio! Awesome!
tejaswi choudhary	I bought the OnePlus 6 , about a week ago instead of waiting for the t variant as it had the headphone jack, much faster finger print scanner, and it's a little cheaper now that OnePlus 6T is rolling out
Gonzalo Gonz√°lez	I've always thought that the cooler the intro song is the greater the phone reviewed will be.
PHOTOPHILE FOCUS	Hello , I'm from Indiaüíì I'm buying this phone is that ok bcz I'm gonna switch MI to one plus 6t I thought it's new nd amazing is that worth to buy that . Plz rply so I can buy üíì
x9x9x9x9x9	But will it bog down after 3-6 months of daily driver use like all the OnePlus phones do? I think it has to do with OxygenOS and the cheap ram they use. Thats always been my problem with oneplus is how you pretty much have to factory reset every few months if you want it to be snappy.
Samiul I	Please review the new Xiaomi Mi3 phone
Vinicius Silva	The fingerprint reader only works when the screen is on? That's bad :/

Rohit Gupta	I would rather go for Samsung s9 at 600 dollars. Because OnePlus is not a flagship killer anymore. They just add one feature in every iteration. I presume maybe next will have wireless charging.
Zane Zinn	They have to use the light to unlock it. The light lights up your finger and the phone takes the reflection and images your finger (very basic explanation)

Ranjeet Kapse	Yes you are nitpicking üòÇ...we can locate the finger print sensor and close eyes for a moment while touching it...and also get used to it in dark ....only smartphones aren't smart ‚úåÔ∏è
GMAN21	What is it with people bitching about the headphone jack????? Ive been an iPhone user for a long time and currently have the iPhone 7 Plus, could care less about a phone jack. At some point the headphone jack is gonna roll and Bluetooth is gonna reign entirely. This phone is incredible and for half the price of a costly iPhone or Samsung phone, gonna consider this myself.

Dominic Goss	Seems like a good time to buy a oneplus 6. I'm sure you'll be able to find it cheaper than a 6T somewhere, and it will have a faster fingerprint scanner and will have a headphone jack.
Immanuel Sam	I think my over all dislike for android was from samsung and partly google.. But these guys have made a great change.. Well done onePlus
Andy Wang	still pretty expensive considering xiaomi mi 8 having same specs and screen (albeit a bigger notch) but much cheaper
sgomez8194	that phone looks amazing!

Cyryl Dave Gelito	I know im not the only one that wants the headphone jack to stay. You lot demand for higher quality camera, better speakers. Pheonomenal screens, extremely thin bezels, and so on. But youre okay with mediocre sound quality through bluetooth or dongle? You say its convenient because wires are messy? And you bash us users who still refuse to transition. Well speak for yourself, because we want the option to use our phone while charging while using the jack at the same time and not worrying about our wireless headset and phone dying at the same because of that stupid dongle.. until the come up with a technology thats on par or better than the jack i will refuse to switch. As of now nothing can beat the sound quality that the jack offers.

ORACLE OF TRUTH	Marques mentioned 6T fingerprint scanner while reviewing Mate 20 Pro, so in this review he was obliged to say how they stack up against each other.... But that did not happen... We are all biased in some way or the other. But most phone reviews of Marques these days sounds like a sponsored content from oneplus. If it is genuinely not the case... Then you need to turn it down a notch... üòú In another 4-6 month oneplus will launch oneplus 7 with SD 855. So there is absolutely no point in burning our hard earned bucks on this one. Cheers!

VERIZON COMPATIBLE. SOLD AF!!  I mean this is huge! A whole new huge market. The revenue alone + exposure gives me so much to look forward to in the 7. I just feel like OnePlus is the flagship killer 10 phones in the making. A slow burn that drives their flagpole atop The mountain of cellphones at long last. In short: as a long time cell phone enthusiast, this will be my first OnePlus device. I'm all in. Thanks MKBHD.

Gossip Heart	When you realize that IPhone parts and components are made by Android phone companies. üòÇ
Troll Troll	I watch these videos just to kill the time. I am still with my iPhone6 after a long battle with HTC OneX. For me iPhone 6 is still great. Nothing to complain about. So, this is not my next phone.

Davo	This 6T came out too soon.. I just bought the 6, 2 months ago. Though I don't mind no headphone jack, but I prefer the fingerprint sensor to be at the back.  Back fingerprint is like the best feature I ever had on a phone. It's  so convenient.
Yaswanth V Adhikari	Do one on the mi mix 3 i can help you get hold of one if you want üòã
Made Bali	One plus always made me feel amazing
Mio Akiyama	Which is better the 6T or the mi mix 3? Trying to figure out which one to buy.
Henrique Guimar√£es	I prefer OnePlus 6 or Pocophone F1. I don't like losing fone jack and the normal fingerprint sensor.

TaxQ	Yes you right Broh, the best thing about One plus team that they have learn alot from Pixel and iPhone.
ian crawford	oppo r17È´òÈÖçÁâà
Apurv Patani	Hit every ball out of the park. I like that tear drop design. Headphone jack removed for a bigger battery, I'll take that deal anyday. We are getting pretty good quality Bluetooth headphones these days, so I don't think that is a problem. This is coming from a guy who used wired headphones up until last year. Even in terms of software, oneplus always impresses. They have different gesture options to choose from. If you don't like the new android p gesture navigation, you have the option of the iphone-like gestures (Did Marques cover that?). And yeah fast and buttery smooth experience that competes with the pixel. This is the easiest and the most obvious recommendation to anyone.

R.J.	At this moment only LG should keep the headphone jack bc their High Fi Quad DAC is now a major selling point for future flagships
Parth Shah	@mkbhd I just got pixel 3xl. I like the camera it has and the speakers are very good too, but with low brightness, less battery hours, less RAM, so many UI bugs, and of course the notch I am having second thoughts. 6T on paper looks better with battery and RAM.   Could you do a comparison for Pixel 3 XL and 6T? Do you think it's worth moving to 6T from a flagship?

Bharath Ulaganathan	We have Poco at half the price with a headphone jack (and a bigger notch, beat that)...  All those who are saying They are gonna move on without the headphone jack were those who complained about it when other companies removed it and now since They are OnePlus Fan Boys and can't leave it in the dark They are acting as if They are taking it easily...

TheCheesyB	Do you need to turn on the screen to activate the fingerprint sensor? Doesn't that kind of defeat the convenience of unlocking with your finger? I got the impression it would unlock by touching the screen while the screen is off based on their promotional videos
Hi im Ish	5:48 Jerryrigeverything will be the one to confirm that lol. Most likely false

Dave Su	People were bitching about no physical keyboard back then. They will get over with  the headphone jack.
„Ç¥„É≥Ëîµ	If OnePlus really claims to be the design guru they are they'd pay extra production cost to eliminate that chin for good. Btw it's mostly an Oppo phone too so I have no idea how they have the balls to brand themselves as a design first co.

Kevin A	Yo review the red hydrogen one phone. There‚Äôs already a review by the verge and the verge does not recommend it. Bad 4v quality and not much better than a Nintendo 3ds. But when you first spoke about it, supposedly it was ‚ÄúDOPE‚Äù. I agree with the verge. Also pictures compared to the pixel 3 don‚Äôt look any better. Would you still rock or recommend Hydrogen one phone as a good camera phone? Camera phone only. Can you compare photo quality with other phones? Thanks

Avishek Kushwaha	Will prefer the OP6 over the Op6T. I would like the headphone jack anyday over the indisplay fingerprint sensor.
Aditya Rawat	He said nothing bad about iPhone 10s and is nitpicking on one plus thats half the price or less. Surely bullshit.
Sujan Sharma	Huawei mate 20 pro's in-screen fingerprint scanner is insanely fast as compared to that of 1+ 6T
Josh Christiane	So far that's the least terrible looking notch on the market. Yeah I'd still prefer to not have one at all, but its curve is very gradual and not too harsh on the eyes. Very decent. Nice looking phone!

ExcaliburIgnited	Where can I find that mountain looking wallpaper? Looks sexy on that screen.
Mehtab	Sir , can I have link to wallpaper ?
Brian Haynes	Love the song..
Nishant Jain	Three things, we need the headphone jack, notification LED and normal fingerprint sensor. In display is too early and overall not so welcoming as you lose the ability to unlock using fingerprint only without pressing the unlock button, i.e. screen has to be on for on-screen fingerprint reader, which defeats the purpose of fast unlocking through fingerprint reader.

Ryku Tyrrel	What happened to no compromises? Damn. That's 2 phones now that could've been great: the Mate20Pro and now the 6T. Samsung and LG will be my options at this point. And no, Bluetooth is great until the built in battery deteriorates/dies plus you can't beat premium wired headphones unless you shell out ungodly premiums for it's wireless counterpart

Swanubhav Jain	Please do a camera comparison between OnePlus 6T, Pixel 3XL, iphone Xs Max, Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Huawei Mate 20 pro
Mr. L	If you aren't an extremely avid non-bluetooth headphone user, on a fool still trapped in iOS, this has got to be the best phone in ages. The minimalist bezel design finally perfected IMO, really adore the design. And the only compromises I see are: No headphone jack, not the literally best display (ie not Note 9, but still incredible display), not the literally best camera (but exponentially beter phone than the one with the best camera...) and the lack of headphone jack. But those I only put in there to prevent replies saying samsung screens are better and such, normally I'd just say this is the best phone of the past 2 years which cuts no corners   Edit: No expandable storage and more flex than I like to see during JerryRigEveryThing's bend test are also downsides. Still my pick of the year though.
emptyskullify	So what's wrong with the Oneplus 5T?
Jake Jenkins	Alright now I'm mad I got a Pixel 3

Lucas Luppi	The high brightness on the dark for the fingerprint is not minor to me. Thank you for sharing this. That's why I use the fingerprint reader instead of the iris scanner at night on galaxy phones.
weirdeyedkid ‚Ñ¢	The under the hood finger print scanner sounds like only a downside. My 5T scanner is INSTANT on the back of the phone where my finger already is and doesn't turn up my brightness. I also don't have to sacrifice my headphone jack for it. What if I need the Aux?
Jude Davis	K, I'm currently rocking the Pixel 2 XL. Here's the question üôãüèæ : should I upgrade to the Pixel 3 Xl or the One Plus 6T, or just stick with the Pixel 2 XL? Also, will it come with a headphone adapter?

mattheginger	This is basically an OPPO with a different SOC. It's looks alright, but I still don't trust giving my usage/communication and personal data to a chinese manufacturer.
mb the boss	storage improvement at same price was best move for me....for 1+ this will bring more customers
D Rock     75	My 5T is still going strong after a year of SOLID daily use, and I still love it! It still acts like it's brand new and I haven't had a single issue except when my fingerprint reader stopped working for a week or so, but it fixed itself and everything else is perfect.   One+ is kicking ass!
Rohindhran Nair	Anyone know what weather app is that at 1:03?
felix flores	I prefer the LG V40 Is more media hub , and That's very important for me.
viperz22	*Watching on my Essential Phone*  Still Loving my phone !!!
Technicfreak	Gonna order it in the first few minutes, still would‚Äôve liked a preordering system tho... And more colors... And a headphone jack... Still pretty much a no brainer for me tho
SYXX6_STREETWORKOUT	Phones are getting tad borring now , same designs and nothing new other that some little spec changes
Darin Barnes	Same features on iphone with a better battery for half the price
Shin Khant Aung Myint	I feel like the giants like Apple, Samsung and Google really needs to step up their game.
Omega Dan	Sigh... In the end, more companies will abandon the headphone jack in order to "allegedly" put new tech in. We are going to have to live with it down the line. I do like the tear drop notch, the best thing to get other than a full bezeless display. I'm excited for this and the xiaomi mi mix 3
Aldrien PHate	Seems will over used the power button everytime you unlock the phone? Or it activates the screen once tapped?
Eurovisio Song Contest Fan	So...after LG G6 i will buy this guy! I'm in love with OnePlus 6T
Supreme Nerd	Can you use a micro SD card in it??
Carlo Magsino	They couldnt put the head phone jack up top instead of getting rid off it ? maybe they couldnt? but Samsung do,i dont know.still like it though.
John N.	I have two things I want in my flagship. Headphone jack and no notch.
tiramisu	i dont understand unnecessary gimmick on screen finger print. why would anyone do that. the rear fp is already convenient and not hindered anything.
John Abraham	Why do people want the fingerprint reader on the front? The in-display reader is cool but it's more convenient for me to have the reader on the back because my finder is already resting there when I pull my phone out of my pocket so it's unlocked by the time I actually see the display.
Tshalan Here	New design ,same price üò≥
Amit Dey	Last phone for yiur techtover, So still for this month the best was Mate 20 Pro. Overall that has all big changes and features of true premium
Prabhu Palorton	MKBHDüáÆüá≥
Live Noteworthy	Does it have always on mode
Victor Ryan	Ports are becoming more and more obsolete. Things are getting more wireless and soon phone manufacturers will realize that having a charge port and wireless charging in one device is a waste of space, and they‚Äôll get rid of the charge port just like that.
UcHuK RaVeRX	still had ugly chin!! all android please..' get rid of that chin shit! after remove that shit, Android phones will become far way more beautiful than Apple iShit that already had that ugly notch!!
Dildacorn	It works on Verizon!!! :D

ItzStellar	Do you really need a selfie camera ? U could just use the back camera as selfie and have a second screen on the back of the phone to see what you are doing . Like that no more notch and still a pretty sick phone
Vlad TMS	A Notch is a notch...no excuses
Dani Wayne	Huawei still best !
cappy718	OP6 started at 529....OP6+ starts at 549...that's a 20 dollar increase.  Not the same.

Storm Jones	I want one of these, but I need VOLTE on AT&T.
Quentin Dollard	There's something pleasing about hearing him talk.
Robert Landrum	Battery champ? My Pixel 3 XL is at 80% brightness and I'm getting 7.5 SOT with a little over 10% battery left.  Consistently! Come on dude.
Lingaraj Dharwad	Own a OnePlus 5 and still don't feel compelled enough to upgrade. 5G is around the corner and OnePlus 7 or OnePlus 7t will surely have perfected the tech enough. Till this date Oxygen OS has never crashed, slowed the phone after upgrades. Camera is amazing and it's a company that has learnt the fine art of balancing user experience+features.    Speed, performance and how slim and light the phone feels are the key for me.   Would be interesting to hear from other OnePlus 5 owners on what their thoughts are.  Peace out.
My Gun Melts	Galaxy s10 is over any phone, dont @ me.
Jr arroyo	Subcribe to Pewdiepie, I'm doing my part are you
Na015110	no mention on it's software? im a tad disappointed
Antonio Santana	I'll pick 400mAh over the headphone jack every day!
Cornelius Puiulet	Love my 1+ 6.  Not enough of an upgrade with the 1+6T to switch, but I'm definitely in the 1+ camp for now
Yung goochy	JOE ROGAN
Mike Maddux	About the missing headphone jack - not a problem for me! I have wired headphones. I attached the dongle to the end of the headphone cord, and that's where stays. No muss no fuss. Also, since the DAC is now in the dongle, I can theoretically improve the sound by buying a dongle with a better DAC. I don't see a problem here.
Brandon	shout out reply all
Yello 01	why the chin???????????????????
Abdullah Al-Meshal	Thumbs up for Eminem Kamikaze üëç
haroon miah	Save ur money for the s10
mike Leos	i dont get how u only get 4-6 hours of screen on time on phones. I have the essential phone and currently have 4 hours and 2 minutes of on time with 42% battery remaining. this is pretty low for me but thats because i played a game for like 45 minutes today.
Stefan C	I'm just going to go ahead and say it, in-display fingerprint scanners are really gimmicky, and I think are just put there for the cool factor. From what I've seen, they're slower than before, less accurate than before and less secure than before. So worse in every way. They're cool, don't get me wrong, but not very functional, and not a long-term solution.
jon doe	At least 63k one plus fans
satyanarayana cr	Previously OnePlus used set a new technology standard now it is following others sorry OnePlus I think your creativity got sold to Oppo and ViVO
Tony S	Sounds like a paid promotion in parts.
DLZ	Looks like an S8/S9 when you cover the notch with a line üòÇ
Munaf Maknojia	Where's the iPhone XR review??? Like if you wanna see it?
Monoman2345	Was ready to name this the perfect phone, then you said no headphone jack... No phone can be perfect I guess. I would rather have a smaller battery
Chameleon Smith	Dude, what's that calendar widget you're using??
Cactus Tweeter	Wouldn't it be cool if OnePlus 6T came with stock android?
Nova Bastien	Finger print sensor under the screen? Wow! That cool! I bet if apple does it people gonna be like NEW INNOVATION!
user10476	This is the first descent notch I've seen. But I would still definitly hide it.
Rain man	Thank you for making the video in wide aspect ratio. Now it doesn't look like you're peeking in the window when I watch in full screen on Galaxy S9 plus :)
Baffa Usman	Gr8 review as always... thumbs up!
Oses	I love the notch and the bottom chin wish the OnePlus 6 which what I am rocking since I got in augest
PhantomWolf22	Hey Marques! I was browsing around amazon looking for good gaming tablets, and I stumbled upon a tablet that looks good and seems  reliable. but most of the reviews I seen on it are not as good I thought they'd be it cost 339.99 and is called JXD S192K Singularity I was wondering you could possible do a review on it? that'll be awesome!
Sai Nikhil Anna	where is xr giveaway

Moaaz A.	Suck on that Huawei.. They can't even sell in US.

poppet pala	*BEGONE* *_N O T C H_*
Flynn Denby	Why do people care about the headphone jack so much
Ashwaghosh Ghate	Realme 2 pro has the same design . Just it dosent have inscreen finger print scanner it has it on back and with glass back. Repair is so much cheaper
ak abraham	Note 9 is the best phone in 2018 so far I can confirm that.
Mike Hernandez	Loving the new video format
Preston Shewell	I'm gonna keep complaining about losing the headphone jack until it's not stupid anymore.
Damian Gabryelczyk	I wonder whats the point of selling a phone with bigger battery and more storage at the same price as the previous one. I mean the sale rate of one plus 6 will definitely drop
Johnizdaboss	Only $549 for a nice phone. Sounds better than spending a $1000+ dollars on a phone
riseandshinesunshine	I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I was an Android fan up when my android phone disappointed me big time. So I‚Äôve tried iPhone. Now after 3 years of IPhone although I can afford the Xs max I don‚Äôt see that the price justifies the package as an overall. I reckon in the end I will buy both and will see what satisfies me most :)
Joe Burns	As someone who has invested in wireless charging, it kills me that this doesn't have that.
L.E 01	i need that laptop background
Asher Smart	Loving the wide ratio aspect, man! Fits the s8 screen great.
Arfad Syed	No jack no buy
Amir Azmoon	I will go with 6 just because headphone jack is gone and finger print scanner is moved from ergonomic back to be integrated with the screen
NandoCarrasco	What do you think about Sony phones?
Ansh Chawla	That Casey Neistat T shirt
Kishore Ramachandramurthy	I wish you would do your review after using the phones for a fortnight. I think you are falling for the peer pressure,by doing it by using for less than a week. I still miss your previous reviews from 2016.
User Library76	So basically it‚Äôs just 7t?
J. H.	i mean same camera is pretty upsetting, thats not what i like to see in a 1 year progress.
Lohk's Channel	Samsung, LG and ASUS with headphone jack. Don't forget them. They're good
L Burke	No headphone jack, no thanks. Sticking with 5t plus that has headphone jack.
anandhu s nair	my next phone
Radical Edward	I hate android, but I‚Äôve been looking forward to this review because the 6T is a beautiful phone.
Evan N	S9+ is 600$ which is also a good dea that people might choose because IP rating headphone Jack and camera but this is still a great phone
James Harmson	Worth the upgrade over the OnePlus 5T?
Hunter Stegmeir	The 6t screen is so elegantly shaped
EnVadeh YT	Sadly 3.5mm headphone jack is going to go after about 2 years. We should go back to the 2.5mm jack.
‚ò¢ G-Zone ‚ò¢	That's the design that the Pixel 3 should've been but no......
Retro Online Emulator	To unlock need to press power then on screen fingerprint that works slow? I'm still happy with OP3
Frenchyk757	I didn't hear him mention if the phone is water resistant at all. Does anyone know?
Sillyrits	So it's half the price of an iphone X  but about the same quality with the exception of camera? Nice.

Krishanu Bag	Please giveaway me a Oneplus 6T
Reggie Chen	I don't like the notch üòäüòú
supboy666	Headphone jack for a bigger battery makes sense
Dominic Elizondo	Thought OnePlus phones were complete garbage.. might have made a tempting phone to check out
Edwin Hernandez	The main reason I switched from OnePlus to pixel 3 was the default messaging (SMS) app. With the pixel you can be in text group chats with iPhone users from the start while on the OnePlus you can't even be in text group chats with other Android phones, I'd receive and send messages individually and because of that I had to go with the new pixel
JellyBeanTV	*Apple has left the chat*
Swastik Swarup Das	I hate a teardrop more than iPhone notch. Not a Apple fanboy. I'm Android guy. But teardrop gives me Twitch in the brain
dxnw	i'm happy with my pixel2 still, it hasn't slowed down like yours did yet, but i would buy the hell out of this phone if i could afford it, i'd love to support them. water resistance would be cool though.
Manny Lapis	Snapdragon 845 üëå
dancho703	Hey Marques, I've got a question.. Can they just slow it down with the phone production? I mean this is getting annoying I feel like mobile are renewed every two month so you basically regret buying something expensive because in two month there's something new and better...
MissJayy	WOW, the Price?!! I mean way affordable price, and the notch is so much better here than the iphone. Smaller Notch is best so it doesn't take away from the screen.
Mikey H.	Bro, design your own phone and sell that shit. Give me 7% for the idea lol
Tyler	This is an impressive phone. They‚Äôve done well.
Fadzil ZA	Put it side by side with the pixel 3 xl. I wanna see the difference between affordable and expensive phone.
Will J	Kudos on having the smallest notch to date but I'm still not buying a phone with a notch.
Polygon Alley	Watching this on my OP3 still going absolutely great. I'd love to upgrade but, can I justify ¬£600~ for a phone I don't actually need?
drumtoe	What about Sprint?!
Jagger Leonard	Anyone wanna buy me this phone?
38feet	They're still weak on speaker quality.
Timur Dzhambinov	Happy I got my OP6 and didn't wait for 6T, still have the headphone jack, and not losing out on any performance)
Raf Redwan	wow ‚ô• loved it.
Bikal Thakur	That wallpaper üòç
Christian Lamey	Think I'll still keep my 3, guess we'll see how the 7 is, but no jack is depressing. I would trade battery life for the jack. Works on Verizon though is A+. Bout damn time with that.
maans le roux	I wish they can match the Pixel cameras. The industry really needs some competition to bring prices back to something reasonable

IAmBear.	Bluetooth earbud > wired. Fuck all you "no headphone jack" snowflakes
James Hierath	But does it have iMessage?
Anirudh Siddula	But I still want to play games while charging my phone. Removal of headphone jack is depressing. Atleast if they could have provided two usb cü§î.
H K	Certainly the next phone Marques!
Netcat	They nailed everything else, but these display fingerprint is not my thing I think is not that fast.
- backwoods	Im gonna switch from my OnePlus 6 to a iPhone XR
Stef Sums	Let's take a moment of silence for the headphone jack
Zephane	3.5mm is useless anyway, if you are using your phone you should just use the Bluetooth, and don't bother saying "wired has better audio" because if you are using your phone, you don't need superior audio! if you do then you should be on your computer or a laptop where you would need studio like quality. with wireless, it is still great audio, just everyone has bothered trying.
Rodrigo D√≠az	Mmm. They could have just placed the fingerprint sensor on the back and keep the headphone jack.
PWNcakesAndR0Fls	The notch looks like a nipple
Code N Flame	You didn't mention anything about the speaker lol
James	Damn they really need to stop making phones so damn big!!! I thought with the bezels gone phone sizes would go down
Igor Miguel Ribeiro de Sousa	Hi what do you think guys?  This phone oe Samsung S9 or S9 +? I am thinking buy a new phone.  Thanks
Brian He	You know the headphone jack is truly dead when OnePlus removes it... Rest in peace
rxmclaren7	why do so many brands like One+ and Xiaomi and others like them, go with carriers like AT&T and Tmobile and their GSM band? why do we not see more phones for Verizon?
keem shakes	i will stay with my iPhone 7+ till the next Samsung phone (2019).
Mohamed Cherif Boumaza	no jack no wireless charging  no quad hd display  no expandable storage no IP68 rating no telephoto lens no heart rate sensor no iris scanner  no S pen   no notification led no AKG headphones in the box  11 features the note 8 from 2017 has with no notch

Hu Ggu	I love this phone  I hate the video format mkbhd it' way too tall
Ambarin Khan	Why do people only care about op6t in screen finger scanner when the mate 20 pro has a much safer one. I don't understand.
Hyn Sum	OnePlus7 will probably get close to $700, bummer.
William Jones	Long time iPhone user.. making the switch to One Plus as soon as it drops.  I will always miss airdrop tho!
gentle musician	It think it looks same like vivo v11 pro which i am using

Nehal Sharan	Who else is watching this on the OnePlus 6?
MyNameIsJeff	can you still use the navigation gestures of the one plus 5t/one plus 6?   because with the new android you get that bar on the bottom where you can click back or home...      , and i love having full screen without onscreen buttons
Chris	Full Verizon compatibility (3G and LTE)?
blackzed	Dump apple folk's .
Adnan A	There are so many phones now it‚Äôs hard to keep up.
Batrax	1:10 Does anybody know where I can find that background and/or others like it?
Chris Zacharakis	So will this work on At&t in the US if I purchase directly from one plus?
Rejaun Manderson	This phone is amazing for the price so guys just forget about the headphone jack because it's going to go away eventually so go wireless
Nathan Ashby	Looks like a cool phone but I'm holding out for the Galaxy S10 Plus.
BigTank07	diss iphone, copies iphone called it innovation ~ Oneplus üòÇü§£
Cody Heatherly	Appreciate the 18:9 aspect ratio. Thanks Marques.
Denzel Karim	Is this one better than the Huawei P20 Pro???
salah eddine	THIS MIGHT HELP YOU WITH YOUR NEXT PURCHASE: today I left home at 7am with 99% battery, used 4g for the whole morning, I switched on gps in the afternoon along with the 4g ofc, brightness between 30 and 70% all day but spent most of the time outside, now I'm home and been using wifi since 10pm and now it's 00h59 am, currently the phone says that the screen on time since last full charge is 7 hours 1minute and I still have 19% of juice left, I'm a really heavy instagram, facebook and snapchat user, I do a lot of web browsing with 4g, and I also watched some videos on youtube today, I'm a oneplus 5t user, and as you may know or not, this phone is still a performance powerhouse till  this day, it just flies through apps and multitasks like a beast
iwishiwasanthony	I see that dolly 1:11
jordan benzoni	The only reason why i dont buy android is because of snapchat quality
Jason Yu	Until no other choice for a headphone jack, OnePlus will not be on my shopping list starting from 6T
raulrse	You have to press power button first, and then you can unlock it with your finger?? That's the reason I'll never buy this phone! They fucked it up big times!
NeoGee	0:59 Is that setting of making the wether app  icon as the current temp like that in AccuWeather somewhere or is that another app using AccuWeather's data?
Cherry	Why is everyone copying oppo's waterdrop notch??  Edit: first vivo then huawei, now oneplus??
Souf Rider	Xr review pls üòî

Cayden Thompson	I'm so stoked to get this phone through T-Mobile JUMP! Going to pick one up Wednesday when they are released! :D (Coming from a Galaxy S8 Active)
Omniknight	You don't actually don't have to turn on the screen to unlock the phone?
Kyle Kaufman	What is the name of the background on the phone? I see it everywhere on reddit and want to put it on my desktop and phone backgrounds but don't know what to search up
Neon Pigeon	Everything was great until the headphone jack... Why, Oneplus, WHY!
Rifraf	I know this is going to sound really stupid, but here we go...this phone looks great, and I want to get it, however, I use the headphone jack a lot and I don‚Äôt know if I can not use it. The two choices are to get the 1+ 6, or get this and hope the dongle works for me. Any suggestions for which I should choose?
Der Red	Probably not my next phone because it lacks a headphone jack which I use especially when my Bluetooth ones run out which is most days. Second reason is the lack of wireless charging. That being said I‚Äôm still on an iPhone 6 and it‚Äôs still working so I‚Äôm not chomping at the bit to fork over money for a phone I don‚Äôt need. Thus I have time to change my opinion about the lack of wireless charging and Jack and time for more phones to become available that are potentially better.
Arul Moondra	This just seemed a little biased.
Chan Min Kang	OnePlus 7, with an audio jack.     OnePlus will regret this and add it back. See the forum n Reddit.

Joshua Luther	I would buy this phone if I didn't still have payments on my S9 on Verizon. I also switch phones too often.
shivam shorewala	Oneplus has been shiftign more and more to a mass market phone which is sad as it is no longer sticking to what it is known for (for example no notification LED that they said everyone loved or the headphone jack or dual speaker) for a larger display to body ratio.

yan yan	Tnx for the information about that fingerprint reader( that the sensor is shining at night) !
stewie410	I'm just about to "pay off" my iPhone 6s 32G...and I've been getting real annoyed with iOS lately, and the crazy pricing that is flagships from Apple and others...so the Pixel 3/XL, and the 6T have been looking like the next model for me...and, also, my first Android phone to boot.  I'll wait for reviews to come out, because that's the smart thing to do...but man, even with a lack of wireless charging, the pricing and compatibility is still great, imo.
jay chow	parece que no te gusta xiaomi
3Danimationmaster	Best notch so far imo
Eden Hazard	Poco has the headphone jack, bigger battery, better and faster biometric scanner and an IR face unlock in full darkness This is the worst one plus phone I've seen. I'd rather get the OnePlus 6
orlando hernandez	Does the fingerprint reader works with tempered glass installed?
Gabriel	When is the side by side blindfolded camera comparison coming?
Smoothie Cris	Wauw
Steven Vaughn	Verizon compatibility???? Im listening.
Ini Ony	Prefer jack than on screen fingerprint
August Mcmahon	I think the fact that the Oneplus 6t now works on Verizon is an underrated feature, I would still be using my Onplus 3t if it had supported Verizion.
tsnorquist	No headphone jack, no buy.  OnePlus 3 owner / user here.

Hugo Ribeiro	5:30 *and Motorola
FistEnergy	Yup that's my next phone. Thanks babe.
Mr Thirty	Removing the headphone jack is such a shame because this phone looks great otherwise. Personally I don't like the alternatives like samsung but I would sooner move to them than be forced into using wireless headphones or god forbid a dongle
Milan Ditch	This phone is amazing for less than 600$ meanwhile iPhone have been the worse bang for the buck since the iPhone 6S
GeneralReticent	Can we please get a OnePlus 6T with Google camera and stock android that is always updated? Oh OnePlus, Verizon support would be cool at some point.
Sky	For me any notch is a deal breaker so im gonna stick with my redmi note 3 for another couple of years
neologics	What about the camera? Was it tested? Is it as good or very comparable to the Pixel?

CoolCarl33	All my boys vids on trending, keep up the good work @mkdhd
John Ramhos	All it needs for the next version is wireless charging and keep improving their camera and it's game on.
R2dabes	This is such a beautiful phone. I really hope to get one eventually ü§ûüèº
Earthgrand234	I'm mad that I didn't know it's now Verizon compatible....
Ravin Ray	It comes with c port headphone jack
The Deegster	one plus 6 #6 on trending
Aidan Perry	"What do you think, is this your next phone?"   No, I'm poor!
Yong Chi Lam	is it still splash proof?
dev646	Would very much like to c where OnePlus will go from here. They have updated step by step and have reached were other manufacturers are right now.   Waiting for next update.
Lizardcore	So no more unlocking the phone before having to turn on the screen
Ross Cabrera	I kinda like that notch
Darren Wood	Why are all these companies just handing sales to Samsung? Android users can choose any company, so when no headphone jack you just go to the next company. Apple users have to bend over because they won't switch to Android just buy what ever Apple gives them
Nicholas Kristianus	Got damn it oneplus, now what am I gonna do with my op6
„Å´„ÇÉ„ÅÇ„Ç®„Ç§„É™„Ç¢„É≥MeowAlien	Can I get a non front camera phone? I'm sure quite a lot of people would want that as they almost never use the back camera, let alone the front
D. Reyna	I think the fingerprint sensor os fast enough.
Kaitin Yip	do u get this tee from Casey?üòÅpretty cool
TheEpicCrumpet	Would love to get this but: a) don't have the funds/what funds I do have *will* be going on car parts b) don't trust myself with a fancy ass phone judging by how much I drop my current phone c) no bloody headphone jack haha
ShOok To tHe cOre	tbh, I rather spend a couple more hundred dollars for an iPhone 8+
Tanishq Dixit	Of course it is
Mitsuko Joy	@Apple
Denzel Dickenson	I just wish the bottom bezel with the same size and some top bezel. that's literally the only reason apple is winning in the design category it's like people do not know how to make something symmetrical.
Gerald Vargas	I don't like notches but if I had to pick a favourite it might be this one
Jesus Felix	#6 on trending
Brandocks	Well, I'm sold.
DEEPAK SHARMA	Hey, idk that you reply me or not!!. I wanna ask that which phone is better oneplus 6 or 6t. Like you have said that it is same like oneplus 6, bit confused!
hamzterix	Top phone to own in 2018: 1 Galaxy Note 9 2 Pixel 2XL 3 OnePlus 6 4 iPhone X Max (if under $1000) Any other suggestions?
Jordan Thompson	I'm liking the change in background colours this episode, those warm oranges and browns look good
Michael Dy	No one realizes how much it costs for production to put a hole for a headphone jack. This is why companies are dropping the headphone jack to save cost and the savings is passed on to the consumers.
TheZelkhan	If i was a android guy, id choose this
TechThatYT	Its soo ugly tho. Id rather have the one plus 5t
Fatoba Michael	Great and precise review. Thumbs up!
Jiang Bill	Seems like I have to stick with Samsung for life time.
Weicong Zhang	headphone jack isn't just space they could just make the phone just a bit more bigger to fit the headphone jack, they just wanted to sell USB-C headphone to make up the cost of there phone
gangstalishis	not a bad price, actually its very good.
Viknesh Venga	Review on mi mix 3 ?
PJ Quinn	giveaway?
Jose Marcano	How do you know you have a notification without the LED being there? And not touching or waking up the phone....?
drewigi	If my axon 7 hadn't messed up I would have waited for this phone since I have T-Mobile but instead I did the buy on get one free V30
Jayzee31519	549 for state of the art hardware? Wow, I‚Äôm faithful to apple but I have to respect one plus
Open borders for Israel	No headphone jack? Byeeee
Rihel Bhowmick	You should have talked about the "same" camera!
Sean VanGenderen	No wireless charging.... Come on!
Alexandre DILLY	Hey Marques, great new video !!! Which launcher are you using ! I saw you have Google now, round corners on Google search... Really like sick Pie...
marko marin	Do you know that Galaxy S9 have the same price of the op6t. Think about it , water proof, wireless charger and a better camera.
Jose Manuel Albaladejo	These tech youtubers always saying they lean towards the Pixel (2xl or 3) because of THAT CAMERA, but then use the OnePlus as a daily driver with its average (or even below average) camera... No Huawei mate, no S9+/Note 9...  They're fanboys, just like Apple's ones it's only they feel edgy not admitting it
Tanner Lack	It's my next phone
zlodeymk	Fingerprint unlock animation is horrendous.
Kllr_Lzzrd 21	I got an Ad for the iPhone Xs...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Don Schroeder	does it have wireless charging?
Mendy Goldshmid	Does that have to Google now launcher?
Sherman Mason lll	We‚Äôre not grateful for ANYTHING these days.
big Johnson	I'm gonna get it when they drop the white or red color so far it's only in black which is to common
Rusli Irawan	After watching this I can say Pixel 3XL is the ugliest phone of 2018
Dean Calhoun	y‚Äôall are seriously going on about the headphone jack when THEY SERIOUSLY PUT A FINGER PRINT READER UNDER THE GLASS IN A FLAGSHIP
Yuto Hamanaka	Man I wish they sold these in Japan. I feel like this phone would absolutely kill the other androids over in japan *sighs*
M. DABBAGH	Which is the best phone for 2018 please tell me which one you think it's no 1 ,ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î  iPhone xs Max or mate 20pro or note 9 or oneplus 6t
Israel Reynoso amado	I really like that phone. I might get it. I also Own an iPhone
Mas Pras Channel	NO headphone jack, no charger port, no phone, just communication with your head. Yeah Future!
Adrian Bryce	Now there are 2 ads before I can watch this video
Heroman	Gotta see you cover the Mi Mix 3!
Kei Kurono	do you really need 8gb ram in a phone??
flowerdemon	No headphone jack + fingerprint unlock becomes a two-step process
LotsOfLogan49	Marques, you should do an iPhone 5S Revisited video. That would be fun to watch!
jan rodriguez	1 mil views in 7 hours... THERES LEVELS TO THIS YOUTUBE SHIT
Concept Creator	not buying it... they made it thicker for the battery... they should own up to it and say we did it for the bullet headsets which we got back in stock when we announced that the headphone jack will be gone... not that hard to be honest
Ahmad Bitar	*Steve Jobs has entered the chat*
Th√©o Schneider	I drop a like for the "notch pun"
Greg  S	Google I can't decide if I love you more than I hate you at this point. Step it up. üò≠
sherri bartz	Don't believe
DaDudeMaestro	I feel like more YouTubers should follow the 18:9 uploading, I was so taken aback by going full screen and not pinching to zoom üòÑ
Trindade CR7	Wireless üëé, 3.5 Jack üëé, iP68 üëé, Huawei Mate 20 Pro The Best ‚òùÔ∏èüîãüì∏‚òùÔ∏è
Siddharth Dhingra	Please share this wallpaper
Dom Rob	I like how notches are important for people to learn now lol ridiculous
Christian Vaughn	I don't think I'll get rid of my 5T anytime soon now that the fingerprint scanner is under the display. Having it on the back where my finger naturally goes is just much more efficient compared to the front of the display
Nilesh Dharmadhikari	Can the gestures on this one be compared to iphone? I really want a big screen phone with those gestures. The iphone XS Max is too expensive :)
Hitesh Rathore	this vs mi mix 3, please review mi mix 3
Siris	I just want to know how do you feel when your video showed up during the launching event.
utubedano	Why have the fingerprint sensor underneath the screen when it was perfectly fine behind the device.  Nice new tech but unnecessary. At Least have them both so we can use it either way. üò¨
Paul Demarco	Where can I get that t shirt?
ssjdeadpool1227	Pixel 3/3XL or One Plus 6T?
PRIME	Lmfao he called the animation corny, bruh I would let someone punch me in the face rather than get called corny. It‚Äôs a good phone though
Wayne Aprato	Pretty poor how the lack of notification led is brushed over at 1:34 then never mentioned again. The lack of AOD is also not mentioned which is pretty important given that there's no notification led.
Leonard Reles	Im actually surprised you find this notch weirder than the other one you showed... I love this design and while watching your video I already got used to it.
Windsrave3	Does it still have the notification LED?
Recoo Recoo	Review Huawei mate 20x pls
levi nouah	I personally would prefer a headphone jack than a larger battery and inscreen  fingerprint reader just because of convenience. The fingerprint reader seems like a gimmick while the larger battery is more practical, the battery isn't a whole lot bigger and for sacrificing the jack it just seems to not be worth it for the amount of hassle I have to go through to use my headphones. Given that OP6 has dash charging, I don't really see the point of a 'bigger' battery either since most people have powerbanks or access to a powerpoint sometime during their daily lives. Overall i'm just disappointed that OP decided to follow the market trend despite saying they listen to the customers.
Helder De Almeida	Marques doe it work in England?
Murtuza Bhabhrawala	I can not afford to buy any of these expensive flagship phones but still I watch every video like I will buy it immediately
Christopher Youse	I plan it being my next phone.
MegaUltraSuper‚Åì99	Just proves that Google and Apple aren't trying. OnePlus is rightfully embarrassing the big smartphone companies.
jericho faustin	I love your unboxing and review diff. tech. you deserve many subscribers
Lyndon  Cobb	Aye I think I'm in love yall
Michael	Better than Apple.
Jonibravo	NÃ∂EÃ∂VÃ∂EÃ∂RÃ∂ SETTLE. You lost a loyal customer today.
smugtakagi	Some of you need to get over the fact MKHBD didn‚Äôt care much for the mate 20 in an IMPRESSIONS video, not a review. The mate ain‚Äôt even available in the US and it‚Äôs not even out yet
kierenkd	Junk.   i.   worse audio outputs/ inputs with loss of headphone & mic jack than the last phone. ii.  worse fingerprint reader iii.  not IP6x rated iv.  No camera improvement  The only + is the larger battey
Mohamed Yosof	Wallpaper?
Louis Sanchez	Bruh!!! You should've opened with the Verizon bit. Like, that's a huge amount of people that can now use a one plus phone, including myself. I just bought a Pixel 2 XL almost 2 months ago and love it still, but this makes me consider trading it in for this. Seriously, this is a big deal for Verizon users like me.
Jose Cardenas	Love the aspect ratio you shoot at, can finally watch it full size on my phone. Thanks!!!
Unclejerry50th	Google just needs to slap the pixel logo and camera on this thing and call it a day
Shammu Meyyappan	What's up with the new aspect ratio? seeing the black bars gives it a weird film vibe I don't think meshes well with a tech review. great video regardless
Faiz Rahman	will they still sell the 6 at the same time
18matts	One plus should build the next pixel. Get htc out
Nancy Dolman	Nice phone
Erin Cano	Still rocking the Op3 üí™üèΩ
RottenSalad	Am i the only one with a nokia?
Ryan Olsen	Do you get a lot of people trying to look over your shoulder to see what phone you're using? Maybe even taking pictures of you with your phone? People can't wait to see new phones, and even a two day leak would excite some. About the jack; I'd like to know what Zack over at JerriRigEverything has to say about there not being enough room. There usually is.
sevan grigoryan	Was about to switch over to the 6t until he said they removed the jack on this too. That killed it for me
Franco Verona	I am definitely buying¬†this phone. I only hope that it¬†works with the¬†Japanese networks.
Ariana Grande	but the One Plus 6 came out jus last month :/
Nancy Femmer	Great review, you said it plan and clear.  Why does some phones have a non removable batteries?  Once again thank you for this information ‚ò∫
Arceus Eevee The Shiba Inu	In-display fingerprint sensor is far slower than the traditional fingerprint scanner. You can definitely notice the gap between scanning and unlocking. Not a good job OnePlus. You should not have release a "T" this time. So disappointing.
Bkheang	does anyone know about how fast this will sell out on thursday?
C Otter	Can you link the wallpaper please!
Santiago Tumale	I really think the animation couldve been a a padlock unlocking
Brenden Brenden	Lost respect for the dude after his incompetent Huawei review.
Jayson Perez	Killing the headphone jack and only focusing the software updates on the their latest phones. They really do listen to their customers.
peter parker	I hate all kind of notches but this one is not  ugly!
Noah hunter	How did you hide it in public?
Pranjay Patil	MKBHD please bring back 16:9, current aspect ratio feels like there are added bezels on my phone. Thank you.
Katy Spencer	I don't think I will go for the 6t, the no headphones is a real drawback, and to make it work I'd need the 100+ airpods. After this realease I think I will go get a 5t or a 6 though since my 3t is on its last legs
Tavo Mena	I don't understand the rush on this bezel less race, give me a notification led, give me dual front speakers, give me proximity sensor, give me a front fingerprint scaner like the Moto G6 or the recent Huawei Mate, I don't want accident touch madness like the iPhone X üôÑ
Jacob Votava	no headphone jack? no money given.
JoshOfficial	Go to my SoundCloud: JoshIsland@ ‚ùÑÔ∏è.
GIllyMoMo	So is Moto...their X series still has them.
Sean O	So nit picky about the finger print reader. ü§£ü§£ Geeze man.  You are losing it.
Matthew Petersen	OnePlus is the best value smartphone hands down. They check all the boxes.
Dan G	Come on that fingerprint scanner is rapid!
Adnan Khaliq	You got a wallpaper link for me???
niamaru2	In Canada $699 for the 6 $749 for the 6T :(
xs3tsunax	"it takes so much space" THEN MAKES THE PHONE BIGGER!!!!
buddhacalls	Solid video, hate it they removed the finger print sensor on the back. Faster and convenient. Oh well one plus and their design choices
Isaiah Barry	should i buy the OG essential phone?
Albert Tien	Wallpaper pls?
Dadapapa	What‚Äôs with the aspect ratio? Did MKBHD go 21:9 friendly all of a sudden?
Abdulrahman awad	Wallpaper?
S- MUSIC	Its sad cuz im watching this on a htc desire 530 who is trash and i cant afford this T6,and i want to cry.
Sahil Pethe	Does anyone here know about the MI Mix 3? That's the best phone anyone can purchase. It's a shame not many people know how amazing it is.
gang gang gang gang	I wonder how many Iphone users are like " dang, Android are ACTUALLY better than Iphones..."ü§î
Jesus Catlin	Blink every time you open the phone
Josh Takacs	VERIZON COMPATIBLY!?!? dammit i dont need another phone. Have a xs and a note 8. That 6t looks awesome!   My wallet is üò≠
MPRF12345	The Ss in the audio are not that great... But I only noticed it in this particular video :|
ibrahim maqbool	Please review mi mix 3
Thomas Acker	Is it fully waterproof yet?!??
Harsh Zintoo	I would definately buy it over iphone xs if i had the money üòÖ
Logesh Muresh	Can review mi mix 3??
Papa Pumphrey	I want that fingerprint reader effect on the 3T  T_T (I don‚Äôt have the money to buy a 6T)
Ren√© Villela	Yes. I'm buying it
Thekukills	OnePlus 6 owner here.  Bought it for 2 reasons. Price. Jack.
ali adel	Is it worth upgrading to this from a s8?
Robert Mcfarlane	better phone or headphone jack? ü§î
Touhid	One plus two plus three plus blah blah blah finally buying iPhone or galaxy. It is nothing but  truth .
Edward Ho	Comes with silicon case, don't need a skin thanks.
Izzul Safwan Aripin	What is your wallpaper??mind to share?
Wan Ori	Goodbye pixel3XLü§£
CEO	No wirless  No QHD display
BEASTMACHING	Aye yo Chief, where are you?
Brian Underwood	5T best design of 1+ so far
Hayden Williams	If I was an Android guy I‚Äôd definitely go with One Plus.
PizzaHut Honoka	Apple fans: Fingerprint sensor in screen? I dont need that my phone screen will get smudged.  *Apple 11S Max released with in screen fingerprint for $1200*  Apple fans: I love it and Apple does it better.
kendokaaa	Quite an inoffensive notch. Without a chin I'd definitely almost like this display
urbanmystify	The OP6 starting price was USD529 though, but yeah same pricing for the other versions.
Nf4 Industries	Add Lenovo/ Motorola and Asus to that headphone jack list. Still loving my Lenovo P2 and I am looking at the Moto One Power as a potential upgrade.
barry shaw	One plus 6 was this year not last year!
Robert Theoctarian	I got the add
H Boogie	I don't mind losing the headphone jack in replacement for a bigger battery.
Akash Saha	Dat wallpaper link please. (P.S- Great video)
GLR	The notch is well designed, tasty
Dominik Roszykiewicz	@MKBHD Iron your T-shirt next time;)
hitman1365	Oneplus: Bigger battery, gotta get rid of the headphone jack.  Samsung: F*ck that noise! Here's a big battery, a headphone jack, and a big ass pen.
Muhammed Khaled	Should we buy iphone 10 now or not?
Rolijok	I don‚Äôt think you give this phone quite enough credit. Fingerprint reader is super cool, one of the first major brand to have an under the screen reader. Notch is way smoother than either the pixel or the iPhone. Price is awesome. I think this is (so far) the best phone released this year.
fox.	i feel poor with my pixel 2 xl
Jett Pesson	I honestly think the finger print read animation is awesome.
Flor Debois	Nice detail: The 4 sixes in the bodem right corner in some shots of the video
akowalz	iPhone XS owner here.  That's a nice looking phone.  I think the notch actually looks really dope.  If I were looking to buy a cheaper phone and switch to Android, this would definitely be a top contender.
Grayson Greene	My life is so hard. I thought I only had to decide between the Pixel 3 XL and the Note 9, but now the OnePLus 6T? Woe is me, I am so torn.
Mateusz PƒÖpka	Is that fingerprint reader works only for unlocking or it works also to securing files like standard fingerprint reader ?
scrd	Watching a video of yours is so aesthetically pleasing it's insane.
ReedMG	#6 on trending. Coincidence? I think not.
Divine Zeal	To be honest i love bluetooth headphones. But for real, not many cars have bluetooth yet and thats a true shame lol. Also you cant plug your phone into a bigger speaker, a mixer, or many other 3.5mm applications...  -A happy galaxy s7 owner.
CreateTech	watching this on my Oneplus 6. I should have waited :L
Untold Truth	I think the 6 is better than the 6t I mean....that headphone jack, faster biometric unlock, same camera, better speaker etc, if I was looking for a new phone I would but the 6 over the 6t
FiveSquaredYT 25	One mil within 6 hours! How sway!
NERPolitan	I'd rather have a smaller battery with a headphone jack
Shay Lu	Nice Casey shirt. :-)
606gus.	Any rappers/singers who want to work with a new producer, pick a beat from my channel and I'll get it to you asap. Let's work, Stay blessed üíØ
Daniel Garcia	Pixel 3 or OP6t?
Ian Buck	Does the fingerprint sensor still activate when you're logging into an app like LastPass? It would have to essentially draw the bright glow over the app, right?
Jordan Hibshman	Is this phone with AT&T?
Ethan Smith	Your tending in the UK
Darkskull07	Does anyone know where I can download the wallpaper at 2:23?
Kai Behrends	I'm torn between the OnePlus 6T and the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3. Waiting for some more reviews of both.
Andy Man	I have owned 3 OnePlus phones to date (the 3, 5, and 6) and was going to purchase the 6T as I was watching this video. But as soon as you said there's no headphone jack I closed T-Mobile's website and OnePlus' website. If there's no headphone jack I'm not interested, plain and simple.
Stefan Kort	For those who are looking for the wallpaper in this video: download the 'Walli' app and look for 'forest sunset'. You will find it there
Alexander Song	Finally Verizon support. I'll have to think long and hard about this or the Note 9 at a steep discount.
like I Care	Add more subtle fingerprint animations. Those are not nice
logic madness	I chose mate 20 Pro. No regrets even if 1+ looks very promising
RenZo	I've been waiting for this for a long, long time.
apexiology	awesome video as always. can i have the wallpaper link? thank you
rip x tentacion	better than the Xr shitty display
mrk107	1:22 Teardrop? I thought it was a nipple.
JAme J	R.I.P X
Dai Thach	Keep the fingerprint scanner on the back!!
Alejandro H. Cruz	I just wish they also made a compact version!
banoffee234	i smashed my iphone 7 should i get this it looks nicee
Martian Mellon	I love the wide videos
ThatSameer	Is the top earpiece doubling as a tweeter?
The Cheshire Cat	If only it had wireless charging I'd probably have picked it over the pixel 3 XL but that phone just ticks all the right boxes for me. Maybe next year I'll finally come back to OnePlus.
Haron Gathu	so, cap, back to RDR...
Jacob Friedman	Since the fingerprint scanner is using the OLED display could it eventually cause burn in?
Charles McCormack	Love the animation with the finger print!!  Looks AWESOME! Samsung was late to that party.  Suprising ios didn't beat them to market.
Jordy Angkawidjaja	This is how google pixel 3 should looks like
Helmy Fadilah	Top list!
Lee Trumbull	With more and more phones giving up the headphone jack, is there any dongle out there that splits the port so that the phone can be charged and use a headphone jack at the same time? People can upgrade to Bluetooth headphones, but I can't just upgrade my car to have Bluetooth. Maybe this is an old car problem, but my car doesn't have Bluetooth and I'm not going to mod it. Plugging my phone in isn't a problem, so why are there seemingly no ways to charge and listen over 3.5mm at the same time.
NooB Express	And I just bought the normal one plus 6
Nintendork	Why would you need face or fingerprint unlock when you're alone with the phone with you at home? Just disable those.  I disabled all this BS on my S9, no unlock gizmo, If I need the phone to be near family, friends and don't want them to have access the device, password code.
Angel kabane	I will consider buying a phone with no headphone jack whenever they make wireless headphones that last at least a whole day not 2 or 3 fucking hours.
AAa m	I dont regret getting my lg g7 now, its not the best but it has a lot of the things im looking for. Just wish it had dual sim on it, just so when I go overseas I wouldnt have to swap my sims. The battery isnt a big deal to me either, I use a crappy lg fiesta 2 that has a 4500mAh battery to stream videos on it and play games.
Ben Aspey	at that same price you get 2 less gigs of ram than the 6
Í∏∞ÌòÑ Arikadou	Funny how we all already know what it will look like, 3 months before it released xD (Oppo/Vivo F/V and R?)
Prasanth Sasidharan	Yes it is my next phone, bye Apple forever!!!
Jason  L√∂wen	Can someone tell me where he got this wallpaper from?
RAZENOID	OnePlus 60
punisha007	Is that an official wallpaper? If not, can you link it?
pin pon	Will Marques be covering the Military Mix 3? It has a good camera.
Bawono Budi	"Never Settle" by taking out the headphone jack and installing slow fingerprint reader that apparently takes up space. Bleargh.
„Å™„Åø	Wow 7th on trending
TheSpector	Thought about getting this phone...until I heard it has no headphone jack...better luck next time...
Alvi Islam Khan	That wallpaper link?
Prime Daniel	Your shirt looks like it just came out of the washer ,wrinkled .Thats pretty much the only fault I saw in this amazing video.Great work Marquez ,you seem to continuously  amaze us all with your crispy and attention to detail videos.Thank you and keep up the good work
Marcel Klappert	Yeah right, the headphone jack is history because of the bigger battery and the in display fingerprint reader. Why the hell does the notchless Vivo Nex S feature a bigger 4000 mAh battery,  a in display fingerprint reader AND still comes with the headphone jack. The phone is also thiner than the OnePlus 6T.  Must be magic, right? Never settle my ass OnePlus!
Live Maschine Tutorials	Never settle for no headphone jack.
Ian Roach	Switching to Samsung because i'm not "Settling" without a headphone jack. Bite me.
Atef turki	5:45 i call bullshit ! samsung with it's note series can fit a hovering pen digitizer, a pen, a headphone jack, a big battery, and a fingerprint sensor along with the other components, what are they doing then? magic? edit: AND A BIXBY BUTTON!!
Gabriel Klein	No stereo sound, no IP rating, no headphone jack, no wireless charging, crappy camera, I'll pass.
JB	same price with expanded storage + incremental new tech - headphone jack.. bang for the buck!!
Dayprotraders	Yes, this my next phone indeed.
MW2mostwanted	The notch look way better than the apple notch and especially the pixel 3 notch
Nikhiel Padhiar	I really wish OnePlus would just start to release one phone a year instead of two. The 6t should have been the 6.
Chengwu Su	My next phone!
Matthew Gallardo	That cool so the oneplus 6t has 128gb and its basically 500 i would get it
Change in 3D!	This is the best notch design i've seen so far. I don't like notches, but when they are really necessary, I prefer this decent beautiful rounded cutout over those like the abomination of the Pixel 3 XL
Viking Tortilla	I'm not going Oneplus Phones anymore. You get rid of the 3.5? I'm not buying your phone.
Summer Adeline Wong	What if the camera is inside the display? If it's invisible? It would be *amazing*
Ben Whittle	No wireless charging, no deal. Seems silly they don't have it, especially since it's a glass back with NFC already....
Hendra W	techtober is end? lol i guess this video suppose to be out when one plus event still at 30 oct.
Pavel Pekun	OnePlus time is out.
Geeky hawk	Hey! Please consider this.  People with 18:9 aspect ration can zoom in and out to adjust their screen . People with 16:9 ratio phones can't zoom in at all.  Why not make it in 16:9 but shot in a way that it looks perfectly fine when zoomed in to fit a 18:9 screen.
Liviu Preda	Do you have to press the power button before unlocking with the fingerprint?
Pawe≈Ç Fabiszewski	Actually this botch is... pretty :)
Ray J	I think the gestures are a lot better than the iPhone
Josh L	Wow Pie really ripped off the iPhone‚Äôs gestures ...
X	Hit like for kamikaze
thiccy boi	I really like what one plus does with their phones but I just don‚Äôt like notches. Do you think this notch is easy to get over, and does the hide notch option actually make it look like theres no notch?
lyles music	I thought his pixel 3x l was his daily driver lol üòÜ
Ed Gob	My Jailbroken iPhone 6s Dominates Any Normal iPhone and Destroys Any Androids Frankly AMAZING can't wait for iOS 12 JB Omg =]  SO HYPED
Comp3630	Yes, this will be my new phone. Goodbye Apple.
Harrison Ryan	iPhone XS is spectating
Hossein Malakalaie	Love it!
Shafin Ahmed	Marques also rocking with "lucky you"!.... definitely one of the best tracks of the year
Matthew Libo-on	Should I buy a 6 or 6t? I'm bummed about the headphone jack and the in display fingerprint but it aside, its good
TheXylis	You didn't even mention the fact that it's got Corning's gorilla glass 6 for the display?
Jaheem Smith	No headphone jack, interesting...      DEAR SAMSUNG : WHAT'S UP ?
Patrick Johnson	The OnePlus 6T is the PERFECT PHONE! Better specs than the iPhone X series at only $549 starting! If only the headphone jack was still there...
BenjAmin Hoang	Can oled produce infared or some other non visible light in order to userp the night unlock problem
Jason Edwards	Personally I'd take the Pixel XL notch over the tear drop notch if I had to choose.
Stefan Constantinescu	500$ V30  - 2k Oled Screen - IP68 - wireless charging - way better camera : photo&video - better battery life ( 93h vs 90h gsmarena )  - Quad DAC  - HDR10 compliant - Always-on display - microSD card Slot - Headphone JACK - Ultrawide camera - extremely usefull - Stereo FM radio with RDS  And that is 2017 Flagship If we compare it to 2018 flagships : Mate 20 Pro, Note 9, Lg V40, Iphone Xs etc etc IT KINDA LOOKS  LIKE MIDRANGER
Artjon Frades	Wallpaper link please
jhhu	what if the headphone jack comes back in the one plus 7
Barak Cohen	I think that if they could to make the screen without the notch it was more attractive to me , but pixel 3 xl or 6t the answer is totally 6t
Henry Chiang	All the comments about having no headphone jack üòÇ get with the times Jesus üòÇ but really though phones should start coming with 2 multifunction USB C jacks that allows charging, reverse charging, music output and file transfer etc
Sam Walker	Dude wide format is awesome
Cleber Machado	That notch is gorgeous!!!!
Anorkhil	I threw up a bit in my mouth when i saw the notch. . . . mi mix 3 please, all day any day
CTRL F Gaming	I‚Äôve lost faith in Oneplus... My OP6 back cracked by itself. That‚Äôs ok, glas and everything - s*it happens.   Then they drop an update that is absolutely terrible: camera crashes, fingerprint issues and the pictures I do get to take is of potato-quality most of the time. So I had to roll back to Oreo, but the terrible camera quality stuck.  To top it of my carrier informs me there is an issue where I can‚Äôt call two of the emergency numbers in my country on 4g/wifi with OP devices, with no estimated time for a fix. I was so happy with it the first couple of weeks and now I‚Äôm so annoyed with it. Question is - is their push for a new release taking the efforts from fixing their 6 months old flagship?
Kimali Bennett	I literally had my one plus 3 for over a year and had bluetooth headphones for about 6 or 7 months and never missed my jack. then I went through a  bunch of different phones,(iphone 8, oneplus 6, lg g7, pixel 2, pixel 2 xl, iphone 5se) and i still dont care about the headphone jack. you guys realize these are literally personal problems right?
Zachary George	So many phones.... Pixel 3 or OnePlus 6t or Note 9? HELP (Currently have the Samsung galaxy s7 edge)

Run Lefty Run	What about the nano SD card
Danaldinho	Do you have to click the power button every time you want to unlock it? Or can you just pick up the phone then put your finger on the fingerprint scanner?

Rob monde	can these old farts stfu about the headphone jack. You can literally buy a blutooth head phone from amazon around $30.00 . The jack takes so much space.

Zdenƒõk Marek	PLS GIVE US THE WALLPAPER I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE
Bret Huisjen	I don't think that in-glass finger print is just not any more convenient. Seems like a gimmick to me
Johndoe	Everyone who is complaining about no headphone jack needs to calm down, and heres why 1. If you use aux, there is a dongle 2. Oneplus bullets wireless are the best Bluetooth earbuds ive ever heard of and only cost $69 3. Bigger battery 4. Even if you dont have or plan to get 2. Bluetooth headphones sound a lot better than plug in headphones UNLESS, you have a hifi dac, which almost 0 smartphones have (lg does) 5. Saying you dont have the money to buy Bluetooth headphones is irrelevant because of how cheap this phone is and how cheap the bullets wireless are.  6. In display fingerprint reader (kind of a gimmick, i probably just would have preferred it on the back but its cool and works

Aaron Dior	almost had me until it said no wireless charging.
Mihai Vulcan	What about sound? Still bottom speaker? Still 1 speaker? Honestly...it's a software trick anyway to make the earpiece shoot some sound...

Erika Martin Taylor	Seeing the specs offered at those prices makes me even more disappointed in the Pixel 3 :(  Pending the camera is decent, this sounds like it'll be a fantastic phone to have!
xhimiz14	I'm thinking of selling my S8+ and get this one. Any feedback here in the comments ?
SeaHome	definitely upgrading from my Oneplus 2 to this. Cant beat the value of Oneplus.
Lurker	Looks like it's gonna be the Xiaomi mi mix 3 for me.. That notch, no wireless charging repels me, and the slidey slide on the mix 3 entice me
Armaan Tornow	Do these people who instantly turn it down because of lack of 3.5 jack not realize they are gonna run outta phones?
Marwan Ragab	Does it unlock without turning on the display (without pressing the power button)?

AftermathXJ220	No wireless charging,  No water resistance,  No MicroSD expansion slot, No QHD display,  No headphone jack,  No wide aperture camera,  No dual speakers,  No Dolby Atmos, No stylus,  No ecosystem,  Not compatible with my smart devices at home, Calls to "Never Settle" & yet settles for copying other manufacturers mistakes.  Fast charging kills the battery quicker, so it's nice in a pinch, but not for everyday use. Flagship killer for half the price my a**! but has a notch. All these phones should be half the price of what they retail for. If it costs Apple, Samsung, etc. About $200-300 to manufacture a flagship device, why is the retail 3-4x as much.
Samuel Reitenbach	The phone is amazing but the bottom chin and how it's thicker then the sides just destroys the whole look
Dr. Jekyll	How is it that one plus makes better design phones than Google a Multibillion dollar company
TJ Lime	Still a notch, totally unusable.
Luk√°≈° Pa≈æout	Love watching your new format videos on S8 screen :)) great choice! :)
unicamentejean182	No headphone jack means fuck off  But nice phone, tho :)
DjStiv3	God notches are fucking stupid and annoying.  Leave the damn top and bottom bezels. Live galaxy line for this s8 and s9 are perfection.  Just give me dual fucking speakers. Goddamn assholes. One thing thats missing

DarkLight	6T Has facial recognition but not 3d facial recognition and on screen fingerprint - and marques likes Mate 20 pro Has 3d facial recognition and on screen finger print - but marques dumps it.
Rayyan Mistry	Ahhhhh he listens to Royce da 59   He‚Äôs got great taste in music
K C	When you get a new phone, what do you do with the ones you used before?
Quartz Nation	Magic 2, no notches, wireless fast charging, 3.5mm jack, on screen fingerprint scanner, sliding camera like mix 3, checks all the boxes.
egypshun03	Love the phone but I could never use a phone that doesn't have wireless charging again. No going back
hei√∞inn	Would rather have a headphone jack vs. a finger print reader.
Yakub soldad	6T on 6th T

OfficialRhysus	I hate the cameras get damn better because one plus cameras are shit
Stealthy23	The real question is.. What Wallpaper is that??!?!üòç
222jese	That's why I don't like the iPhone x, it looks just like any other new phone
pancakemix 707	Record on full screen on pixel 2xl???? Nice
Atlas	NO JACK, NO BUY. (I'm sorry but I am not gonna bend to this rule and if everyone does the same I am positive they will stop removing it) Customer must be king
Carmilla Wong	It's a decent upgrade from the Oneplus 6 but it's not by much. Still no wireless charging, what a bummer. A cool phone to upgrade for those who still hasn't upgrade their phone for years tho. The specs really sweet for the base mode. 6G with the 128G. Great deal!
lukino805	You compare the notch with Essential Ph-1, but when you mention the battery, you don't compare it? I have the Ph-1 and I get 6-8 hours of SoT which is more than what you said. I'm really sad about the fate of Essential company. I think it's reviews like yours that caused the phone to be bad seller. And it didn't deserve it. Camera was a flop? Maybe. I don't know how to judge that. But there were many people who said that it's now way better with the software updates. It is as fast with updates as Pixel phones.  I hope there will be some new as brave project with more luck.
Noah Ryden	that is pobably my next phone since i will be getting a new one soon
TrollskieTV	If this phones camera is better than GP3XL then I'm sold  Edit: Still the same cam, but since it may be getting direct Verizon support its back in the fight
T.E.D. de Medici	5:15 it's amazing that Huawei on its Mate 20 (non-pro) can keep the headphone jack and s bigger battery than OnePlus can.
AFist Gaming	Is it IP certified?
Sam the Ham	iPhone XR has left the conversation.
ravi kanth	No review about the pathetic camera. The camera is the most disgusting feature of the one plus phones. Have been using one for two years now. Doubt the genuinty of the paid review.
Michael Carver	If the Verizon model will work on straight talk then this may be my next phone
Praveen Nair	It's lame that you gotta turn on the screen then use the fingerprint sensor.
DEL	5T for life
Alan Thompson	I‚Äôd say take my money right now, but my wife and I actually use wireless charging all the time. Little pads throughout the house, and our car chargers are both Qi too. Argh.
Slobodan Nikolic	wallpaper?
SenoreQueso	Another day, another big, expensive phone without a headphone jack and a notch. Wow, so remarkable. Such innovation.
Michael Taylor	OnePlus have finally Settled.
Jeff Louzada	MKBHD with the fire as usual üî•
Hugo Sousa	Well ... at least he wears colors well ... and admits his preference... Except for the fingerprint ... e still prefer the mate 20 x ... better camera ...sound ...screen ...battery ...gps .... reception ...cooling ... and AI .... soo maybe some underline in the ‚Äúbest‚Äù android phone needs to be well perceived...
Hunter Thorne	I have no problem with notches, but no headphone jack is a killer disappointment...
jhugo1986	Just shut up and take my money! Serious bang for buck! Cant think of anything else to get for that price.
manuel munguia	Why does this video have 2 black bars at the top amd the bottom?it looks weird on my smartphone.
J L	THE NEISTAT TEE! <3
DShaker24	Here's what I want to see in OnePlus 7 that I really feel 6T missed out on : waterproofing, wireless charging and Super VOOC (0-100% charge in 31 minutes). If they could bring 3.5mm jack back, awesome. That's literally all I want to see added.
Jason Gr	not your best review, in my opinion. Others were more enthusiastic and provided more details. It is taller now and thicker and more heavy, which is an issue for many people who prefer lighter smaller phones
Majd Abokassab	Mate 20 and 20 x Notch I love that
GSHeverything _27	I heard it's coming to T-Mobile
Eric Sharp	My 2 cons fingerprint reader is a downgrade and no headphone jack

El Cucuy	I like that shirt. üòé
robert anderson	damn would buy this, but im stuck on ios :(
Abdalrhman	Lack of headphones jack , no more notification light , slower FP sensor , nah i don't think that's worth upgrading from my oneplus 6 not even from  5t
Menuka Munasinghe	Hey you keep saying "Volume" when you talk about screen real estate when you should say "Area". JS
Esben Fuglsang	Lucky You üòé
smrr2	i would like to know why there still is no wireless charching, glass semms like such a bad material compared to aluminium
Cosmin Gurau	I'm gonna stick with my POCOPHONE F1, lol. Better in every way, except maybe screen and design, and almost half the price of this phone.
Milan Bharadwaj	Ayyyyyyy Kamikaze <3
DCMJ	Pocophone serves me quite well. Cheaper, 4000 battery and a HEADPHONE JACK! Stupid trend. It just show 1+ inferiority .
Naaim Nasri	Now this is a phone i wanna buy.
Ruman Khan	Your T-shirt üëåüëåüëå
MrPlunt	Its gonna be my next phone if I get it for christmas :D
Jack Yarrow	So it‚Äôs pretty similar to every other android phone released this year, but for nearly half the price! Not bad
Hobo Bobo	Would have gotten if it had a headphone jack
Top 10	*NICE VIDEO* *JUST CHECK ME OUT*
TrajchoDovezenski	Apple be like:  Same design, new price!
Jacob Penner	I've always been interested in Oneplus phones but unfortunately we can't get them on contract through our carriers here in Canada, where we are used to buying phones for next to nothing on 2 year contracts. That means soon I'll be able to get the Mate 20 Pro for $0 on contract (because Huawei phones don't sell well here), but would have to pay $719 CAD plus tax (over $800 CAD) to get the 6T... Reason why almost no one buys a Oneplus in North America
Shiro Jm	WHY this awful obsession with dongles , making a headphone with a usb-c conector would be way better.
SXsoft99	I am sooooo annoyed by a light...
Brycen Williams	Kamikaze? Really?
Adjective_K	but why did they have to remove the fingerprint sensor on the back?
Dan Mahr	Does this phone work on Verizon?
Ïã†ÎèôÌôò	I want that wallpaper!!!!!!
Rasmus LDS	Yes going to a pop Up on friday to that shit
Doctor Memey	Thanks MKBHD for the review! I love your content üòÉ
Resale Value	Thank god they removed the fingerprint scanner from the back, it made the phone look ugly in my opinion
G christodoulou	Is there any update on the speakers now the jack is gone? It should go stereo now
Drissi Mohamed	I think that the worst way to transmit audio is through 3.5 mm jack try it in ur car or ur home cinema, u will understand how much quality u r losing because of that analog signal.  So stop crying over it....
psedog	No headphone jack is stupid. Stop following Apple! This is one of the main reasons I left the iPhone!
Ajin Anilkumar	The wallpaper...üòä
Stephen Bannister	Oneplus designed phones that people were impressed with.They have a loyal fans which oneplus said that 80 percent of their customers used their headphone jack and we're here for are customers and what the customer wants they will do. This why there's uproar. I do believe from the response on YouTube in the few hours will see a return of this jack  because oneplus has many fans I believe they although said wireless headphones were good but below 200 dollars was very limited compared to good quality wire headphones with a lot of people actually own a really good pair that cover the entire ear and have  excellent sound quality at fraction of the cost of wireless to match. there is also quite a few people using 3.5 to a source there music there's are few phone company's keeping this because they listen.i think company that is listening to consumers is great thing and believe you may see a return on the oneplus 7.
Chosen_1 Montellano	best phone brand 1 huawei 2 one plus 3 Samsung 4 xiaomi
Xander Tillou	annoiying
1serg 7	Will there be One Plus 6t RED later this year?
Dan Swain	I ordered a Pixel 3, now I'm regretting it. This just looks so nice.
Kennenth Centeno	Love your videos
pepe	Do you need to press the power button before using the fingerprint scanner?
Don Mackay	*C R I S P Y*
Shy Sherelle	Everyone add me on Venmo @sweetcakes35 for a treat
Eduardo Salas Brillembourg	Does it make much a difference between 6 GB and 8 GB?
Nikolas Manuelides	Not the same starting price (but close). Starting price of the 6 is $529 vs $549 for the 6T. It is the same for the middle model (8gb 128gb)
Khubrooh Hussain	The status bar looks rushed. The icons seem wayyy too close to the bezels
Haydi Rodriguez	I like the small notch it‚Äôs more subtle
Haris Jahangir	I love how your videos Resolution and scaling is perfect for my one plus 6 as it is right next to the notch but utilises the whole screen...
Simone De Pascalis	Hope that optic fingerprint sensor does not cause burn-in in that area long-term
pradeeep	Poco fan
Jor	Why do so many people cry about the headphone jack like cmon we‚Äôre almost in 2019
Raystar89 Magic	Pretty disappointed with the OnePlus 6T - I previously owned a OnePlus 3T and to be honest this feels the same.  I think OnePlus should focus on making one model and drop the ‚ÄòT‚Äô model.  One issue with 3T is the brightness in the ray of the sun. They need to improve this aspect of there devices.
Emma Farrer	I thought this guy was Swoozie üòÇ
TheAndrew0085	Yay for ad disclosure \o/
americanv8ss	Still not good enough.
Ventrovial	I currently have the Note 8 and love it, but next year or so when it's starting to grow old, I don't really want to blow another $1000 for the Note 10. So OnePlus has basically bought me over with their sub $550 prices and it's just a matter of time before I finally buy one. (Yes, Apple is completely out of the question)
Brian Felshaw	MKBHD always with the fire tracks üî•
Ash Kay	Its good
Devonta Chase	Review the Honor 8x
NGG30	yeah, it's my next phone...
Cellica Wolf	Another great tech vid
Henry Hill	Can we just pause the whole "bezel-less" thing and actually think about the functionality of a phone? Watching video, yes bezel-less is amazing, but just walking around grabbing your phone, it's not practical.  I bought the BlackBerry Key 2 and it's simply amazing how an older style phone is still so much more practical. It also doesn't turn the screen on when it's in my pocket like my old HTC 10 used to do.
Omexyn‚Ñ¢	I want this phoneü§§ (I have the 3T now)
Big Shaq	Go back to 16:9 please. Like if you agree
muiv	Wallpaper link? :D Can you please always link them (:
Jose Jimenez	Screen and camera. That's the only thing you talk about. And you have a channel and call yourself "specialist". Still waiting for a real review for a telephone, any telephone.
Nicky	One plus is so underrated
Logan Martin	Can you link me the background you use on you're phones?
Good Boy Points	gaybo
Gannon Zimmerman	Joe Rogan Sent me
Orchamy	Trending!
XReflection	Yup, goingt o replace my 3T with the 6T for sure. Can't wait to place my order on Thursday
Peter Dinoy	right now, the phones that are worth buying if you really need an upgrade are the mate 20 pro and the v40. but id rather have the v40 since it has a headphone jack
Flamemanjr	One plus 6 and 6 on trending?
Danny Valdes	wish wish wish wish I could get this with google fi!
Steven Williamson	1st comment: talks about notches. Can we turn off YouTube comments now please.
Federico Funaro	I dont hate notches, but I hate notch + chin   What about that?  The point of the is to have a bezel less design and then BOOM a chin right there just for you its really small but its there
Spreedom	I was sold until the headphone jack. i use headphones on my phone like 3-6 hours a day. im not gonna use a bluetooth headphone where i always have to worry about charging it. i also dont wanna limit myself to an accessory where i can only listen or charge at once.
Arthur Johns	Headphone jack and slow (yet cool) fingerprint unlocking...
_Ridge _	Love the 18:9 aspect ratioüëå
R.K. I	OP6T Best phone of the year!
Khaffit	I am happy I pulled the trigger on the F1 after my old phone finally broke  the notch is way worse, sure but the fingerprint reader is faster and not blinding at night it has 300mAh more The  lower curve of the screen is Just as bad  and most Importantly  a jack  I am content :D
szeriman13	i need a small phone not a brick.

raZor	Wallpaper link?)))
calangel	"Is this your next phone?" Yes sir, yes it is. The 3T needs a replacement.
K√•re Falk	On screen fingerprint sensor is the dumbest "invention" since the notch. You add another step to unlocking the phone, you have to turn it on and then unlock it. I enjoy being able to unlock my phone instantly the moment I pick it up.
Mike Ramage	I don't mind getting rid of the headphone jack, my only issue is that the replacement goes through the charging port (other than bluetooth). But not because I can't charge my phone and listen to music, honestly never done that really as, if i'm at home it'll be from my computer and if i'm out... i'm obviously not charging it. The issue is that I always have a problem with my charge ports no matter how much I try to keep them clean, after about a year they always start to fail, for example I've had my usb type C one plus 3t for two years and after a year it lost the ability to fast charge as the connections have failed and now i have to leave it in a very specific spot for it to charge at all... If i'm out and about using the charge port a lot for headphone.. surely it's going to fail way quicker! anybody with any tips to keeping a charge port working for longer than a year i'd love to hear it!
Jack Staten	They may be taking a que from Apple. The dongle is the best selling accessory for Apple last year according to a few YouTubers.
Jerome Ley	Pocophone isnt battery champ?
Climbers Of Ice	That fingerprint brightness thing has me really turned off.
Donovan Fausette	Soon it's gonna be Apple vs OnePlus
Meh Andi	When are coming to India?
szenasi norbert	I love my OP6, and yes my next phone is for sure OP6T
Preetham Eranki	Great video as always. I would have pounced on this phone if only, it had wireless charging. The only feature which is holding me back from this excellent $550 purchase
chris addy	This is almost  the same everything with regular oneplus 6.  couldn't they have done this first straight from the beginning  with the oneplus 6, kept the headphone jack and  introduced some different colors or special edition for this time?
Aneesh Sankruth	Annoyed by the tiny light that shines on your finger and bleeds through around it? What's your game plan for after the phone unlocks and the screen turns on?
Mike McCurry	What wallpaper is that?
Corey Richmond	How durable are the skins from dbrands? I just went larger from iPhone X to XS Max and I‚Äôm thinking about jumping over to a skin to avoid some bulkiness from cases.
Richard Beauchamp	I love the company. but no headphone socket means no buy.
Coldplan	*how pervy it is* ü§£
G Nunchuk	Is it worth getting the 6T, or wait for the 7?
Mark	But, what about the Vivo Nex S? It has a 4000mAh battery, a in-screen fingerprint scanner, a motorized camera, AND a headphone jack!
NoahOfficial	Is it waterproof
young geezy	Notch kills it for me
Ben Lee	1:10 I see you in da mirror
Enzio von Diest	RIP headphone jack (1878-2018). Thoughts and prayers.
Prince Jassal	Sir, you need to do a video on xiaomi mi mix 3
mohammed abdullah	waiting for iphone XrüëÄ
zeikgold	This absolutely would have been my next phone if they didn't drop the headphone jack. I own a pair of wireless jaybird 2s but I'll still never by a phone when without a headphone jack considering Im listening to something pretty much any time I'm awake. I'm voting with my money here. Same reason I switch from Apple, same reason I switched from the Google pixel.
Rashad Scruggs	Ok I‚Äôm glad you asked because I thought that all those companies were just dick riding apple
Victor B	why no 3.5mm jack?
Mateo12485	Why does Marques look like he has war paint around his face in this vid
Dinesh Gowda	Can anyone suggest a better phone for that price??? Not a major upgrade. Nonetheless, the price makes up for it!!!!
Maan Shaer	Great in-depth video as usual. Thank you for the reviews you make, very useful and educational. One more thing I noticed in your video... LUCKY YOU. What is your opinion on the song, the album and Joyner Lucas?
Nicholas Raines	Other than in Snapchat, does anyone actually use their front camera?
Mohd khan	which phone to buy pixel 3 or one plus 6t ...don't worry about money its right in my pocket..
Szabolcs Gergely	The production quality on this video is outstanding. Just got a 4K monitor recently and your content looks absolutely AMAZING on it.
screename9520	My next phone for sure. Can't wait to trade my Pixel 3 XL...
Akshit Goyal	One plus 6t or the galaxy note 9?
Ayoub Zamouchi	that brick wall .. it looks wired with those two tv‚Äôs attached to it , it would be nice if it was a plain brick perfectly aligned.
Ruben Caris	Already excited for the OnePlus 7 :P
The Bi Guy	Love watching mkbhd videos on the Xs max, super immersive with the new 2:1 aspect ratio
Daniel Trejo	This aspect ratio makes me want to see YouTube in my iPhone XS instead of using my tv as I usually do.. not sure is a good thing but this screen is awesome üòé
J. Sanchez	I hate when people try to defend the removal of the headphone jack  especially on flagship devices, like if I'm paying a significant amount of money to a device that I use daily i would want it to be as convenient as possible, that's why I'm glad samsung still keeps the headphone jack and sd card, many dont need it's better to have it and not need it then need it and not have it at
sTOPzTARING Gaming	It's not there yet I'll wait for sometime more
Okidoki23	Won't the fingerprint scan icon/animation burn into the screen since it's an OLED screen?
Mukhtar Agha	Do u will use over the pixel3?
Eno Beano	ùô∏ùöú it water resistant?
Eric Jeon	I'd still buy the OnePlus 6 over the 6t because i'd much rather prefer having a faster physical fingerprint sensor than the new technology of a on-screen fingerprint sensor. I think it's too much sacrifice for a smaller notch and the headphone jack, but the price is pretty fire.
Sina Olaei	So which phone is your daily driver now? Oneplus 6T or Pixel 3 XL?
Kamran Paracha	The no aux jack just kills it for me
jaydb313	Great üî•
C Carr	OnePlus FTW!
TopGunAce23	Can I know where did you get that wallpaper?? When OnePlus puts the SD Memory Slot on the device, ill buy it.....
Timothee_xskt _	For me no headphone jack is a straight deal breaker, I rock my wired earbuds every single day..
Rutvij DaBro	Why is he saying annoying like that? He doesn't sound American right now. He never sounded like this.
Ben Swanson	"Our sponsor, D-Brand"  Not that this is a big deal, but hasn't MKBHD never had a sponsor? I thought he like specifically made that claim not too long ago. Is this a recent thing?

tsalapbeew	Have Zack do a teardown of this phone to check if the reasoning behind the removal of the headphone jack is true lol!
stiefdb	If 6T had the Pixel camera and software for 100 more bucks it would almost be a no-brainer. About the inscreen fingerprint reader, to be honest, it's not really my thing. I love the fact that (on my 5T) I can open my notifications drawer by sliding up and down the back fingerprint reader. Since I tend to use my phone a lot for reading in bed, the full brightness kicking in for the fingerprint is kind of a bad thing. Nice look to the phone, glass really not needed imo.
Adhe Haryanto	The notch is cool, because its smaller notch than the other phone
Rick van Voorthuijsen	Great video

Jon Morby	I was about to order one when I heard you say "no wireless charging" :( ... that's a dealbreaker for me sadly .... Fingerprint/TouchID sensor is a bit plus but the lack of Qi charging is a pain ... great price though ... I wish Apple would follow suit! (and @apple would put TouchID back on the iPhone ... FaceID just doesn't work for me 80% of the time due to the position of the phone/etc)
pedoncule36	Does it have video output feature via Hdmi or Mhl adapter ? Thanks in advance
Iulian Iancu	What widget u use for calendar appointmemts ???
J A	I've looking hard for a great phone under $600. I've looked at last years flagships and the galaxy s9, even the cheaper chinese flagships of 2018, but this phone won me over. It's definitely going to be my next phone, I love stock android and how smooth it runs.

LA Bjorn	It is about time U.S. consumers get a chance to save money! üëç Verizon & the other big carriers have kind of forced us to buy Apple & Samsung because there hasn't been many other choices. If OnePlus is made available it will give these other companies some real competition.
Gast√≥n Haro	The best notch of any phone right now. They nailed it!
Mladen Mijic	What about OnePlus 5 software, and night mode
Joshua Henry	Good job 1+ but not for me..

matskutti	did mkbhd upload this video in 18:9 ratio?
THE NEON TETRA PRO GAMER	Would not buy this phone just because they removed the headphone jack. In fact I will never buy a phone without one, i don't want the incovinece of finding where i left my adapter to listen to music.
Jonas W.	Does the Fingerprint-Scaner work, when u have a Screenprotecter?
W H	This phone is what the Pixel 3 shoulda been, including the price.

Ricardo Rivera	Tell me between the Pixel XL 3 and the One Plus 6t who is the best?!
zsolti256	No wireless charging, okay, next year maybe :(
Philosophy Mean	It's so stupid that people rage out about the headphone jack. Most people are broke asses like me and can't even afford $300 headphones that would utilize needing the headphone jack in the first place. So many users just have bluetooth speakers/headphones these days. I think I may have only seen like 4 people in the history of modern smartphones that plug their headphones in via a cord.
Baha'adeen Al-ees	Damn they're good
Kevin Segura	üò±love the shirt
Prapul A	Proud to be a samsung user
Mr.E	I dont understand why companies are getting rid of the headphone jack without offering a better option like wireless headphones in the box. I mean eventually phones will be completely wireless and they wont need the charging cable (kinda like the smartwatches nowadays) but it's only after they make wireless the better option. Right now, headphone Jack's are still the way to go
thormaster06	I'm very tempted, but I'll wait for OnePlus 7! Hoping the notch will be gone and wireless charging included!
Ethan Logan	Is that a new oxygen is it looks clean
√Älex Rib√© Bachiller	I love it, but i have the 5t so i'll wait for now  untill the 7 or 7t at least.

Oyamada13	As new tech is added, the old tech have to be sacrificed.  RIP headphone jack.  All hail in-screen fingerprint sensor!  F for respect.
Thompter S. Hunson	Still not a fan of the notches, but this tear-drop one looks much, much better than those ugly ones every manufacturer is dropping these days. I wish Google would do the same. Which is, changing the design only a couple of months after the release. The notch on Pixel 3 is one of the ugliest in the technology's history. Even back in the 1900's they'd tell you is an ugly ass notch.

Azad Singh	Someone please help... OnePlus 6T or the Google Pixel 2xl? They're both the same price. I take lots of photos and videos for social media so I'm leaning towards the google. Although I've been a huge oneplus fan ever since the 1.
George Massalas	Ordered TODAY :-)
Just Gusta_Cz	The OnePlus 6T's teardrop notch implementation is the best I've ever seen and I just want that phone.  We can already predict how 2019 phones will look like, 2018 was a year of lot relatively big notches, now that we are approaching new year, we are getting smaller and smaller notches...  So obviously Samsung Galaxy S10 will be the one phone that will completely get rid of the notch, but what will be after that?  Technology never ceases to amaze me.
AmazingCorn21	No notification light... Why is no one talking about this??
abhi shek	HELLO SIR I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WEATHER ONE PLUS 6T SUPPORT 5G NETWORK OR NOT ? PLEASE REPLY.

tj goodman	people don't believe oneplus they bullshit excuse that theirs no SPACE is a STRAIGHT LIE. LOOK AT THE OPPO R17 based on the 6t and has a big battery and a headphone jack with an on display fingerprint scanner. oneplus is full of shit so people will buy their bt headphones.  smh oneplus

Ta Grand-mere	I am hisitating on the standard oneplus 6 and now the 6T.. waht are your recommendations, I am regularly using wired headphones and the rid of the 3.5 mm headphone jack screws me but the fact that the battery is improoved thats really great.. I don't know the 6 is about to get half the price and the 6t is going to be the best seller...
Ivan Sitohang	it's weird that OP got rid of the 3.5mm jack when they have huge followers that really really value the headphone jack. still a big progress from them in the competitive market, it's just a bummer they took it away.

Darcer's Tech	So far happy with my 6. Really looking forward to what OnePlus does with the 7. Would want just 2 things: stereo speakers and slightly higher-resolution display.
Maaz Shaikh	Wallpaper link?
roco z	you definitely need another car, no tesla.

SuperRay105	This shit is beautiful
TheRealMikeShea	So you're telling me, a phone with a 6.4" display, which is massive by the way, has no room for a headphone jack because a measly 3700mah battery and the fingerprint scanner are taking up too much room? I would like to suggest bullshit on that. Maybe make the phone thicker? What's the benefit of a paper thin phone anyway?
G.D.	no stereo speakers is a bummer to be honest
Hatori Hanzo	As an iPhone Xs user, this is all I‚Äôve ever wanted in a phone. No notch, in display fingerprint scanner, low price. Unhappy about the no headphone jack but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me.

LordThomske	Is this your next phone... Actually yes... I'm still "stuck" with the OnePlus 3T and it's time for a new one :D screen is coming of my 3T, I want the dual camera setup, and I love the in-display fingerprint reader xD the "Drop" notch looks actually good too, I'm hyped :)

HRIDOY NUR	I think under skin touch sensor not so bad .. but back sensor is more fun to use. Coz the index finger not only unloks the screen but also swipe down notification panel and changing photos. Most of all its lightings fast. Under skin sensor will be difficult to use when you ar laying on bed. I have faced it. There is onther thing, for front touch id sensor we are losing headphone jack.   After all of this i prefer back finger print sensor. üòãüòã
Serchan Look	No zoom lens eventhough two lenses at the back. Sorry Oneplus, bye bye
NabilRider555	God I hate waterdrop notch. I know that this phone is manufactured by Oppo but why can't it be a Halo Notch. Dang it.
CScuber	Sorry I‚Äôm ditching iPhone. Been a fan for 6 years since my first iPhone 4 but can‚Äôt justify spending 1,500 on a new iPhone Xs Max (yes if I was to get it I‚Äôd max out because I‚Äôm already spending so much) trading in my iPhone and joining the android bus. I‚Äôm excited üôÇ

Kenny	Not upgrading without headphone jack. One plus 6 squad where you at?
Gabrijel ≈†venda	I have a question about the headphone jack...  Why don't all headphone companies replace the standard end of headphones, with a usb type-c ending?
David Sage	The one plus 6t is back to basics  Reminiscence of the OG essential phone ‚úî‚úî
Harvey Solomon	Does it work on Sprint if its unlocked or does it matter?
ewizzle1978	price is really nice.  Sweet spot I think.  No wireless charging and no stereo speakers are a bigger bummer for me than I think for most.  looks badass tho.  Intrigued by the UI tweaks.  With the pixel 3 being not very impressive an upgrade, I was kicking around the 6T to replace by P2XL, but the camera is clearly a full step below.  Hope somebody does a really thorough side by side of the software differences from stock android.  Maybe One Plus should do a higher end flagship too.  One Plus 7 Ultra or something.  Include the shortcuts they are making to shave the price.  Wireless charging, better speakers, upgraded camera, IP rating etc...

Jaime Duncan	Great video, nice phone. Can it be unlocked  by a simple picture ? One of the frustrating things about trying to buy an Android phone (in this case recommending one to a friend) is that only Apple gets really tested for security. It could be the fact that android users are not into privacy, so maybe they don‚Äôt care, but for me is important to know this stuff before recommending a phone.

Max Chenchar	I honestly like the fingerprint on the back
Mark McCoskey	IF T-Mobile will actually give me $300 for my Nexus 6, then, YES, this will be my next phone.
Jesper Herrmans	Im so sad that i very recently bought a OnePlus 6 since i couldnt wait for the 6T
yogin tickoo	3:36 so you have to press the side button each time to unlock it!! that kinda sucks!!
diablo X9	Soooo dammend impressed with oneplus!!! Might consider to get oneüòé
gulu Gu	Still clitoris screen
Niall T	Hate the front finger print.  The back finger print is great.  Easy to use.  Doesn't blind you are night with bright light.   I'll stick with my one plus 6
Atintegulsno	Honestly prefer my 6 over this, glad I didn't wait for this.
Kio Truong	Yup...6t is my next phone
224wwefan	You kept saying last year but the 6 was released this year.
BLU	put that fucking fingerprint sensor on the back and leave the jack there :((((((((
Yowie91	Im gonna said it... this phone but in the 5,5 inch version would be awesome. But 6,4? geez...
naruto sasuke	5:16, I stopped watching
Pizzaboiii	Where did u get this wallpaper from? :)
Russell Crook	Still no Mate 20 Pro review. When's it coming?
Yeh	this is the same design as oppo r17
NIL66	No wireless charge, sooooo....¬†I'll still going with the 5T :)
todroyas	ngl as an iPhone user this has me tempted to switch ahhh
Alexander Tipugin	2:1 footage is sooo good
harrisric128	Yup
Alan Fernandez	I wanna see some drop test and water tesistance test. Just like apple and samsung.
I'm Jonny	The gestures... nope. Samsung will have the best implementation multi tasking wise no doubt.

Rowh X Jerr√∏	Look at all those babies copying apple by removing the headphone jack. Wonder where all the jack lovers will hate on now!
Karam Eid	I have no idea how the notch/lack of a headphone jack are still even  possibilities for people... It's like you're paying full price the least you could do is get a full phon... Here's to hoping Samsung delivers on their promises
Jamil Maqdis Anton	Weather app?
G.Punkt.ART	Hmm, just bought an oneplus 6 :D
Evan Pilkington	"If you remember the Essential Phone"   Why you got to do us like that üò¢
Dango pop	it's not my next purchase, seems oneplus is following apple's example.. gross
Mak Kunsman	Damn Marcus you are so professional nowadays!! Lovin it
balu kiran	We have to tap the lock button before on-screen finger print??
–Ü–≤–∞–Ω –ü–∏–ª–∏–ø–∫–æ	Cool. A nice thing to hear about the price
Sam Friedman	Wait, hold on, I don't understand this at all. You claim that one of OnePlus 6T best features is its "same exact price as the last one," but it's clearly more expensive. The OP 6 is $529, the 6T is $549. That seems like a very big (and obvious) oversight.
Vmt16	7:18 Holy shit, you went to a Devils game?! NICE!
simmz4	Nice phone but I'll stick with my OnePlus 6 Avengers edition until they bring out the OnePlus 7 üòéüëåüèæ

Bruce Kizer	Would the fingerprint sensor work with a glass screen protector?
David Jeffries	what are the biggest differences between this and the s9/ note9??? besides the wireless charging
George Kajaia	Great review as always ! Thanks a lot. About headphone jack, oneplus is joking when telling that they've removed it because of battery and onscreen fingerprint, c'mon Note 9 has stylus and 4000 battery in it! And still rocks headphone jack! Way you go Samsung. Hope they will not remove the jack any time soon.
Mohammed Jishi	I currently have the oneplus 3t, should i upgrade to this one?
MadJack	I only clicked on because I saw some Firewatch art on the home screen. Where my Firewatchers at?
Rittu Sil	Is there any white in colour?
prohanganapathy	Meh! Glad I don't have to cancel my Mate20 Pro pre-booking! :)
Philipp Schuster	I love this notch! beautiful
David West	The only reason I haven't moved to one plus is because I am too used to the samsung edge/Infinity screen
Sun and clouds	I'm probably insane, but I don't care the smallest about üéß jack. I'm easily taking the bigger battery and the in screen fingerprint sensor.
Hannes Alm	Finally an honest review. Not some sponsored shit
Henry Cervantezzz	I'm sold! Goodbye Samsung s9
Zach Carmichael	What's with the lock screen when he's unlocking/locking? It's showing another skin and then switches to the OnePlus lock screen. Very odd...
Darryl Barnes	No stereo speakers?
JAYSTAR	Looks good just wish there was a smaller version for those who don‚Äôt want a big screen
Cory Wilson	Better than apple
Alex Areeda	Could I use this phone with straight talk?
DeX	Wow that headphone jack removal really killed it for me.
Brainfly	Noticed you were listening to Lucky You. Good choice üëå
Frederik	It seems to unlock faster then my iphone 6 plus..
Paulo Alexandre	OnePlus 6 3300mAh battery was not that bad. I'd easily sacrifice the extra battery if I can bring that headphone jack back, especially if it keeps the dash charge. But the fingerprint reader tho...
Vic Manuel	Did you change the aspect ratio on your videos because it‚Äôs way better for my iPhone XS max ?
Azil CoC	That skin is ugly

Kairo Ent Music	From an Apple fan, this looks like the only Android phone I‚Äôd buy.
Wills Rockson	Nice Video @Mkbhd
Nazmul Islam	I Don't like front fingerprint & removing headphone jack, they should learn from Samsung & LG with Water prof with headphone jack & large bettrey
Jeremiah Sgro little bit of everything	One plus 5 8gb ram 128gb storage I use and love it.
Alejandro Baldetti	The wallpaper.......
Devansh Royal	I'm better off with my notch less note 9 with a headphone jack
jeffx40	Looks like a great phone accept for a couple things.  No headphone jack plus an even thinner profile (now at 19.5:9) equals no thank you.  Glad I grabbed a regular oneplus 6, if the headphone jacks gone for good, so am I.
ThatBoi_ Danni	The 2 LEGENDARY companies left   *SAMSUNG AND LG*
Anthony Gavriel	Do you have to press the power button out of standby before the under screen finger print reader works?
Kyle Meier	you and casey should do an episode of autofocus on the model x
Sketchbook_Paradise	This phone looks incredibly cool, much admit the lack of a jack is breaking me... if anyone wants to know how great one plus are, ive been using a oneplus 2 since feb 2016 and its still going strong! It's the first phone I've had that I will be sad to see go when the time inevitably comes

Ali Soleymani	‚Å¶‚òπÔ∏è‚Å©
Israel Soto	Why the notch just give me a thin black bar.
jk jk	This phone has an amazing value but I think the OnePlus 6 has the better value just for that headphone jack and back fingerprint.  I use the headphone jack everyday and it's too big of a trade-off for me.  Also, that in display fingerprint reader was a gamble and hurts the experience of the phone.  Remember, OnePlus has always been known for performance and speed; having a slow fingerprint chops a big chunk of the experience of the phone.  That huge battery is an amazing improvement and is worth it
Abel Garcia	Pixel 3 (No XL) or OnePlus 6T?
ndongmo joseph	My question to you is: what do you do with this phones after you review ? üòÇ you could send them to some us dudes who got downgrades... Will be delightedüòÅ
Anurag Manjhi	Mi Mix 3 is much much sexier than this boring upgrade..... lets go XIAOMI
Mike E	Until they can improve the camera quality up to Google's level I won't be buying one. I think they have a win in almost every category, except the camera Department.
Isak s	My problem with this phone is that it doesn't have a headphone jack, I bought the galaxy s9 cause there was pretty much nothing else interesting that both had and oled and a headphone jack.  But the fingerprint reader under the screen is nothing more than a gimmick, I don't like having the fingerprint reader on the front cause it just doesn't feel as smooth when unlocking as having it on the back in my opinion.
Red Fire Wolf üê∫üî•	I saw Kamikaze üòä

Cameron Bell	dbrand is shit
Asa Snow	Do a video. LG v40 vs OnePlus 6t
Christian Rosa	This guy went from reviewing phones to being obsessed with fingerprint readers, face recognition, and notches....these are the kind of bullshit stuff noboyd cares about!!!! I hate that he has an influence on the phone market. Always talking about "premium feel" like wtf...this guy does not represent the market who just want  good battery, nice screen and no notch, we don't care about the other bullshit
silverisss	Last year OP said there wont be a 6T hmmm
Ahmet	notches are old news, xiaomi released the mi mix 3 so everything else is unacceptable to me at this point. I welcome the 2019 notchless/bezelless/slider phones that we'll be getting
Alex Tech	I will wait until the phones are notchless! Then it‚Äôs worth it
HackSparrow	I assume it still has a decent dac in it ?
George Nieves	Peep kamikaze by em  good shit
Bastiaan van Stokkom	Can I get a link to that wallpaper pls. It looks amazing. Getting the 6T as soon as it comes out in europe!!!

Jared Thompson	I want that phone, only problem is my OnePlus 3 is so good it just won't die haha!
Dipanshu Mishra	Anyone please provide the wallpaper link
MCooper247	Soon as it is compatible with my service i can go for it
FinalSpider00	Yes definitely my next phone, my S8+ isn't doing too good.
Jose Carrasquillo	I wonder why they cant put a headphone jack on the top instead of the bottom....
Kevin Kurz	Yes
GamerX705	Honestly, If that ran IOS and had wireless charging, it would be my dream phone.
Auro Dash	It is a bigger notch than one plus's brother company realme- realme 2 pro
AMIT KUMAR	OnePlus has made a name for itself for producing highly polished, fast and smooth high-spec smartphones at around half the price of top-end rivals.
Tom Ford	Do you have to press the power button and turn on the screen to use the sensor?
Mishael Suko	iPhone XR would be my next phone. Better performance and wireless charging üòè
Rustam Razzaq	This is definitely going to be my next phone! Conveniently just switched to T Mobile as well!
pdahandyman	It's not just you, Marques, but I'm really tired of one of the primary performance points of any phone is how fast the fingerprint sensor is. I really don't care if it takes 0.02 seconds versus 0.04 seconds. I don't mean to bag, it's just frustrating :D Though my OnePlus 2 still works perfectly, battery life is starting to fade. Maybe I will upgrade.
mrpickem	Does it work on Verizon?
ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿ±ŸàŸÜŸä ŸÜÿ™	Pixel 3 XL left the conversation
LuiDeSantoro	OnePlus 6t removed the headphone jack because there is no space in the phone anymore because of the bigger battery and in display fingerprint sensor. Watch mrwhosetheboss video
bannajirocks	Tear drop notch is still disappointing.. hope s10 goes totally notchless !!
PurpleRupees	Inconvenient biometrics in the dark and no wireless charging are the only things holding me back on this.
Lethal Stinger	Finally!! The corners are rounded at the top of the phone when you hide the notch!!!
Ikpegbu Tochukwu	Don't know why people like this indisplay fingerprint scanner, it's a horrible implementation, imagine when the screen damages, you won't be able to unlock your phone if the fingerprint was the only way you used to have access to your phone, you gonna have to replace the screen which will cost way more than the ordinary normal screen. Leaving out the headphone jack was a stupid thing, I rather have a phone that lags that has a headphone jack than get one of those crappy bluetooth headphones that sounds awful
JavisGonzalezVlogs	WTEFF NO HEADPHONE JACK!!!!!
Tarek Ziad	What about sound is it good??
Thabo Matsinye	Yeap 2:1 ratio video is Dope. Now I understand.
Bat Man	S10 is going to kick a lot of *Ass* voohooo
Nedialko Nedialkov	Yes man, this is my next phone! I was pretty sure about that even before the launch but now that I know that they kept the price (even throw additional 64gig).... I'M SOLD!
David Zavala	I dont know yet, the lack of an sd, wireless charging, stereo speakers  is a lot down when I can get an s9 for about the same. I'm still holding to my s7, and so far the only phone that has it all is the note 9, but it's expensive and big. I'm a small phone guy.
Lloyd Pliskin	The intro volume is louder than usual
P.V.N SRINATH	I have a small doubt if phone is lock and screen off then if we want to unlock phone then we can directly keep fingerprint on the screen  or we have to wakeup screen and then keep????
William Amundson	Marques, I can live without the notch or the fingerprint scanner, the battery would be the only the upgrade I would be looking for. Do you think that once the 6T goes on sale, will they lower the price of the regular 6? And if so, would you consider the 6 upgrades to be worth the premium price?
Tome Cile	that dbrand skin is slippery as fu..., just saying. I had to remove it from iphone x after 10 minutes
ahmed hisham	How about that casey nistat merch
Mike Mena	Is it micro SD card expansion cable or it's just a storage on the phone only?
Eddie Weedon	I really want this phone, especially now I find out it isn't much more expensive than the 6 but I can't get it because I laughed at my girlfriend when she got the iPhone 7 and has to carry that rubbish adaptor for her headphones üò≠üò≠
Osama Hafad	Where can i get those wallpapers?
Walid El Assili	Definitely my next phone! I have the 5t now. Can't wait for Nov 6 to buy it!! 256GB Storage and In Display fingerprint scanner?! Yes please!!
Ahmed Faisal	Just got 6. keeping the headphone jack and real fingerprint sensor for next couple of years.
M Fin	No headphone port? Ok, I think we are done here (and I had much faith in 1+).

Andrew Hynes	That camera strategy tho at 1:12
Tore233	really nice phone, but I will wait for the Galaxy 10 with headphone jack <3
Ashvini Divekar	this is a real phone
Marc-Andr√© B	I can't help but cringe everytime he says "techtober"
Saim Ashrafi	Doesn't the phone unlocks directly from sleep with fingerprint? Everytime you had to press the power button, turn the display on and then press your finger. That's annoying to me. I want to place my finger on the sensor and it should unlock.
Malifestro	As an Essential Owner... that notch is almost the same.  I'd move over.  I don't like the heavy handed approach to device customization like Samsung does.  So the closer to stock, maybe with some good tweaks the better.
Azmol Hossain	I still like oneplus 6 more! The on-display-fingerprint-sensor is not a big deal. What's the difference, it's just a fingerprint sensor after all!
Siddhartha Mukherjee	Yes it is.....üòã

Iroquois Pliskin	No headphone jack. No buy. You failed OnePlus.
guirufo013	I would have ordered 1 straight away but finger print reader is in the wrong place for me....love where it is on the 5t... At the back
Rythulian	The fact that the Galaxy Note9 exists invalidates any "lack of space" excuse for removing the headphone jack.  Samsung shoved a freaking stylus in their phone while having a huge 4000mah battery. The area taken by the Spen could fit a few headphone jacks.
Theodis Ivy	Note 9 is better
Juan1322	You are all gonna kill me, but I love the shape of that notch, I mean, I'd rather not have it. But if I had to have one I think is the prettiest out there
Dmitry Nazarenko	Anyone know what wallpaper he's using?

princemon888	What are the widgets you used with your 6T?
Leo Garcia	kamikazee album.
Taikamuna	It would be cool if there were phones with no front camera. Because there are definitely people out there who never use the front camera (like me). It would solve the notch issue and look really nice.
Iulian Apostol	does this phone has a night mode option straight from the software menu ?
AKSHAY RAJVIR	I game a lot and i use headphnes, 3.5mm is a huge loss since bluetooth headphones are nowhere near 3.5mm in terms of quality.
o3tomas	I cannot believe how badly google f'ed up with their pixels. Such a shame.
Andrew Kearns	Verizon compatibility?! I'm finally switching to OnePlus after being a loyal Galaxy user for 6 years.
Vladimir Massillon	If you have t mobile you can get this phone half off with a trade in on any previous one plus. That's an awesome deal
forestman111	It might not be as fast as a normal reader but is it more accurate? My Pixel 1's reader probably fails more than it doesn't so accuracy is way more important.
Lionel Lim	Where are the haters of headphone jack at? Laughing at apple initially? LOL. Just adopt the wireless headphones. Why is it so hard for you guys to adopt?

Angelo Flores	Will there be more colors released?
fifa22 fifa22	@ 4:50 I wish Google would have done that rounded corners in the recent app menu. If yo have a rounded corner display like the 2 xl and 3 xl it makes sense that the recent apps cards will be rounded corners as well. Instead we get a recent apps card with sharp edges. OnePlus did it right.
Gregor Porada	I think you didn't mention about 60 fps videos that comes with one plus 6T, and one plus 6 does not have that. Please let me know if I am wrong.
Brian McCollum	Is it VERIZON WIRELESS compatible?????
Gayas Ansari	Im more of an compact phone guy......will you give me a thumbs up for Google pixel 3?
Mike Durrett	I feel like the minority saying that I don't really care about wireless charging. Sold on this phone. Wish Verizon would actually carry it.
Max Schmidt	Which Launcher is he using?
KLX	Man I wish I could have this phone but I can't afford it, send me a phone Mr. mkbitch144p
Md. Tanbirul Islam	VIVO V11 Pro is almost same but better in design with headphone jack. Oppo, VIVO and OnePlus are from same mother company BKK. If you compare the price with its siblings, OnePlus is much costly.
Shakeh B.	The lack of enthusiasm from mkbhd when it's not a 1500$ phone is just funny. Like this phone is legit innovative with inscreen fingerprint reader, a cleverly engineered screen and speaker design, great software experience, great design and most importantly : REASONABLY PRICED and yet he still manages to present this product in such a tired way that you think it's a competitor to samsung J3 .
Abhi Thakral	Why you bash Android phones more than iOS dude ? Let me know in your videos if you think iOS is better than Android
Rohan Bhatt	Buying new phone's every year is i guess new worthless trend for people for no reason even if the old one's working damn good "A RAT RACE"
KungFuMedia	I've had my Galaxy S7 going on two ish years now, and it's treated me fairly well, but I am really starting to want an upgrade with all of the things I missed on the S7. I got my S7 oblivious to the fact the S8 would come only a month or so later, and I think the 6T would be a seriously solid upgrade without destroying the bank account. My biggest gripe is the absence of an audio jack, but I think I could get past that with a tiny adapter and the fact of the new battery and screen fingerprint sensor.
Varun Daga	Anyone here noticed that Casey Neistat T-shirts.
Yannick Van Wiele	Wallpaper please?
M3lem	Don't know if I will change from the 6 soon, but let me ask you, what is the best screen protector for the one plus 6? Is it the 5-D? Because I used the 5-D screen protector and it collected a lot of dust in front of the front camera and an air line on the left side, also today it randomly cracked a tiny piece that's upper than the ear piece on the notch, so can you recommend a screen protector for me?
Anees Bakrain	Thank you for 18:9 aspect ratio video.
GeoBOY TheHybrid	But I love this paradise phone !üî•
Ricardo Pinto	Would you change it for a s7edge Samsung?
Vaibhav Pandey	So the screen needs to be switched on and then the fingerprint sensor works?
HONDA RULES	If I have a notch, I want it big like on an iPhone X. This essential phone type notch bugs me so much more because it's so minimal and feels like it never had to be there. I preferred the old OnePlus notch

Damian Seals	Been waiting for Verizon compatibility for a while now, that's pretty exciting
Nurlan Abdrassilov	I was 100% sure to upgrade to 6t from 6 until I heard "The headphone jack is now gone"... Skipping 6T now...
Harshdeep singh	Where can i get that wallpaper
Tomahawk93	I see you‚Äôre wearing some Casey Merch
aaae	Using pentile means you have 33% less ppi than whats written on paper. I had OnePlus 3 for one day and returned it. It looked like shit. Samsung at leasts puts QHD so it actually looks good. People making fun of iPhone XR which has more ppi then op6t (326 vs 302 IRL).
Ethan Etchart	lucky you by eminem and joyner
Cornelius	Can you tell if you have notifications while the phone is off like the 1plus 6 with the light on the left of the notch?
stupidgermans	@Marquen Brownlee - Vivo had the funtouch update. The fingerprint is almost instant now, as soon as you put finger it opens up
Jakob Tvete	I‚Äôve been knowing I was going to buy it, i decided like a month ago because I need a new phone and I LOVE OnePlus.
Philipp Schindler	Wallpaper?
Devtech Solutions	who said the face unlock doesn't work really well at night...as per my experience its fast and works like a charm at night
Daniel Paz	Xiaomi did the "bezelless" smartphone better than anybody else. Oh my... but that Oxygen OS. Those gestures are better than Google's.
Austin Bush	Your video ratio is way better to watch on a phone like the iPhone Xr over other 16:9 videos. Definitely more enjoyable to watch!
lovegadgets	Guys this video was probably shooted around a month ago because oneplus also showed marques video in Live event so this shows how good there terms with Marques is
Silviu	To all the people randomly scrolling down the comments I hope you had and have a wonderful day and that things are going wrong they will turn out good and I love your videos because you can tell that appreciate what you get and never take it for granted like other you tubers üíïüíïcan you send me the iPhone xr because my parents don‚Äôt want me having an expensive phone even if I‚Äôve saved up for it üòäüòä
forceofmortality	why not just skip 6 and release 6T instead?
Molly's Lovechild	I'm loving this aspect ratio this is the only video I've seen on YT that almost fills my note 9 screen without having to 'zoom to fill'
Oscar Darias	The wallpaper?
Robert Crawford III Wilson	Why can't apple do a screen fingerprint scanner?
Jakobskjorstad	Stopped at 5:15 buying oneplus 6 instead
Csaba Kovacs	I have the OP 6 ( having only flagship phones this is the best so far ) I love all the new tech inside from the 6T, the only thing I don't like is that it's getting bigger and bigger. I just wish that some day it will be a OP with a 5.8 inch display (same internals) and no bezels, or the same as on the 6T.... I think this will be a good size. But that's just me.
crazythegamer	The year that I upgraded they add compatability with Verizon. Just my luck.
Adrian B	You're going too fast
James Riley	Pixel 3 xl or OP 6T?
Adrenaline Rush	Phone of the year - OnePlus 6T (price to features ratio) Phone of the year - Galaxy Note 9 (all around best)
Carlos Rossetti	The percentage of people that  2:1 format cater to is laughable. You should stick to the tried and tested format that the vast  majority of people are consuming on. Otherwise we are being saddled with awful black bars on account of a tiny minority.
TheDark Knut	Why is nobody talking much about the camera?
TechDove	I was considering the OnePlus 6T, until I discovered it's sans headphone jack.
Vipin Santhosh	nah.
Kamal bishnoi	And here comes the  note 9 with the space of headphone jack memory card slot and a whole spen with curved screen.
Nessie Jr	My main question here that I seriously cannot understand is why the hell doesn't Oneplus lower the price of its previous phones? I checked their website and they are the exact same prices even though they are older models
Butch Jones	Finally on Verizon!!! I called them just to make sure, they confirmed it. So to answer your question, yes that will be my next phone.
smkvida	That's how pixel needed to be with the storage 128gb 6ram  and 256gb 8ram two great choices and that's why I'm going to try the oneplus 6t
demise reece	Glad I bought the vivo NEX S , I'm good until the Samsung Galaxy s10 arrives üòé  No notch 4000mah battery =9/half screen on time easy Headphone jack üòÇ 6.6inch super amoled screen Great dual rear camera setup Decent pop-up selfie camera 8GBRam  Global Rom 128 storage  Hi-fi Dac  In screen fingerprint sensor  Android P next month same internals as one plus 6T Cheaper that the one plus 6T Oh yeah did I mention no NOTCH üòÇ
Eman Prosic	Cries in iPhone 6
Azim Ruzimurodov	Send me one of 6t ))))
Josh Brice	Making the Pixel phones even worse as an option
Sem Hendriks	tbh... that dongle is ugly as f*ck imo
Jakkkob T	Whats touch ID ?
EliteGeeks	I want Google Fi  compatibility
james smalley	Hey Marques, any chance of an update on what you think the best in ear earphones are ATM. The battery in mine is starting to go and will be upgrading before Christmas. Thanks  James
nabigh nilawar	Wallpaper please ..!
Proton	Pickup a used Galaxy s8+ on EBay for $400 and under. I got one for $360, slapped a microsd in it, and I have plenty of storage. Camera is just amazing, the display is gorgeous, great battery life, snappy software, and oh cool, a headphone jack!
Rookie Rishu	The Title of the Video itself explained the video
Abhishek jain	@marques any comment on the privacy issues of Android phones coming from China?
TruthxAR	Removal of rear fingerprint sensor, removal of headphone jack, same exact camera from last year. I guess they compromise now.
Food Gurudev	Never Settle.. Headphone jack removed üòï
Amit Trivedi	I bought a one plus 6 at launch....Now I'm feeling cheated....They should update my OP6 to 6T
Albi Cuka	Where can I find the wallpaper that MKBHD has on the oneplus?
Kevin Hernandez	I was gonna get the iPhone XS max but now I‚Äôm thinking that I should get this smartphone with it‚Äôs great features and software and it‚Äôs half the price of the XS max so I might as well buy the one plus 6T
Google Me	Just returned my iphone xr. I'm getting this beast when it comes to mobile.
Seanhackmania	This is a phone
infamouscoma886	Funny how everyone was shitting one apple for removing the headphone jack and now that android phones are doing it it‚Äôs ok. Yeah fuck you you apple hating assholes. Not you mbkhd you cool.
Tyler Garrett	nice shirt bro
Anas Whatit'slike	SAMSUNG. PLEASE. DON'T DO IT... DO NOT REMOVE HEADPHONE JACK. PLEASE. I BEG YOU! DON'T! - Proud Note9 user.
Bene _2106	I have the OP3T. What do you think I should do. Wait for OP7 or get the OP6T now? My phone is still great just want a upgrade. Cheers
Neal Bagai	But the 6t will like never depreciate
T- ilex	I have an older car (2006). So I still have use for a headphone jack because of charging needs. Looks like the LG v40 is my next phone. üòî
Edgardo Tovar	Oof
Isaac Mintz	Is the AI in the Pixel 3 gonna be worth spending more $$, as opposed to the 6t? Sure, AI is dope, but worth the extra $300??
ENDESGA	Everyone's complaining about the headphone jack. C'mon, do you REALLY use it that often? How about you buy some decent Bluetooth headphones, and they'll last longer than your phone's; because everything is going to go wireless!
El Pablo	OnePlus - New Design, Same Price  Apple - Old Design , 200$ more
PXLMKR	6:06 damn, that shot is lit üî•üòç
Fremy Gonzales	LOL you can tell how slow that in display ... that would be such an annoying way to unlock the phone. If you have the OP6 there's no reason to upgrade when it's basically the same phone. It's only the battery that would make me think twice but then again dash charging is there so that compensate with it.    How is a slower in display scanner an improvement?
Artur Garncarz	So do I have to turn on the display and then use my finger to unblock it?!
Kenneth Hudgins	Galaxy s8+ user here. Coming from a crappy asian nomu s30 that could barely get signal in the USA, and a Lumia 1520 windows phone before that, I think I'm good right now. My s8+ is still great, both in performance and looks. The galaxy s10 concepts look cool, but things have gotten so good now that I'm going to need a bigger reason drop that kind of cash on a phone again. Got my s8+ for $500 practically brand new off of ebay 4 months before the 9 came out.
Aarjav Jain	would u suggest to wait for the oneplus 7 instead of buying the oneplus 6t if u can wait? and around when will it be released?
slickvisualpoetry	Literally all new cars offer wireless charging. I like the idea of chucking my phone into the glove compartment and picking it up recharged is appealing. A qi module wouldn't increase the price too much. That would have been a great incremental update.
Giovanni Di Capua	Great quality video, so minimalistic. Loved it
Andrey Kovachev	not my next phone. when i heard no headphone jack i went and bought note9. I am super satisfied with it.
Fayaz Sadiq	Rip the Jack lol
Omnifas	How does the fingerprint sensor work with apps with fingerprint unlock?  Does it overlay the sensor graphic or something?
Julius Caesar	ITS SPOOPTOBER GOD get it right
Angelina	Nope.. I was hyping so much about this phone :( sucks.  i think i will be bying the Mate 20 PRO och P20
Jmcgee1125	I like this phone, and considering I was looking for something new, this is high on the list. For the price, nothing can beat it.
Cedric Codrington	Google is going to be in trouble because not only are they going to have to directly compete with iOS but also OnePlus hardware.
Locker 44	my honor 10 at night when I wake it up, it turns up it screen's brightness so it shines at my face to help unlocking the phone at low light
Mathias	I gave it some thought and (for now) I am fine with notches. It just sits there at the top and I watch Youtube videos in 16:9. I wouldn't even notice it. And by the time wider aspect ratios become the standard on Youtube we will have sensors and cameras under the screen. Samsung is working on that already, I give it two years tops until we see selfie cams under the display. Also, I get why they removed the Jack. Keeping it means it takes up space. So you either can't put in new hardware features *or* you have to build other parts smaller. Miniaturization costs a LOT in R&D. So you either give Jack the boot and sell your phone with a cheap dongle or you put a lot of resources into R&D for the sole reason of keeping a connector standard that is over 100 years old and customers will complain because suddenly the phone costs 700 bucks. So yeah. It's sad, the 3.5mm jack is very handy (I use bluetooth headphones but some times I forget to charge them) but as long as I get a dongle in the box (I am looking at you, Apple!) and a fingerprint reader in the screen to nerd out over... I can live without Jack.
Rupesh Tashildar	No one on earth would sacrifice a heaphone jack for indisplay finger print scanner
Youssef AK	Is this phone too big
Fejiri Onowakpokpo	My next phone is the iPhone XR you‚Äôre gonna give to me üòä
farizmatic	No Headphone jack solution : include wireless headphone in a package
ibrahem khwaldeh	HUAWEI beats all!
Thx ImFine	I've got a OnePlus 5t and I'd love to buy the 6t but the trade-in program offers so little value. I've kept my phone in a case since day one just for the reason of being able to sell it one day in perfect condition (and get the highest amount of money back), it's so annoying to see that I can't get even close to what i bought this phone for.
heartSLB	I'm impressed!
Suyash Verma	Where can i get that wallpaper üòç
Farooque shafi	One plus is making revolution in Android. I have been using one plus for 3 years. Now upgraded to one plus 6 five months before it's worthy.....
Cowen K. Gittens	This is definitely not my phone. It has a notch...don't really like notches (Which is why I have a Samsung Note 8) and they removed the headphone jack (which is why I have a Samsung Note 8).
Fnatixful	I lov how your videos fits perfect in my galaxy s8 screen

Sanjay Sanju	a solid review for a solid device...  link for the wallpaper.....
Life of Luis	Looks Sweet as hell, but I'm loving my Pixel 3xl.
Mattez P.	No notification-LED??? Please Oneplus, stay with the notification-LED. A customizable notifivcation LED is the most underrated feature.
Fred .Flintstone	Marques Brownlee, whats your daily phone now?
Moon	Google should take some "inspiration" from dat notch
Amer Mostafa	Honor 8x please
angger prabowo	Nice wallpaper as always ü§òüèª
syam kumar.s	Can you review Mi mix 3..?
MrBrannew20	I don't know if i heard the price or not but what is it. I might consider it. But damn. This or the p20 pro,  iPhone xs max. Too many phones out lol. I love my note 9 but i want two phones but it's hard to decide
Youtube Channel	Do you really need 8GBs of Ram in a phone? What are you doing that requires that much ram on your phone. My iPhone 7 Plus has 3GBs of Ram and it‚Äôs never been an issue for me.
BorisZX6R	Since they listen to their customer, please ask them for this piece of information... How many customers said they want a slower fingerprint sensor and a slightly larger battery instead of the headphone jack !? Cause I would much rather have say wireless charging and a headphone jack.
anurag kumar	No headphone jack ..it sucks
Andres Garcia	do you think that with an software update, the fingerprint reader can be fixed so that the brightness wont be so obvious ? because i agree the animation is pretty corny
ÈòøËâØ„ÄÖÊú® Êö¶	16:9 please
Wolf	OnePlus 5 is the best phone I've ever used. But thanks to No Headphone Jack,I won't be getting OnePlus ever again. Removing something is never be considered a one step forward,It is a step backward..Only a marketing strategy to earn more since a usual  good quality wired earphone costs 20$ compared to avg Bluetooth one which costs at least 100$. Fuck You
fahad naif	What I like about one plus. The stock Android and the price. That's it.
Mihai Petrescu	+Marques Brownlee, awesome videos!    Quick question: can you unlock the phone with the in-display fingerprint sensor without first waking up the device?    I noticed in your video that every time you unlocked it with the fingerprint sensor you first pressed the power button. I'm asking because I tend to use my phones using only one hand and that might be a deal breaker for me.    Thank you in advance...peace! :)
Lonely Sudharshan	bro i want to buy a phone say which is best mi mix 3 and oneplus 6t
Arush bhat	The best thing about OnePlus is it's software, it's so buttery smooth and they provide regular updates for 2 years. I want to see how it performs when compared to Note 9, pixel 3.
Brian Evans	This phone looks awesome
100 000 subscribers without a video challenge	Save youtube guys subscribe PewDiePie !
Al Espinosa	Verizon! yes!
Gwede Johnson	Does it work with Verizon now?

Ryan Kelley	Can anyone link me the wallpaper?
Emilis K	You forgot to mention the dual speakers üòé
All Usernames Taken	This is *the* Android phone. If I were to buy an Android, this would definitely be the one! The only thing missing is Qi Charging!
Titanclaw 24	Op 6 is still better.
Senne Weijmiens	I like the xiaomi mi mix 3 better than the 1+6T.
Alex Sutton	at least they provide a dongle...
BubleebuzzYT	ayyyyyy its kamikaze!
Deeparth Gupta	I get ~7 hour SOT with 30+ hour life on the OP6. I'm not kidding. Running a clean and lean system with a custom kernel is probably a large factor, I'm sure. I can't imagine what the 3700mah battery would be like.
vishal singh	Sorry to say, buts its way overrated, no infrared camera only rgb camera, they removed the back fingerprint, which is actually the most ideal place for any fingerprint sensor and replaced it with much slower indisplay sensor, no stereo sound, and final nail in the coffin, removed headphone jack, and for that notch, even the realme 2 pro has the same type of notch üòë looks like every youtuber is paid heavily for promoting this phone, everyone is biased üòê
Antoine Petit	I'm soooo bummed I got the 6 three months ago... This 6T is just better in every way for the same price. Amazing work OnePlus !
The Phoenix	Samsung, Lg and you forgot xiaomi (poco) .
Livio Kokthi	A great phone, but no more Never Settle. The touch screen fingerprint sensor is a gimmick for now, and the removal of the headphone jack is just bad.
daaper	VERY glad I picked up the 6 earlier this month and didn't wait for this. The limited improvements don't outweigh the drawbacks for me.
diogenes	I take a nap and OnePlus launches a new phone.
AxelTheHun	MKBHD listens to Eminem. Nice.
Tyler Kowch	Been an iOS user my entire life, but really thinking about switching to OnePlus or Pixel for my next phone. Currently have an iPhone 7 and thinking about updating within the next year. Thoughts?
aryaman Salaria	I dont agree that why they have removed the headphone jack like samsung galaxy note 9 has a spen , headphone jack but still has a bigger battery!! How???
drizlax	Is it just me or are phone reviews just flooding tech channels
Avratin	Another 1080p display, no headphone jack... Gonna be a fat NO from me.
Elvis Perika	Wait, doesn't the onscreen fingerprint  unlock thingy work without first having to press the power button? anyone know?
Jos√© Aponte	I'm thinking about why they killed the headphone jack: "We're taking out the jack.. I know 90% of the global population still uses wired headphones, but wireless is the Future, People!"
sha shamad	oh ..... i forgot to mention that this boy also one plus sheep .... no problem here because this phone is a really a perfect choice to be your daily driver ....  and to one plus fans here our congrats to you even if your phone is the same old one with some tweaks on it ....  ............  NOW I AM CONFIDENT TO SAY   MKBHD IS A BOY ... WHO IN LOVE WITH APPLE AND ONE PLUS ....EVEN WHEN THEY COME TO THE MARKETS WITH SMALL CHANGES HE WILL SHOUT FOR THAT .... BUT WHEN THE COMPETITORS CAME WITH MORE THAN HIS BELOVED APPLE AND ONE PLUS HE WILL IGNORE IT ......   WOOOOOOOOW .... NOW YOU ARE DEFENTLY SURLY CAN BE CALLED   FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN BOOOOOOOOOY   OUR CONGRATS TO YOU MKBHD
Maciek Waligorski	I would move the fingerprint reader to the back and keep the headphone jack. OnePlus once was about no gimmicks, flagship performance smartphones. They're in a weird place inbetween.
BarimirGames	what is your wallpaper on the phone?
Anjalena	Marques Brownlee *Please do NOT stop* telling us about those small, nitpicky, seemingly insignificant details around the UX (user experience) of a phone! Most reviewers ONLY cover those things that are relevant to most users, ie the most popular functions, features, design aspects, etc. However there are MANY of us who do NOT fit that very narrow mold. Each person uses their own phone differently, so those little nitpicky things become VERY important to people who don't necessarily use their phone exactly the same way as the masses.  Groups of people that Reviewers almost always forget when covering features and design elements of a new phone: Elderly Disabled   (my group)  By remembering to cover those small details, Marques, you include those forgotten groups to let them know of features that might be important to them. So thank you!  =)

Devvrat Toshniwal	I do the not see the value addition of having an on screen fingerprint reader. It will have a lot of complications I feel.   1. Slower 2. Do you need to wake the screen to unlock using your finger? Currently I just tap my finger and the whole phone wakes up 3. Reliability  I would not want to give up a proper fingerprint reader for a coolness factor
Zishawn Malik	This is literally the best phone I‚Äôve ever seen... fk me for getting the iPhone x
Abir Abid Khan	Mkbhd talks so slowly that I play his video with 1.25 times faster and it feels normal.

E123poptart4me	by far the best looking phone with a notch I‚Äôve ever seen
John Joel	What If One plus choose to triple their camera, thought it would have been a great upgrade. probably not same price.
‚Ä¢ ThatIrishboi	Currently watching this on my OnePlus X which I've had 3 years and has stayed up to date and not slowed down at all. All this for it being just a mid range phone of the time. I don't know a single person that has a phone done this at all be it an android or overpriced apple product. Have been planning to treat myself to a new OnePlus for a while now and I'm glad to see I'm getting better than what I planned for, for the same price. OnePlus, never change.
Jose Cente	I love the video format on my xs
Ali Ggg	Fuck sake
Michael McCann	For Verizon compatibility will it be certified so it will actually work or is it just the band support.  I saw they listed it on the carriers, but didn't say it exactly.
Kiran Muralee	The notch looks like the tiny drop of water just about to fell from the roof .
Felix Alfonso Covarrubias Perez	Looks like a beast of a phone!!
Hassan AhMAD	7:04 not quitely same... they bumped up the selfie camera
Hemajith Perera	I've been a OnePlus user since OnePlus one. They are great phones. Was looking forward to the 6T until I heard they are ditching the headphone jack. I connect my phone to lot of audio equipment. So sadly,  No more OnePlus for me. Good bye OnePlus.
wow1371	The removal of the headphone jack hit me hard, I am pretty much very happy I bought 6 in start of october and didn't wait for T version. I guess my next phone will be LG when that time comes, LG also has a really good amp and DAC (remember when Xperia zs had amazing dacs? how sad the times are now)

Zachary Snyder	I'm really impressed by this phone, but one of my favorite things to see these days are companies that swore they'd never get rid of the headphone jack.. get rid of the headphone jack.
Ramesh Nataraj	Any words regarding water resistance?
Castamere 1	Already upgraded to wireless headphones so don't mind the headphone jack being gone
Jay Breadon	It doesn't start at the same price. The OnePlus 6 retailed for $529, so the 6T's starting price is $20 more. More storage is a good trade-off, though.
NH Komaiha	Please... I NEED The wallpaper on the screen in the background
Jensen Cai Chen	Did he say compatibility with Verizon?!

Christoph Egger	- No headphone jack - No Wireless charging - No expandable storage (sd card) - No wide-lense / tele-photo lens (front & back) In terms of price and features i would prefer the Meizu 16th / 16th Plus over the OnePlus 6T. Not 100% certain how they compare in terms of build quality though.

Maharshi Patel	Why Apple removed headphone jack? I'm so pissed off. It is the most essential and basic part of a phone. And since Apple removed, all other mindless motherfucking assholes are doing the same. It is the most silly and worst decision in smartphones space. I hope Samsung and LG stick with 3.5mm jack and hopefully in near future again heaphone jack may come to all phones

Ash B	Good choice of music üëå
Aswin A	I thought the camera would be different. Also yes the animation's corny. They need to delete that. And btw do you need to press the power button before putting your finger? So that's two steps? I thought about upgrading from the 6 but even though it has bigger battery and storage, I'm a bit disappointed with the finger print reader and camera.

Israel Lewis	Marques is a Joyner Lucas man. Respect.
Hervyn Batista	I'll still take the Pixel 3/XL over this for its camera alone.
Sasa M	No headphone jack , Stereo  iP6  no buy
Andy Ferdean	The best improvement: smaller bezels, then bigger battery.
Berserker 108	Nice shirt
Amal Sankar.A	Wallpaper please
top5 mysterious	Huawei mate 20 pro is WAYYYY BETTER

Zulfiqar Ali	Meh, I am gonna stick to my OnePlus 6.
Christian Gravemaker	Dope t-shirt man
Apurba Samanta	Yes i'm buying it . Can anyone tell me what is the cable called to connect 3.5mm earphone to the phone?
AceSKYwalker	No headphone jack. No buy.

Ofek Harary	Uwu uwu tHeREs nO hEadPhONe jaCK  Time to move on. Wireless is the future.
Nimish Iwale	Wallpaper link?
Wynner3	Bluetooth audio is still crap compared to headphone Jack's. Doesn't make sense to remove it and not have an alternate way to charge.
Sammok Kabasi	Would you rather have a headphone jack, or a bigger battery?
Sourajit Deb	I need the wallpaper please link it in the next review
Robert Loyal	Definitely my next purchase.
Gustel	WOW easily the perfect phone for me. R.I.P headphone jack tho :(
Expat Props Mumbai	One Plus known for it's fluidity. That teardrop notch is a killer! Have a 5T (using it as my daily driver for over a year), the 6T is gonna be my next phone. Never looking back at another brand ever. Pre-Booked the 8 GB RAM/256 GB version in Germany.    No headphone jack a bummer but the Android experience on it makes up for it. One + is the fastest Android phone out there.
Atul Mandal	Leave the numbers aside, then vivo v11 is better than op 6t
Gym's Server	No stereo speakers? Bruh
Gag Gagva	Love ittttttttt
Wael Elwan	amazing ...but no 3.5mm jack ?  !!!!
Paulo Cassoma	üëåüèæüëåüèæ
Travel-Nomad	Oh maaaaan! I'd love to change my LG G2 for this one...
Pranav Joshi	Wallpaper?
oscarbergner	I actually already pre-ordered a Huawei Mate 20 Pro before op6t release, i don't regret it. It's more expensive but i think you get more phone out of it, and i dont change phones often, i wear them out, my current phone is a OP2 and i've been satisfied with it, but it's getting old, battery life is now terrible after over 3 years of usage. Well maybe i'll try OP after 2 years again, who knows. I still think Oneplus is a great company, but 6t is just to little improvement, and i like to try something new.
Mr. J	what the best budget 50$ phone would you recommend
PKM101	Something something headphone jack

Technical Emaan	Oneplus 5 expensive, 5t at same price  Oneplus 6 expensive than oneplus 5t, 6t same. Oneplus 7 what do you expect ?   Same price or increased price ?
Vitali	Great review.
Fluffy Greyfoot	TBH smartphones as a whole are getting more unappealing to me. Looking back at phones from a few years ago there were much more diverse options.  Nowadays they're all the same, and there's nothing that I feel like buying. Back in 2013, we had the choice of things like the Galaxy s4, the HTC One M7 , Nexus 5, the Moto X and the iPhone 5s. Different phones were actually, you know, different from each other back then. Since 2016 they've started to become more and more boring and removing features, hell maybe it started in 2015 with the Galaxy s6.
Jack Arildson	Top notch.
Nasi Lakornsri	when is oneplus 7 gonna come out and have anyone seen the mi mix 3?
L S	For me this is by far the better option when comparing it to the Pixel 3.
subhra jyoti Deb	Oppo Vivo generation
Alexandre Focante	One Plus 60 !
night owl	its my next phone. .
Ken Jones	I LOVE LOVE LOVE your production design! üòç Anyway I am not sure what I will do. I'm up for a new phone this month. The LGV40 is compelling, especially because I have been a LG user for years. If LG improves the software on their phone this cycle (not likely), It would be a VERY compelling phone. So trying something new seems risky.  That said I am happy the 1+ is coming to Tmobile.
mohamed salama	Cant they hide the camera under the glass instead of a notch.
Socrates Nicolaou	I'm still on my One Plus X and seeing that OnePlus is getting rid of the headphone jack is very disappointing. Why would they get rid of it? Also where is the micro SD card slot? I want to have a set of earbuds in my pocket or backpack and know that i will just plug them in and listen to my music. I don't want to worry whether they are charged or not! I want to keep my phone and buy a micro SD card and boost its storage capacity! This is getting out of hand because manufacturing wireless headphones with batteries in them and having to buy a new device or a more expensive one for the extra storage doesn't seem healthy to my pocket and the planet I live in. . I bought a OnePlus phone because it was it's own thing, it was different. If I wanted a device that copied every single thing the iPhone did I would buy a cheap iPhone knock off!
Umair Khalid	Like before watch üôÑ
dom.explores	I need this in my life
Utkarsh Raj	6T is more of a upgrade over OP6 than iPhone XS is over iPhone X and 6T is everything Pixel could not be. One Plus is doing great!
The RaRa85	They're still just using the second sensor only for depth perception?
Raghav Murthy	4:57 Marquees bumpin to Eminem's Kamikaze..
Brandon T. Smith	Fpr the notification LED on the S10 they should have a ring of the display light up on notifications to show how bezeless it is
Mohken	Just last year OnePlus was making fun of leaving the headphone jack out and now we're here. I'd take proper headphone jack over extended battery every day of the week (I guess that's the reason they removed it)
Aryaman Manish Joshi	Ok I don't care about the jack anymore, I'm buying this.
Armani Berrios	Still better than the pixel 3 xl
Al yasaa	That phone doesnt look good, you should give it away üòú (6T give away)
feralbear3615	Essential Phone already had a raindrop notch and it's a 1 year old phone, but the ergonomics are terrible.
Maverick DM	Someone give me this üòçi am currently using one plus 2 lol.a true one plus fan from india.
Johnathan Rogers	Where did you get that wallpaper at? ü§î
Andrew Biz	Maybe they hear to the fans - and in 2018 almost EVERYBODY is using wireless headphones. They and every other company on this planet know how many people are using "old" headphones on their devices.
Kulbir Ahluwalia	But should I wait for OnePlus7? ü§£
Tushar Biswas	Gift me a one+6T
Smund	Since it's such an incremental update I'll just wait for the Snapdragon 855.

Pranzal Singh	By the way which is this wallpaper that he has set as the background???
Iulian Dumbrava	Wallpaper, please ?
shockwave1	What would you say? This or the Mi Mix 3? I honestly do not like the new Android gestures. The Apple gestures are just better and I don't see a problem with just using them for Android because they're very good.  Also, are you going to review the Mi Mix 3?
San ket	Would rather wait for a better phone! üßê
Ben Tarran	Kinda of aniiing
MagentaRacer750	Nice shirt tho üëå
The Truman Show	Maybe they should make a damn headphone jack that is also a charger/usb and stop shafting us out of headphone jacks. Such a lame excuse.

Blind King	No headphonejack = it doesn't exist for me
Syed Akbar	Who else saw Eminem's kamakaze? Subscribed to this channel for his music taste üòÇ
Jampper	That fingerprint reader animation is pretty damn bad for a design perspective. I think i'll wait for the 7 which think won't have a notch at all.  My 3T still running fine altho battery life could be better. Still gets Pie which is awesome!
Lucas	Headphone jack removal is what the future is like. Wireless is the way to go. I don't understand why people are so against it.
Samuel Dzigba	It's quite sad that so many phones are now "headphone-jackless". Also, I think the in-screen fingerprint reader is futuristic, yes, but not as fast as the physical fingerprint reader. Now, I just hope Samsung and LG don't ditch the headphone jack as well.
Manji Irmiya	I only need Android P on my 5t and I'll be fine.
X TECH	Yeah Samsung is the real boss..!!!
Farjad Abdullah	Loving the cinematic bars!!
His Supreme Clarkson-ness	Don't care about an in-display fingerprint sensor, I'd much rather have a headphone jack.

Hans Lecaros	F#%& the headphone jack! Glad to see another company do it. Samsung is next!
Luv Singh	No headphone jack? A moment of silence for all those pubg mobile players who bought oneplus 6T without even knowing about this shocking thing
Akhilesh Kumar Akhil	Probably i will wait for one plus 7, because it will surely have better processor with 7nm tech.
yousef elbrolosy	Ok  End of the talk, This phone is a deal breaker
Takura Nyabvure	You should check out the xiaomi mi mix 3. Another flagship with a creative way to obliterate this ridiculous notch craze. I would love to see your review of one if you can!
Beyard L. Davis	Current One Plus X ( 2 the same ) Chose skins from link below I'll take 2 Again .. Never Settle..
abdulaziz alghothimi	Hey Marques! If I'm gamer what would you recommend me to buy this phone or new razer phone 2!  Thanks and best regards!  Abdulaziz
Coreyanos Hobbs	You the Maann,br≈ç!!!!!
Silviu Panainte	So with the OnePlus 6t you get double the standard storage, bigger battery, more screen, smaller chin and notch, in display fingerprint sensor, but everybody is complaning about the 3.5mm jack?? Imagine if OnePlus had the Pixel 3xl compromises..
Son37Lumiere	I'm disgusted by the industry, they're all pathetic followers. Just because Apple gets rid of something doesn't mean you should too.
Mico Man	Probably
Michael Kj√¶r	I was really hoping for a camera-censor upgrade - i feel this is one area where OP is still lagging behind competitors (mid-highend). I would have traded any one if the six mentioned upgrades for this.
Constantin Andrei	Nice video, I love this phone but have already the 6
P.F. YaBoi	Glass back and no wireless charging
Uwirlbaretrsidma.	6:13 bad splice
S F	Is it water proof
Jo√£o Carlos	A great desing. A good solution for the notch. Not too annoying. A bit big for my tastes, but ok. If it have around 5.5 to 5.8 inches would be a perfect "compact" phone for today¬¥s standards.
Kajornyod Thongkhot	VERIZON!!! FINALLY!!!!
Your wise cousin Joe	Apple is cancerous of tech world. Greedy and anti customer practice has breached into android platform.

Daryl John Tulay	Wallpaper?
Lefteris Lalos	anyone know the weather app at 1:00 ?
Leo Steinmetzer	I don't want to be that guy, but you keep saying volume instead of area. Your other phone review you also said volume.
Stephen Kendall	Didn't OnePlus 6 start at $529 for 6/64? The other RAM/storage configs are the same price but base one is a bit more.

Hektor Athan	You have to do definitely a blind camera test
Advaith Chinni	I hope Samsung doesn‚Äôt kill the headphone jack anytime soon
Julien Goltzman	does anyone know if it has expandable storage?
Furqan	no headphone jack?? how hard is it to put a headphone jack in the phone ffs.
Cubamus Prime	If One Plus wants me to take them seriously then add expandable storage, a better implementation of a secondary lens wide-angle or telephoto lens.
Minhas Ali	Xiaomi mi mix 3. Best notchless design. 10w Wireless charger is bundled with the box. Which is absolutely insane.  Oneplus gets all the attention just because they use nearly stock android os.
hey dad	WAIT NOOOO THE HEADPHONE JACK DUDEE ONE PLUS WHAT HAVE YOU DONEE
Horse with no name	Some comfort to those who bought the one plus six (-t)!
Joaquim Silva	I still think the Mi Mix 3 is a better option
Dewsy Sipos	"Qulacomm back in techtober!"

Serhiy Todosan	6:01 I died at this moment...
Saswat Sarangi	i think the headphone jack on LG G7 Plus ThinQ , the audio output is good, i mean better than others, like other jack and type-c headphone 6:58 what's on the right side of phone? i think the animation in fingerprint scanner causes delay, i know u said light needed, but Vivo does it without causing much light
Rahul Dhali	Google , take notes on how to make a notch !
Rui Cardoso	Oppo R17 clone
TheHermit	I like it, despite the fact that they removed the headphone jack. At least they didn't go all crazy with the pricing and still managed to keep it reasonable.... unlike some pretentious manufacturers.
Mr Andy	ƒ∞t's 2018..... DONT NEED HEADPHONE jack. Everything is going wireless. Get a Bluetooth headset. Those that complain about no headphone jacks are the ones holding US BACK especially the innovations of wireless technology.  I use Bluetooth headphone on my phone, TV AND laptop, I swap at a push of a button... ƒ∞t's CONVENƒ∞ENT AF.
Â∏ÉÊãâÂæ∑Â±ÅÁâπ	MATE 20 PRO: I am not nervious at all.

itchylibido	Headphone Jack now. Charge port nextüëéüëéüëé
Dennis Deveaux	Wasn't the OnePlus 6 $529 for the 64GB model? $20 for double the storage isn't bad, but it makes your title and the repeated comments of "same price" wrong.
Simon Lu	Why isn't their any comparison to Huawei mate 20 pro?
Kevin	Damn I was really considering this to be my next phone, but a single speaker, and no guarantee of water resistance is kind of a deal breaker.   This is what I'm looking for - Fantastic Software - Fantastic Camera - Water Resistance - Preferably, in a smaller form factor  My top contenders are the Pixel 3 (not XL) and the XS  Any recommendations?

Art handcraft	5:03 kamikaze üòçüòçüòçüòç I love you even more now mkbhd
WALID ALHADDI	What you forgot is that most of the hardware is 5 - 7 months old which means the hardware components are cheaper for 1+ to purchase.  Their manufacturing process is also established now since there aren't major differences between the 6 and 6T (screen and battery are components shipped to 1+ from a supplier).  1+ should have dropped the price of the phone $30 to $50
Akshat Gandhi	Is it just me or does the navbar not have a back button?
Imad Sani	really not a fan of that fingerprint animation and as Linus pointed out the phone goes to full brightness when you want to unlock it which is going to be super annoying at night

MrHunter r	Dat wallpaper? Anyone...?
Ognjen Milosevic	Best phone atm.
Micha√´l Debrier	sort of makes me regret buying a oneplus 6 but im still very happy with it
Saptarshi Bhattacharjee	People comparing this with IPhones and Samsungs without even taking into the account the price at which this phone is competing. Providing some dope ass tech at this margin point is unfuckingbelievable. You can't make everyone happy at the same time. Oneplus 6 broke the sales record last time in India, this one will exceed that. No bloatware, bigger battery, a very good design and a fingerprint sensor that's going to be better with updates. I would say they have nailed this. Never Settle. üíü‚ô†Ô∏è
Perpetratorn	Looks great! I've got the OnePlus6 and the only thing I kinda feel I'm missing out on is the bigger screen and battery, but having a headphone jack is a good trade, and basically the reason why I bought the OP6 instead of anything else (and the price ofc.).   I'm using dark mode on my phone, and I try to use Amoled Black backgrounds as well, and I get about 6 hours of screen time with it! Never had a day when it fully discharged. I've kind of changed my charging pattern too, with the Dashcharge I can just charge it for half an hour or so when I'm going to bed, then unplug and have it in bed listening to YT when going to sleep, no need to keep it charging all night as I'm used too. Feels safer, and I'm never below 85% in the morning. 85% still takes me through a full day too.   Love the new look, but I'm kinda pissy about them removing the headphone jack, that's going in the wrong direction imho. Don't remove features, add them.
winter orange	No headphones jack. Tett.. Cancel. Close.
Danny Vega	Just bought the oneplus 6 thanks to your reviews! Hoping the price goes down soon cause of the 6t release so I can get the difference with my citi price rewind. üëç
Erik	It is gonna be my next phone. Ordering it online asap.
ravi savaliya	Its a better than any other mobile
okniceguy	Would be my next phone if it had wireless charging.
NorX826	Just set a reminder to purchase one on Thursday! Can't wait. Figured I'd try to buy one of the 128gb , 8gbs ram flat black models.  People who have ordered through OnePlus before, do they normally make enough phones as to not be back ordered immediately? This will be my first OnePlus phone. Thanks!
JITHIN A JOHN	What about stereo speakers??
Davor Bertovic	Thanks for keeping the 2:1 format  Looks awesome on new phones and also black bars on my ultra wide monitor are now finally smaller

Reuben Simon	My J7 Neo has a pretty good battery life. I can go about two days without charging it
raney150	That notch is almost, but not quite, bearable. I'm still super against the notch though.
Washington Redskins Fan Vlogs Too	It‚Äôs a great looking phone and it doesn‚Äôt bother me that they removed the headphone jack neither. Is T-Mobile the only carrier that‚Äôs going to have the OnePlus 6T phone?
Kim Deen	@Marques Brownlee is it Waterproof?
Abhyuday Tewari	Mr. Mobile says that there's been a sorta irritating price bump. MKBHD says "same price"   _hmm_
James Nealey	This is most definitely my next phone. No doubt about it. I'm a Bluetooth kind of guy so no 3.5mm jack is trivial at best.
ÿ≥ŸÑ€åŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ∞ŸàÿßŸÑŸÅŸÇÿßÿ±	Please review the Mi Mix 3 or the Honor Magic 2, they are more interesting.
Poul Haacker	The in screen reader makes a ton of sense, when your phone is laying on your desk. With out a front facing fingerprint reader, you have to lift the phone, or do the pattern unlock/code to unlock the phone. Not important to me, but I can see how it may be useful to some people.
Ryknex's Channel	Is it me? o the back of the phone looks ugly
Lazy Abram	No headphone jack no thanks
Paul Shakeshaft	No headphone jack, no wireless charging,  this is not going forwards it's a backwards move End of story....
Charlie Sutcliffe	can you do a video comparing the oneplus6t and the Google pixel 3 please?
TaoBao lLanza	onscreen finger scanner is worst idea of 2018... what a a shame and works slower than iPhone 5s touch id which is older than my grandma

bijaya shrestha	Does this work on sprint network? üò≥üò≥
David Buza	Where did you get those wallpapers?
Zeus54321	So, is there a notification led or not? I didn't get that part. If it's gone, it would be quite the compromise imo.

Souljabroable West	A company like one plus introduced an under screen fingerprint scanner and google just released the pixel 3 and uses 2017 technology, I expected google to be good enough to come up with a better phone but it turns out it got surpased even by oneplus...
Isthiyaque kambathagothi	I heard OnePlus is going to be first phone to have 5G connection ?
Jeroen Neumann	I need that wallpaper! Where can I get it?
Martin I√±aki Lazatin	No headphone jack. Nope. Sorry. Deal breaker. I just watched this video with my earphones on.

Panzone Caduto di Faccia	how often does it happen that you have to charge your phone and use headphones at the same time ? never, that's the answer
MyhcA	Wait so no improvement on the camera?
Kevin Calif	huawei mate 20 pro has the best battery life ^^
Anti-Rage	Can you do a review on xiomi mi mix 3?
shreyas dixit	does it have dual stereo speakers ?
The Rambler	I've been using bluetooth headphones and earphones for a year now and its been pretty awesome. The cordless experience is just so addicting I haven't used my normal earphones in months, I think the headphone jack is in the twilight of its years. Apple was right all along, bluetooth ear pieces are the future.
Shekhar Swarnakar	Two major issues on this device are: 1. Notch. 2. Removal of 3.5mm jack.
racerx3065	No more notification LED? :(
Timi Akinlonu	The fingerprint scanner is a joke, they should have gone with an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
Ivan Konami	Why have you switched to 18:9 aspect ratio, while most of people still have 16:9 phones/monitors?
Dennis Uzoh	Nice phone but rather wait for the S10 and note 10
jared benayon	6:33 StockX app. Hmmm. New sneakers marques??
Abiola Olayinka	My next phone is totally gonna be the 6T. God helping of course. Just have to wait for OnePlus 7 to come out so it's price drops ü§ß‚ú®
John Murray	So it will work , fully on Verizon , I‚Äôm pumped I have been waiting for one plus to be compatible with Verizon
Lukie Kun	Wait, so Since MetroPCS/Metro by T-Mobile *is* T-Mobile, will Metro get the phone aswell? Ive heard a bit on it, but I still dont know for sure if I have to get an unlocked version from another store.
Davey Enjan	Add a few mm of thickness=remove camera bump+retain headphone jack+increase battery size.
drepidge	How's the Apple Watch while using the 6T as a daily driver?
Purnendu Sabar	Fingerprint sensor is taking so long time
Luke Beattie	I really hope this phone catches on. It would bring down prices of the competition. A win for us all.

Andy Raman	Meh where is Red hydrogen meh
KingDavid	It's time to get over the headphone jack y'all. It's not coming back to phones, and we're about 24 hours from Apple killing it on tablets too
Ryan Bob	That thumbnail tho
Reed Baker	Why can't Apple's S upgrades be like this
Ovando Graham	I‚Äôm either gonna buy the pixel 3 (I don‚Äôt care about the notch) or the one plus 6t. Opinions guys ?
Akatsuki Gang	Apple remove headphone Jack  -Everybody copy Apple brings notch  -Everybody copy Apple removes camera -Everyone else probably gonna copy  Cmon Android ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶    It's a sad year for Android smartphones
SapuSeven	For me, the bigger battery and the fingerprint scanner are definitely worth the missing headphone jack.
Arima Haise	I would have waited for oneplus 6tüò´üò´feels sad man
TheMontegonian	Hey Marques, what launcher were you using?
Nate	No headphone jack? Thank god! For a while, I thought I wouldn't have to charge my headphones. What an improvement.
SIMFUN	looks even worse than a real notch in my opinion.. so wrong..
Darshan Dhande	We need to remove the headphone jack. We need to go towards the future. Move to Type C.
Rashed Elahi	A full review on Huawei Mate 20 Pro please!
Harshit Chandel	I have recently upgraded from s7 edge to s9+ . Should i now upgrade to 1+6t ?
Daniel Wallberg	If money ain't the problem.. Oneplus 6t or Huawei 20 pro mate?  I mainly care about camera and battery performance
goduxunike	As a OnePlus 6 owner, I'm only mad about the price of the 6Gb version with 128gb internal storage. Damn it.
Chris c	Stupid question. Worth upgrading from a op3

Charlesawesome Furtado	"It's bleeds from your fingers toward your eyes". Just close your eyes then, sheesh
Aryan Upadhyaya	U MEAN NOTCH AREA NOT NOTCH VOLUME!!
Set Up	Do you need to wake up the phone to unlock using finger print?
Jimpo Z	Evryone talking about 6t. No one talks about Xiaomi Mi Mix 3.
Prince Yanel	A smaller notch is always better.
Mannan Siddiqui	@MKBHD replying to your 3:17 & 4:00  What if unlocking your 6t device doesn't really unlock with your finger print scanner.....ü§®ü§® What if  it's too slow to process your finger print, at day it does not require too much light that is why it switch to full brightness at night and unlock with your "FACE ID" all the time and when failed it scan your finger print ...................ü§îü§îü§î  i could be completely wrong its  just a theory .....üòú OnePlus 5t user
Kyler Endicott	I want to love it, but I need me that IP6X security. I've killed too many phones since I've been buying swimsuits with pockets
Blackman Whitesuit	I want to believe them, but phone companies have been using that same excuse for a while now that I can't
TimmyToaster5	Phone wallpaper link? Looks so nice
Geez, Mahn!	Honestly, I'm not impressed.
Ariel Kaplan	im getting bored from the notch design and head-phone jack being removed , pure stupidy and i guess people still dumb to believe that wireless is better and that we have adaptors . what are we fu**ing apple ??? You get less quality in music and even if you still want to listen to music you need to buy a new pair of wirless headphones (most of them expensive and not worth the price) or that pathetic rubber stuff they call dongle  !!!!!!!! that is just marketing at it's best
Saptarshi Mandal	Is it waterproof??

Kawser Ahmed	Mi mix 3 review pls  And say mi mix 3 or 6T who better?
Admin	Google should learn from this notch

Rahul P G	Watching this on my OnePlus 6
Gianluca Venditti	How are the speakers now that they have two speaker grills at the bottom? Is 6T offering stereo speakers?

DerParadonym	One manufacturer does notch: Marques: "I hate notches" - All manufacturers do notches: Marques: "You get used to notches." - I'm pretty sure something deep inside Marques still desperately hate notches.
Darryl e Bostic	This is Apple's World!!!!

Luke Helton	This is definitely the Android phone I would buy.
Michael Kantorski	Holy shit! I was just about to say I hate being on Verizon since we hardly have any phones, and then you said to Verizon compatible!? No way!
xfghkhjfsejid	Oneplus 60?      Wow, where did all the other Oneplus' end up?
Chrillele	Do you think that i should buy the OnePlus 6T?
Simmmy	I honestly would have a hard time choosing a phone, because there are so many great phones and they're so similar. It's like picking between a choclate chip cookie and a darker choclate chip cookie.
Chaitanya Manwar	Is it more faster than new google and iphones
How to Bros	wallpaper please!
Stephany Stephen	Does size of notch matter that much üòêüòê...??
Sushibomb	Honestly when the iPhone x came out I was confused how they were gonna use finger print scanning so I thought it was gonna be on the screen. Cool to see a phone do this feature
ArnoldsK	Is it just me or the fingerprint sensor is still the best on the back? You take the phone out of the pocket and unlock it while doing that.
RP Trucker	In a Note 8 on ATT and I‚Äôm getting tired of being stuck on same software versions all the time. Samsung and att have this thing about not pushing updates so I am still on 8.0.0.  Will either go unlocked this go around or maybe a Note 9.
member2126	Its hard to say but I think we have finally come to a place where all android phones suck and somehow apple phones keep getting better. ( coming from someone who has always used android phone )
Theworld214	Does anyone give a shit about the notch like it‚Äôs not a big deal
MikeTheShadowWolf	What on earth is with this complaining about fingerprints???? what are you even talking about? I've never EVER heard ANYONE say that "Oh my phone looks so ugly with all the fingerprints on the back". If the material collects fingerprints then  it collects fingerprints. You don't care about that if you're one of the 1% of people who have an obsession to show off what phone they use to everyone, and even if you are then you're still not going to give a crap about some fingerprints that you can wipe off in two seconds.
dsaf dsaf	Man the original Mi Mix still has a great 6.4' notchless display that is still not that common. It still has a bigger battery than most flagships and a higher quality build as well as a more luxurious feel.
eagle horn	Can it be changed for OP6?? Ahahah
Tristzn	For sure my next phone will be a 1+
Eclectic Insanity	Why is this video saying that it requires payment to watch?

Mr Music	M√∂th is a big fan √∂f this ph√∂ne!
Bhavani Singh Yadav	I am confused. Can you or can you not unlock the phone with the in-built fingerprint sensor without turning on the screen? I mean do we have to press the power button everytime to use the fingerprint sensor?
sharkhark	This video requires payment to watch? What the f_ck is that? I've never seen this message on YouTube... Ever before... Maybe for a movie etc I could understand but a review? Let me know if this is legit if so I'll unsubscribe.  Edit! I tried 3 more times wouldn't play so I went to other people reviewing then came back now it plays? I have no idea what's going on....1st time this has happened.
Sanu Singh	Why to put the fingerprint scanner under the hood ??? When its working very fine at the back..just waste of resources rather it should have gone with wireless charging and with headphone jack
Craig S	No head phone jack and good forbid I crack my screen. That's will end fingerprint scanner. I love my one plus 6. Not happy about the changes to the t

gavin myloff	Xiaomi pocophone f1 still rocking headphone jack, would love to see a comparison video between these 2 devices
Adam Marchuk	This video requires payment to watch?
Jacob Huscher	Link for the wallpaper?
Ahmed G	Not for me... call me old school but i still use an AUX cord in my car, and i don't want to carry a dongle that i might lose everywhere...  the fingerprint thing kinda is a big deal... i use my phone a lot in the dark at night... and it'll be kinda annoying to have that bother you every time u hear the notification sound and want to check your e-mail or twitter or something...  also i feel the back fingerprint sensor is better because you could find it by feel without looking... while you probably can still find this sensor without looking after awhile i feel it would be much harder than the back sensor.  also to be honest the pocophone just broke my brain soo much.. even tho i cant get it unless i import it (which means i get no support). that every phone i look at right now just fails in comparison...
Diego De Schuyter	Hey Marques , is the phone still splashproof? They haven't talk about it so much
scootercrossking	2 extra GB of ram for only $30?? That has got to be the best priced upgrade I've ever seen from a phone manufacturer!
AbRa CaDaBrA	Nope, any phone over 6 inches will not be my next phone.

Rashed Pahlavi	Hi MKBHD!!!  I'm using Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus  & I'm impressed about the wide angle video from last couple of videos.  Which is too suitable for my phone & its looks gracious.  Fan from Bangladesh  üáßüá©
Esko Tuomioja	Since you started doing 2:1, my Samsung tv doesn't play your videos in 4K. Can anyone explain? Is it just that it doesn't support 2:1 4K, but why wouldn't it?
game action 47	üò≠üò≠why 18:9 so ugly
BigmacmealYT	18:9 ratio..cool
MHS	The curvy notch is better
Patricio Roldan	This one and the Mi Mix 3 are the best smartphones of the year....especially considering the price / quality ratio
Qahwajugga	I'm not bothered by the speed of the fingerprint scanner. As long as it's secure and does the job then I don't mind wasting that extra millisecond
karnik kalani	Fuckin slow fingerprint scanner and no headphone jack         A no thank you üôè

Luukas02 Lampe	Got the note9 yesterday, no thanks
Stephen Johnston	In the video he pushes the power button first to turn the screen on, then unlocks with fingerprint.  Do you have to turn the screen on?
Matti Keski-Kohtam√§ki	I'm surprised to notice how you missed the fact that the notch shape really plays well with the android animation design style.
Green Cat	"Techtober"  That word... That fucking word... In your every video... I cannot stop clenching my teeth... ... STOP SAYING THAT.
Blink 503	Is the headphone jack removal the biggest deal breaker of the phone, for one hole gone your giving up a cheap on par and even better flag ship phone then most apple and android phones
Laaka Motlogelwa	We want that headphone jack and expandable storage!.. the finger print scanner isn't that necessary
Benjamin Ewald	Me: "Wow that phone looks really good! I think I might buy i-" MKBHD: "There's no headphone jack" Me: "Guess not"

Ryan Cowan	wired head phones are a joke
Michael Koller	I can deal with the 1080P display but leaving out wireless charging in 2018 is a deal breaker. It reminds me of the year they left out NFC.
death wings	mkbhd can you give me a phone ?
Divesh Tanwani	Anyone else notice the Kamikaze album at 4:58?
Mhamad Riyad	I don't understand what's the problem of having a regular super fast fingerprint reader on the back! It looks fine and it does work very well in comparison with in-screen fingerprint reader. All I'm saying is I feel like phone companies are just trying to be first instead of being more functional!

654pedro123	4:28 I like that you mention small things like that.
MaGNaCET33	Fuck this no headphone jack, I am so happy that I bought the Oneplus 6. TLDR: no headphone jack is one of the WORST THINGS that are happening to phones. It is a downgrade and absolutely stupid.   You might think that I am too angry and outdated but I refuse to not being able to charge my phone while listening to music via a cable. (I do this on a daily basis) This is so much more convenient, Bluetooth is INFERIOR in sound quality and it wastes more battery.  You might say, fine just go with Bluetooth headphones and you won't need any adapter - THE ABSOLUTE WORST SHIT ABOUT THAT  IS THAT I HAVE TO CHARGE MY HEADPHONES. I HAVE TO REMEMBER TO CHARGE MY HEADPHONES IF I JUST WANT TO USE THEM!!   I have to remember to carry a USB c to headphone jack adapter that I can lose instantly and might have to buy a larger adapter that will allow me to charge my phone and connect my headphones at the same time.  This is stupid, There is no effective replacement to the headphone jack at the moment. I have to carry useless adapters (that I can lose without realizing it) just in order to use my headphones.   If  by chance I forgot my adapter at home and my headphones don't have Bluetooth connectivity I AM FUCKED.
Matt Guerrero	will the 6 still be sold after the 6t launch? Not sure about the headphone jack situation.
Casually Cubing	Shit that wallpaper is sick!!!! Where can I find it?
Evarist Paul	OP6 with Headphones Jack
Aryaman Mehrotra	720p60 is the best quality on YouTube

Afaq Ahmed	Wallpaper link plz
Luis Rafael	Oneplus picked up where  nexus left off. This is what the pixel should be. Can you imagine the 6T with the pixel camera. Come on google make it happen, just buy Oneplus!!
khoa1708	the people who keeps complaining about the headphone jack... MOVE ON! it's getting annoying listening to you all... technology evolve, it updates, always been and always will... either adapt or get left behind... complaining about it won't do anything  if you hear anyone else right now complaining about CDs, DVDs, analog tvs, etc... won't you find it annoying as well? btw... what more do you people want? they included a dongle for you to use your headphones right? STOP COMPLAINING!  what will you all do when NO PHONE manufacturers have a headphone jack? just stop using mobile phones all together?
Cedric Clement	I have a 3T, would this be a worthy upgrade?
MightyRaptor 990	That's how you make a notch... Yes I'm talking to you Google
Eric Allan	I think Sammy & LG r never gonna get rid of the headphone jack.

Dazd Goodovich	Stereo speakers?
Onur Y	Never settle is their slogan and they remove headphone jack......
Pavan Khemalapure	Does it support dual 4g LTE?
David Phan	The no-headphone jack is the deal breaker for me. The on-screen fingerprint reader is really unnecessary and I actually prefer it to be on the back. Guess I'll be looking for the Galaxy s10.
Simon Suomela	This new aspect ratio you use is very enjoyable to watch on my iPhone X. Juuuuust before the notch gets in the way and pretty good in height aswell! I‚Äôd like if you kept making videos using it üòä
Nicolaj H	The size is a defiant deterrent for me. If you've ever held an S9 or P2, you'll know what i'm talking about.
Akshay Rathin	great
CnF C.W P	Its about how you feel using a phone.
maxmander	Headphone jack is still a must. Thank god I have the OnePlus 6.

Bilal Aslam	The screen looks exactly like the realme 2 pro
Zayed Talukdar	No headphone jack, I‚Äôm out
FEMINISTS and SJWs are terrorists	Can we go back to 16:9 now they we have gestures?? The screens are too long
Muhd Khafoor	What about the speaker, are they still mono? OnePlus people should change it to  studio ones.
Franklin Minang	These wide angle videos look awesome on my 1+6
Salman I. Mohammed	My sister is looking get her first phone i think this would be a grest choice cuz my parents wanna spend 500 to 700  but u dumbfuck people will be like eww an android so i guess she gonna buy the iphone 8 or 7
pinaki chall	that notch looks like tesla logo
Sathu	This notch is tolerable
Sudielmae Lee	Prefer the rear fingerprint scanner (more secure).  Thus, I just lost for next phone.
Sam Kumar	I don't dig the inscreen fingerprint reader because, just like face id I have to wake the screen first to unlock the phone using my fingerprint.

Nayan Lalit	What about the new gesture UI which was announced ? Any word on that ?
Zero_73	So Crispy
Iulian Moise	Nice video mate! I'm a proud owner of the 5T, happy to that OnePlus is still delivering good phones :)  Help a man here, where can I find the wallpaper that you used on this video?
Electropretzel	The funny thing is that I'm looking for a new phone and one of the major factors for my decision is the headphone jack. So good job apple, google and one plus for loosing a customer.
DTMF223	That notch looks way better than every single other phone with a notch imo. Way less intrusive and just flows with the top of the phone. Great job there! (I still hate notches in general)
Raghav Verma	Did you notice kamikaze on Spotify
MiChAeLo KGB	I have my OnePLus 6 and if I really wanted a new phone, I probably would be able to live without the Jack, but they also removed the notification LED and the fingerprint sensor is quite inconsistent now... All that combined, it wouldn't make the decision between 6 and 6T as easy as I thought (ignoring that I already have a 6).  Also, about the bright screen because of fingerprint sensor, the 6 if you have face unlock enabled (I guess 6T does that too) will blast whole screen white on max brightness to light you up so you can unlock the phone in the dark... It works quite well for unlocking the phone and for making you blind...
Thie M	Watching this on my OnePlus One, still the best !
Himanshu Srivastava	Can anybody give me the download link of this wallpaper?? ü§î
Joseph Ralph	*This is downgrade compared to OnePlus 6. They removed the headphone jack and we did not ask for under the screen SLOWER fp reader*
Stetson Doggett	The fingerprint reader and face-unlock already seem like a NIGHTMARE on this phone. No intuitive place to rest your finger along with a suddenly FULL BRIGHTNESS screen seems like a very poor user experience. I would *strongly* prefer an on-the-back fingerprint reader over an under-the-display-glass finger print reader. On-the-back is fast, intuitive, and out of the way.
Moin Islam	man i bought the op6 a couple months ago... now this released...
Dovah Kiin	Aight this is what I needed!!! I'm tired of my essential phone the camera is worst than the original HTC one (m7).if this comes to t-mobile I'm 100%getting it. If not ill definitely think about it.
Yahia Al-atiyah	Once Oneplus gets a pay service as good as samsung pay I'll switch back to oneplus. Today I'm happy with a galaxy s9.
Red Pink and twice	I will still buy op6 lol
Ergid	reading sum comments in the one plus'es page on insta, some people telling the fact that why majority of followers were complaining about the removal of the jack.... it's  futuristic to apply  in display fingerprint and having a non wire device connected to the phone.... My opinion,: EXCUSE ME????????????????????????????????????? is it futuristic to downgrade from 0.1 sec fingerprint reader from the physical reader to some 0.5 or even 1 sec delay in the in-display reader? i think the  H E C K not
J_laubster	you gunna just skip over that amazing hid notch feature that still leaves notifications up there, dang thats sexy af
Slixbrah	Now they removed headphone jack, I have no reason to buy it, thanks one plus.
Zanna	Why is no one reviewing the xperia phones
Thomas T.	So we all know NOW why his pixel 2xl was lagging only on him.........HMMM..
Rocco Ilaria	why not keeping the fingerprint reader behind?
Shak81	People are definitely over fucking reacting to the no headphone jack.. This device is wonderful at 550 bucks.. WOW!!
Rohit Shreenivas	Samsung, the only company that's not blindly following the unnecessary things such as the notch, the on-screen fp sensor, the no headphone jack nonsense... can't wait for the Galaxy S10!!
Salvatore Anzalone	Can't wait to pick this up. Ive been meaning to upgrade from my OP3 for some time now.
LiverpoolYNWA	Guys just wait abit more for the S10 as that phone is gnna be revolutionary and it just will have the headphone as Samsung don't follow others *cough* oneplus *cough*
amowic	Looks so sexy
Tak√°cs J√≥zsef	Yes. I had a OnePlus One until last year. Now, a Xiaomi Mi A1, because of Android One (codename "bug collection").
Srinivasan Jayaram	As usual a superlative review and unbiased too. Great and keep it up.
WeTubeNL	What we need is an objective eye on how the 6T measures up against the Xiaomi MI Mix 3...Help us out here...
THE BIGGEST FAN	Seems like the best budget phone imo
Max Lyshtva	1:10 look at the reflection in the window))

SecretAgentJames	1. Fingerprint reader should be triggered anywhere on the screen, not only the bottom center of screen.  2. The whole point of having it on screen is to have more freedom and easier to unlock, not just aesthetics.
Anton Goykhman	Please no more notch. This one is ugly.
TechMallu	Still no Vooc ?
Greg Widzik	Yes it's my next Phone update from old iPhone
David S. Hasanli	Anyone gets " this video requires payment to watch" message ?
John Enright	The Honor series still has a head phone jack
swizzy	NEW PHONE! üòçüî•
Jimmy Liu	Where did he get that Casey Neistat shirt!?
Mo A	FoShow'!
IZZUDDINIZZU46	Toss in a screen fingerprint sensor and then remove the headphone jack... Is it really necessary tho?
Shailansh Gaur	OnePlus and google got fucked up for both 6t and 3xl
Hakim Din	Coming from a 5T user, this phone actually disappoint me when they remove the headphone jack and the fingerprint sensor at the back. The sensor in 5T and 6 is actually the feature that i like. You have a very fast response sensor to unlock your phone(compare with this 6T) and the position at the back,is just natural for you to put your index finger there. So its really easy for me to unlock the phone (without pressing the power button first) or if i'm using an apps (while using one hand) and i want to slide down the notification bar. Watch unbox therapy review about the 5T if you don't understand what i'm talking about.
Sonic Boom	I hate notches...but i actually prefer this one over the others....
Issac Newton	*They were making fun of Apple for no headphone jack.* üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Md. Hamiduzzaman	Any news for Water Resistance?
HORISON	weird thing to say but you look like swooz1e
Sharadh Chandra Banoth	when you realise it's not the same price
maninder singh	Man this video's aspect ratio cutting little bit into my OnePlus 6's notch. Didn't happened in last 2 videos of yours, don't know what changed üòï
shivankit ss	Why do we waste so much time discussing about phones and what mistake the company did. ??
InvisiMan	I'd rather pay $1000+ for a Samsung Note. Too many compromises with OnePlus phones. They Settled years ago.
Deaf Kid	How is the vibration motor? That's one of the only things I don't like about my One Plus 3T.
Narsi Nisha	Still getting me an iPhone xr. Sorry guys
Roborav	Another boring assed phone same as the rest of them. You put this in a line and they all look the bloody same. Phones are so stale now they have nothing new on them.
MacOS	I like that they finally found their own design language, looks amazing
It's FreeCaddy	caption says it's a one plus 60ü§¶
NewUser Mohammed	You was in the live üòá
amol bachhav	No one wants fingerprint under the screen they are too slow.  Eliminating one plus 6t will bring that one plus to one minus. I give you written.
PandemicLui	these phones are amazing, how ever just like last year i bet samsungs going to suprise us, maybe *cross fingers* camera behind display? larger battery? better larger display? even faster charging? i hope samsung doesnt take away the audio jack, id hate to bring adapters everywhere i go.
dlberker	Not a fan of the fingerprint reader under the glass.  Why is this better than the reader on the back of the phone?  For me, this is a reason why I'm going to buy a 6 instead of 6t.
Brandon Hughes	I do believe this is my next phone
suban khan	You r the best bro.  Love from India
KeRIIval	Ooooh the headphone jack!!! Why!!! OK imma buy the oneplus 6 because of that
Yassine Zanina	For all the people who say I am not buying it because there is no headphone jack and they have "expensive headphones"... if u had the money to afford an expensive headphone u might as well buy wireless ones, I mean its been pretty obvious that all companies, including Samsung and LG, will eventually ditch the jack, so its really an old and lame excuse, to me this phone is worth buying...
Nihaal Ahamed	Do we have to press the lock button in order to scan the finger print on the screen every single time?
Mic Rose	I'm not a fan of the notch but this is easily the BEST implementation of the notch on any smartphone!
[ P R A D H U N Y A ] K	Should I update my oneplus 6 to pie or stick to Oreo ?
Victor	I need that wallpaper you're using on the OnePlus
meri babic	That fingerscan on full brightness is a deal breaker for me. I'm probably getting Oneplus 6, it does seem like an awesome phone and a low price is a huge bonus!
Vichente.	still looks like a cheap iPhone for me.
Ricardo Rodrigues	Been thinking about this one to replace my Nexus 6P, but the screen DPI is much lower. Do you notice between this one and say the Pixel 3 XL any difference in screen res?
Scott Pessetto	Been wishing it was Verizon compatible for years
Ricardo Mateus	Wait..... Do you have to wake up the phone before the in-screen fingerprint reader works??? If that's the case, I think that's a bit of a bummer!
Maxxwell Walt	OnePlus are complete liars!!!! No space for headphone jack?? Whats wrong if they just say they've  decided to copy Apple..   Vivo Nex S has alomst the same body size as OnePlus 6T, a 6.5" screen on Vivo and 6.4'' on 6T. Yet Vivo also has the under the display optical fingerprint reader, a 4000mah  (FOUR THOUSAND) Battery, A Motorized POP-UP front facing camera(if you need to see how this  Motorized POP-UP camera system takes space go see JerryRigEverything teardown of the Vivo) and Still the Vivo Nex S has the Headphone jack...   These manufactures have just found a way to make people pay more in the name of the future/technology. Well this is not a goodbye to the headphone jack, Its a goodbye to Quality Audio that could be improved to reach HiFi studio quality audio on the go as LG phones do provide.. a least there is a last man standing.. for how long that we do not know!!
suri4Musiq	Love the Casey neistat t-shirt though ;)
Subham Guha	Best phone of 2018...
Jennslife09	Will this work on Sprint?
Venkat Prashant	Loving the full screen videos, keep up the good work!
Zq	I'm so proud of OnePlus for the T-Mobile deal or whatever! ü§ó
PixelJunk 89	I get about 5 to 6 on screen time on my battery on my Moto z2 running Android 8.0 on a 2700 mah battery without power saver. I can expect much more on this one. :) Idk why you guys get less I guess most consumers don't manage battery life but I am a tech nerd and I keep it clean. I even took the plastic of this shit screen and replace it with glass and I have never been happier running near stock. never the less this is cake for me.... To baad I'm broke to even afford a cheaper phone üò≠ I bought this one 2 hand for 50$ blacklisted just to use with WiFi lol work's great
Diego Juan	I was like ok well.. I guess I can buy my Bullets wireless now... guess what? The voucher they gave me for RECOMMENDING PEOPLE TO THE COMPANY expired , and the only reason I couldn't use the voucher before was because the bullets wireless were always sold out.
Chris Harrington	So you have to turn on the phone and then unlock it using the fingerprint reader? Ugh.
Jenelly	Well .... think I want one now. üòê
Fun M.r	Look at that üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
Santosh B	Only for you have watched the complete ad without skipping....bcz you are the god of mobile. Your review helps a lot
The Humble Bao	So MKBHD, a review on Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 coming anytime soon?
Johnathan Griffith	Love your new video ratio, please keep it like this
akshay kumar	4:57 eminem fan
salvador r	Mocked apple then followed their notch and no headphone jack trend :/
kaustubh paliwal	Hey Marcus iPhone XR Redüõëüõë
Nathaniel Allen	Honestly prefer the curved front-facing camera over the essential phone. It was too obviously cut out and this one looks organically connected
Bondan Rahadian	This doesn't look like much of an upgrade from the 6. What happened to the "Flagship Killer" thing that OnePlus had going on.  For the same price, I could get a Mi Mix 3 that has no notch, same specs, better cameras (probably), and a wireless charger that comes in the box.  Step up your game OnePlus
Akshay Patel	In this price LG G7 Thinq is best. In oneplus 6T there is no wireless charging no ip68 water resistance no 32bit hifi dac audio no boom box speaker no QuadHD+ resolution display no 1000nits bright display no MIL 810G body.And LG gives second year warrenty. People are attract from advertising of oneplus.
Mbonea Mjema	Love the video editing and video quality is on point
Kumar Band	wallpaper link please!!!
Sidharth R	Why no one reviews Sony phones.. are they dead???
Ujjwal Pawar	7:57 mantra = formula (for those who don't know hindi or sanskrit)
B Smoove	No headphone jack boo... I'll stick with my OnePlus 6 until the LG V40 goes down in price
Manohar singh	they smashed apple and samyung with that price and performance. Good to see a brand asking fair price.
Azhar Hussain	watching this video on my Oneplus One :'(
Luka Pesic	What is that weather app?
Caiden Schwab	So I'm in a predicament deciding between the Pixel 3 XL, Iphone X, and OnePlus6t.  Iphone has apple care and imessages and optimized apps. But is pricey.  Pixel 3xl has bare bones android with the newest updates. But only 4gb of ram OnePlus6t is 579 for the specs I want and has all the essentials.   Which do I buy?
Roslain Rolf	This phone looks amazing it's nice
Lahm Salleh	Glad i have my op6 the jack still there but the 6t is nice too. Fair new phone for 1+ users üëç
Amer Ha	Does it work with at&t?
Stanley jean-baptiste	I'm not changing from my pixel XL 2 this year, I'm.waiting for the next season of phones but if I were to make a decision today this would be probably my number 1 choice despite the camera not being as good as my phone, Google can ( and should) learn alot from oneplus, I like the pixel XL 3 but this one is definitely a better value for the same amazing performance, minus Google's software dark magic lol
shubham gain	I need that wallpaper
–°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –ë–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤	Higher capacity of battery is good, But.. 3.5 Jack, Oh Noüò≠üò≠ I'd  prefer the larger phone phone than listen music with Type-C adaptor
Rajin Bhattal	Was the headphone jack adapter shown included with the 6t? I use BT for my headphones, but in my '08 car I need the aux...
I Do Music	The best thing about this new release is the older and better phone is now  less expensive lol
Reee Eee	*WELL, THATS JUST NIT PICKY*
Amit kumar	Funny how companies mock other companies for doing something, and then do the same thing themselves
Virdi 22	Subtle Eminem shoutout
odesource14	Where can I find the wallpapers you're using ? Thx
M_U_M_M_Y	Are they still doing the fake "invitation-only" BS sales tactics?
yogesh S	Which wallpaper you use brw ? Link ?
Aryan Pandey	Well Samsung galaxy note 9 has 4000mah battery less bezels and still has the room for the Headphone jack. Maybe oneplus is joining the no Headphone jack trend ???
Govind Kumawat	Rip to OnePlus 6 users üòÇüòÇ‚ö∞
TheRedDaren	Oxygen OS is the dope though. It's so lightweight and bloat-free, I don't wanna leave the OnePlus line.
anton claeys	please don't refer to the notch size as "notch volume". It is two-dimensional so it's a surface (m^2), not a volume (m^3). Notch surface
Le Nounours	Who remember all the hype the OnePlus One has ? Man I miss this golden era of smartphones
Sooka Beliyat	No space? The note 9 has a 4000mAH battery, headphone jack... And manage to shove a whole stylus... A WHOLE FUCKING STYLUS in their phone!  I smell bull
TheWebaa	I decided to get the Pixel 3 this year. I just didn't want to mess with the new fingerprint reader. I also wanted to try out several of the pros of Pixel phones. Maybe I'll move back to OnePlus in the future.
Procurement	I like to keep down on electronic waste and save money until there's a real reason to upgrade. Still not nearly enough to make me want to upgrade from my OnePlus3.
ackthbbft	I wish this phone was compatible with Project Fi.
Savvy Dude	I'm not even hyped..
trajetszcka	Aynƒ± fiyat? :O
Richard Major	It‚Äôs coming to basically all the carriers in the UK too
Bob Walker	I've got sick of Oneplus's price hikes over the years and spent 4 days talking myself into the Mi mix 3 . Now they bump the spec and hold the price? I'm back on the fence again. <sighs>
Lewis Busch-Vogel	Finally a design that doesn‚Äôt copy Apple lmao
k k	I'll prefer the normal fingerprint scanner.
Ibrahim El-Rafie	Definitely switching my s8 for it
Rowan McWilliams	Very frustrated by the lack of headphone jack, was planning on upgrading from my 5 to a new one plus at some point but I guess I'd better take a look at LG
Sahkil Khan	You give me one phone
Simocosimo	I don't have the little white button in the bottom of the screen on my OP6. Is this something just for the 6T?
David Lund	Nice Casey shirt
faiyaz makrani	Oneplus 6t it not worthy upgrade who use oneplus 6.
Zi Ye	Nice shot with the 6666 poker cards
TommyThousandFaces	Why those corners are so much rounded? I don't really like this trend of curved corners that really cut off a lot of the screen. Also what's wrong with those new navigation buttons that space the dock on the homescreen making the tall display useless... Other than that (and the headphone jack gone, of course) looks like a great phone.
Nigel Thompson	Hey I have been waiting for the phone for a while now but just one thing holding me back from going for it and buying it is the Snapchat quality as funny as that sounds. Anyway you can saw how it compares to other android phones and even iPhones?
greengonzonz	Until now I've felt pretty "Meh" about 1+. But this version.... I like it alot
Prudhvi teja	R.I.P HEADPHONE JACK!!  R.I.P  ONEPLUS  6T!!!
Guren San	Love you! Keep up the good work!
Dorian Fielder	I've been having the pixel 2xl for year now. I was going to upgrade to the pixel 3xl just because of the camera google does is legit...I feel like pricing for the pixel is just way to high for only 4gb of ram in a phone...don't get me wrong Google does a great job in the software dept but price is key and the pixel is too expensive for what you're not getting...plus I work at TMobile Soo I feel like I'm a get a better deal
TheSimon253	No 3.5mm is a dealbreaker for me.
809 Blanco	Kamikaze playing on Spotify. I'm sold. üòé
Brandon Stafford	I'm still rocking the OnePlus 3T and it hasn't slowed down a bit!
Bruno Pedro	Nope.
Victor Wuyts	Still rocking the OnePlus One. Im not experienced with their new phones, but the build quality is there!
Mikazita	No jack? Samsung it is
digvijay powar	I am still using op5 and it still fast and smooth and even i don't think I have to upgrade for 6T cause it's not that big difference expect screen size üòú the camera has no big difference my op5 still captures pretty amazing pictures
Tibs 26	This is definitely not my phone. Don't like the look.
Huzeifa yahya	Would love the red iPhone XR
kyky iopte	no LED notification light in 6T ???
Andrew Fish	Did the speaker get any better ?  Before it was released I told me self if it had a better speaker if upgrade doesn't look like that happened though .
Ajnart	No super Vooc ? :'(
Muhammad Mateen	xiaomi mi mix 3 is beast

Akshay Agarwal	Oneplus forever!!...I have been using oneplus from oneplus one sadly got theft. Then bought oneplus 2 when launched. I have been using it till now from the day one I have bought in same way. Still running strong.
Scott	Didn‚Äôt Apple claim that it was too hard to integrate a fingerprint scanner behind a screen and that‚Äôs why they went with FaceID? Or did they mean it was too hard to build in a scanner that met their security requirements?
Max Ols√©n	I used to hate Samsung phone.. Now I love them..   Why?   No Notch, and Audio Jack <3
XgamerdaveX	Notch = no sale

Nick Frangoff	the cards arranged in the right corner all 6's, you are really taking it to the next level with the details
Video Vibes	does it have a notification light?
Danish	6T is just bigger battery and a weird notch on top of 6. Happy with my 6 and 3T.
M. Hamiz	This year best smartphone was Huawei Mate 20 Pro no more Oneplus
Mandragoras	I am definitely buying it! I was waiting for Google pixel 3 but I am not that impressed by the specs and the huge notch+the price is quite high. Why not Oneplus 6t?! My next phone, surely!
Anirban Roy Talukder	Am I the only one who notice the playing cards(6)  in this video and (10) in iPhone XR video??  If I am the only one , i should deserve a free phone!!

AFTERSHOCK 7582	Looks good
POWELLIII	Like Mate 20 non pro version better... Mate series still have best battery life üí™üèæ
Tech guy	Price is good but at the same time that's all they would ask for a phone with Snapdragon 845 at this late in 2018.
L3ON	Watching this on my OP6. Going to wait for the 7.
Michelangelo Fantasia	Currently on my OnePlus 5t and probably until the 7t comes out.

Sufyan Tsauri	Damn the fingerprint animation looks ugly üòê

dr Ronnie	Watching this video on my Samsung microwave with extra noisy buttons
Taofiki Gafar-Schaner	Companies have been promising large battery if they remove headphone jack. One plus did so. So can't hate them too much. Mi Mix 3 is a better deal but getting 300 off from TMobile is a killer deal
LiM3xD	U forgot to mention Gorilla glass 6?
lemeDmeme	Which would people say is better, midnight black or mirror black? Not about looks but more about the durability, I'll more than likely slap a case or a skin on but you never know when you'll go raw with it
Esteban Amaya	I wouldn't mind a slightly thicker phone for the headphone jack
Adnan Ahmed	Not a fan of black bars in the video though. Is it because of a different aspect ratio?
Farhan Khan	I think display fingerprint not much better,quickly not unlocked ...
Anandh SM	Which is better in 35k+ range:pixel 2 or OnePlus 6T??
Grave Soldier	Closed the video as soon as he mentioned there's no headphone jack!
ISiupick	I'm hyped for the new in-screen fingerprint reader, but no headphone jack hurts me a lot.
Sniper X	"NEVER SETTLE"         ...no headphone jack
Franky G	I have to sacrifice the headphone jack for a cleaner version of Android software and excess memory. My LG v20 has ensured that I will not stray far from pure Android ever again.

RedfooMC	0:43 fdid he swear or I didn't hear it right
doncsicso81	Now I'm praying Samsung will keep the jack in the S10... that would make it my phone for the next 3 years at least
Nagendra Rao	Hay its teardrop notch, not deadbolt notch like essential phone.
Dibbendu Koley	This phone looks so good
Amitesh Pramanik	I love physical fingerprint sensor. Indisplay sensor will take time to be perfect but until then i am happy with sensor at the back(not a fan of half baked tech in a hi-tech phone)
Dan	I definitely appreciate the upgrades and price point but the loss of a headphone jack is a compromise I'm not yet willing to make.
MTW Tech	2min silence üîá for the 'jack'

DinoAWD	STOP RECORDING IN 18:9, WE WANT 18.5:9 FOR NOTE 8
Akram Hussaini	I don't know but one plus 6 design look more awsm than 6t. The only good things about 6t is battery and notch.
sparsh gupta	OnePlus really disappointed this time
g1598	Apple in 2020, " we have reimagined how to unlock your phone and innovated the way how you do it, by placing the finger print reader under the screen." - apple Fanboys will lap it up

Harley Quimm	The camera's trash if we're keeping it a buck here. Don't get me wrong, the phone's great, everything about it is impressive, even without the headphone jack. But I don't see it as an upgrade to a $300 Pocophone F1
Oisho Tamam	I kinda directly gave up on it after hearing that it doesn't have a headphone jack
Aaron Wong	The first review I came to
Edis Delgado	Thanks Samsung for still having the headphone jack!
Jared Gott	Guys if you don't care about the headphone jack, that is fine. But don't trash us for wanting it.
Alex Lushiku	And OnePlus is also getting out of the picture without the notch
Jorge Daniel	Finally a phone I feel like it's worth upgrading to. I'll miss the headphone jack, but I knew this day was coming, and I've already bought Bluetooth headphones

Sayan Jackson	wait for few more months for oneplus 7 its gonna be 5G
Fevves	If I understood correctly, this phone is not having the rgb led notification light on the front? If so  and aside the lack of  audio jack, this should not be happening. Redo the phone with O+7 and include the good features back again.
Baxtexx	I'll stick with the 6, bought it two weeks ago when I heard this wasn't going to have a 3.5mm jack.
AchillesNYC	Nice try one plus. This phone is DOA
Bipin Dixit	The details and color in your videos is best among all these Youtubers. Watch it at 1080p guys you'll love it
yuvraj mehra	You forgot to mention Gorilla Glass 6 they're using
Girish Radhakrishnan	Please no more wide screen video, 16:9 is fine for 2018,2019.

Mr.Magnificent	Is it possible to get analouge audio via usb-c like with huawai?
Luisk	HOLD ON. WAIT A MINUTE. ONEPLUS COMING TO T-MOBILE?! I GUESS ILL SETTLE FOR NO HEADPHONE JACK.
Jypae	Why do the phones have to get bigger still. All I could think of, while watching this, was how about something like an iPhone SE2 with all the bells and whistles, all screen and no physical button in front. Could be an android for all I care. I won't belive there wouldn't be a market for smaller phone with all the goodies.
Basantdeep Singh	RIP APPLE
Nick Partridge	The question for me is should I keep my Google Pixel 2 XL or switch to this phone???
Christopher Hernandez	It's crazy how Essential was so ahead design wise. It's like like phones are barely getting there. I was scared this phone might give me buyer's remorse on my iPhone XR but I think I'm good.

Manousos Anapliotis	Bought about 2 weeks ago the OnePlus 6 Avengers Edition. Super happy with it (coming from iPhone 8 Plus) I also love my headphone jack, 6T is amazing as well but the 6 is the one I choose obviously plus the version I have is a bit more special and rare.
Vaibhav Hireraddi	waiting for oneplus 6t giveaway
David Stone	The Verizon compatibility has stopped me from buying a OnePlus..... Until now.
jubitolik	Is there going to be any price drops for one plus 6? I hope so..
ub umer	I really want to buy this one but I am still not ready to let go of headphone jack :(
Steve	Wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw a grand piano. One handed. X
RebasUno	Loving the new look, the White T-shirt... Looks damn fresh
mix1608	says this video requires payment to watch?
topgeartim	I am thoroughly surprised that the notch has become mainstream. I absolutely hate the notch and when it was first introduced for the iPhone 10 I didn‚Äôt think it was gonna catch on. Very disappointed in other manufacturers that followed the design. As a side note, I love the headphone jack. But I‚Äôd rather have no notch and no headphone jack than have jack with a notch.
Martin Fehringer	"A moment of silence for its loss"  **keeps talking**
Trevor Brough	YouTube says this video required payment to watch... Where do I pay? I don't see the option anywhere
Jun San	no headphone jack.  no thank you. simple.

Nischay Jain	Headphone jack ü§ê
Fernando Gomez	No wireless charging ... That something I cant give up
Uday Sengupta	Still not upgrading from my op5t..the fingerprint scanner at the back is so useful, can take pics,drag down notification panel etc,
the fox	Hope my htc 10 dies soon! For me its probebly one of the best looking phones right now... Would buy it
Ash Menon	RIP THE JACK RIP the headphone jack, and Jack the Ripper.  I like it.
Robert Smit	Great price, but no wireless charging is a deal breaker for me. Trying to get rid of those cables. I don't mind losing the headphone jack. Using wireless headsets for some time. Great for working out and not getting tangled up with wires.
Rashvit Patel	always on point
Karam Alboni	He listens to eminem üòÄüòÄ that makes me happy
Reagan Littlewood	I just got an XS Max as my old Oneplus's USB C port died. Was kinda dreading seeing this phone as i thought i'd regret my purchase... I don't. It's literally half the price with double the storage, but it's not the amazing 'Flagship Killer' it used to be; It's a slightly cut down flagship with a slightly cut down cost. Then again, i'm happy with Face ID, I use streaming for all my music and i think the notch on the iPhone looks better (i know it's bigger but it's a more pleasing shape, plus you literally don't notice it when using the phone).
Vedant Gupta	Wallpaper?

Felix Rivera Gomez	Awesome. I'm a big OP fan. But I have a question. Like many or majority of other phones, what earphones does it bring, if any. Because I remember buying my OP 3T and I had to buy the ear buds apart. Is the standard earhones wireless or not? And keep up the good work üëçüëÜ
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE	Good thing I'm on T-Mobile
Chris Lundin	So, I recently purchased the Samsung S9+ and have until Friday to return it with a restocking fee to Best Buy... I got it paid down (with trade in of $300 from my iPhone 7) to around $450 over 24 monhs. The only issue is that that money would come back to me on a best buy gift card and around $175 in cash. Would it be worthwhile in anyone's opinion to return this and get the 6t now that I can actually use it on Verizon, or should I just wait until the 7 or 7t? Full disclosure, I do really appreciate the wireless charging aspect of this phone and bummed that OnePlus didn't include it on their new variant. Help people!

potatopotatopotato	still on the OP3t, hopefully the OP7 will have a headphone jack
JYT96	The only reason i m not getting it is because no headphone jack, i had the one and now using the 3 since it came out, was excited for this one, but no jack is a no-go for me. I can get over the stupid notch but you can t make fun of apple and then copy them. Hope the new oneplus (8?) has is, if not i guess i m  switching to huawei or something

yassir yassir	Nice
Urmo Luts	I skip 6t, because i have 6 and it is almost same good. I hope they but headphone jack back because good bluetooth headphones does last enoug. most time bt headphones power ends when you are running or working because you miss charge :D
Kelvin_396	I'll be trading in my iPhone 8+, first thing Thursday morning when T-Mobile opens up. I bought the I phone in hopes that I would like it , but hate it, my friend has the One Plus 6 , and let me play around with it and I was so impressed, I've always been more of a fan for Android and I'm going back Thursday with the One Plus 9+.
kvrreddy1605	Mayday mayday, 3.5mm jack missing, last seen on OP device, oops, on a Samsung flagship.
Naveed Beigh	What if we apply a tempered glass or a screen protector? Will the fingerprint sensor still work ?
Tanjim The Tech Guy	Dope üî•
Zack Abnet	The camera, the fucking camera, every year its the one thing they dont go deep on and this year its the reason im finally moving on to a Pixle.   Funny thing and it might be just  a coincidence but my one plus 5 shut off at midnight the 28th and hasnt worked since, but jokes on one plus as im getting a pixle

electribemc	Another mobile phone released. Another headphone jack deceased
[ Gaming Inconsistently ]	A software update in the future to light up the phone screen only under your finger to see your fingerprint(if it's doable) would be cool
taciomaldito	I'm not into notches but i'd prefer the regular notch more than this tear drop notch, it really is unsettling
Vikram Ganapathineedi	I used the Oneplus2 and now using the Oneplus6, I really like the led notification. Sad they removed it.
Miguel Andres Contreras Alma	I dont know why the headphone jack bothers people. It must be there for people like me, who just dont want to stick an extra cable to plug another cable. I dont like bluetooth devices because you lose sound quality so, between wired and bluetooth personaly, I stick to my cable, so the best thing for me is to keep working on those jacks.
SoLoM	Am i the only one in the universe who hate every single notch in the world? They really piss me off I don‚Äôt know why
Fayyu Badat	i wish one plus make a one plus watch like iPhone make for their own phone
Annie Mous	The "notch" looks more like a Widow's Peak!
Dom Joel	Is it worth upgrading from a 5t to the 6t?
ThirdEye Clarity	T-mobile is doing an offer and I can trade in my Nexus 6 and get $300 off. That's crazy because it's 4 years old. I might have to do it.
jpullen581	So... didn't even give a moment of silence for the loss of the headphone jack. :-P   Sounds like you're not missing it.
Joseph Stephens	Do you normally promote Dbrand because they sponsor you or would you actually recommend the skins if they didn't pay you for promotions?
Sandip Shaw	At least provide an adapter with two ports (charger and headphone)
cofffee cloud	I don't  need any new phone why am i watching  these  videos
Believe In it	Thank you for filming in the right dimensions for my phone
michael duncan	They should have left the headphone jack on the phone. Sounds like Samsung and LG are the only ones left doing so. It's a shame they have to let such an awesome thing go in order to accommodate a fingerprint sensor which I'll never use. They all must like listening to transistor radios, I'm referring to the manufacturers LOl. Yes I know you can still listen to wired headphones with their little dongle thingy, but you sure can't listen to wired headphones and charge the phone at the same time. What a shame.
ironshark123	Did anyone get witches love advertisement? üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Paryagdeep Singh	Samsung puts a 4000 mAh battery with a s-pen while still keeping the headphone jack . What a stupid reason to remove the headphone jack
john Smith	RIP The Jacker
Anmol Thakur	no headphone jack ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Med Msd	:( i would buy it if it has normal finger print reader
PRATEEK DUTT	6 is better than 6t
PROANISH	This is my only thing I‚Äôd like to state. I love how that finger print reader is under the screen, but see this is where people will attack me for saying this. Eventually if apple does decide to use that tech in the iPhone they will wait around maybe 4 years so all these little things that are kinda small but still an inconvenience will go away and the tech will be there to support it. But everyone will say apple is copying and cant do anything new. From my perspective this is some dope ass tech but I can‚Äôt wait till apple adopts it and we see a different side of it, maybe apple will make the entire screen the reader so you can place your finger any where you want.
Shahzaib Aziz	Definitely going to buy 6t
bigavelik	Hi Marques...I love the T Shirt, where did you shop it? Regards from France.
Harry Booth	I love the 2:1 ratio!
Modern	Is it such a bad thing to make a phone thicker? Then you'd be able to fit everything you want to make it perfect? Enough space for a battery and headphone jack. Also, they could of gotten rid of the second camera if they needed room for the headphone jack maybe?
AMG	Dear Samsung, please do not axe the jack. Please.
iiamC√Ä≈Å∆èB S.R	Wallpaper link, please.
lolzman122	Mehh I actually prefer the op6 since it has a headphone jack and I use it pretty much all the time
Tauheed Rahman	hey Marques !!! There's a phone called Asus Zenfone 5Z . Why people are not talking about it. Its in some aspects better than one plus if not better.
Khalid Ahmed	I wonder why am watching this since i can't afford it except in my dreams üòîüòî
Alexander Ott	Ok, this is a really small notch
2PercentSkimMilk	I was really wanting to get this until you said there was no headphone jack. Disappointing.
OverclockZoneTV	with on-screen fingerprint scanner, can you just tap on it to unlock the phone while the screen is off or do you have to turn on the screen by pressing power button first?
Suyeb Shaikh	Bow that is one superb Notch Phoneüòç
Somu Meher	I already own a oneplus 6 and I dont think 6t is worth upgrading. Reasons- fingerprint is alow and unreliable, same camera, and no headphone jack which is the most important thing for me....üòë
Gouk Wapanzy	This video requires payment to watch, WTF? MKBHD has gone full-on capitalist on us?
Rishi Hapawat	Why noooo headphone jack, Samsung gets my respect.
Rohil Pathak	You literally titled this video saying it's the "same price" when it's not. The OP 6 launched at $529 while this is $549.
Siddharth Joshi	Watching this on my new onePlus 6T bought right now.
Mia zuki	I got the OnePlus 6 a while ago so all I'm missing here is a slightly bigger battery and screen but in return I get too keep the finger print scanner in my favorite location and the headphonejack.. okay I'm still pretty happy with the oneplus 6 was worried the 6t will make me regret not waiting
Fernando Gandara	Sold review.

Kunal Aggarwal	This one is for those who scrolled down to the comments to watch someone comment about watching MKBHD's movement reflection for the subtle transition at 1:08 :D
I Finn	Best notch implementation.
Flesh EU	If one plus had to get rid of the headphone Jack because of getting a bigger battery and in display fingerprint reader then im scared that this Will also happen to the Samsung Galaxy S10 since I imagine it is getting a bigger battery and also a in display fingerprint reader.
lvlaple4Ever	Same price my ass nigga
Dinese K	Mmm dongles
IAMDISSAPOINT	I'm sure the dissapearance of the 3.5mm jack has NOTHING to do with Oneplus trying to sell their bullets headphones.. ü§îü§îü§î

Perennial Rhinitis	If they had the same camera setup, I'm just gonna wait for the o+ 7 or whatever is next. I'm not a selfie person, but I love taking outdoor and food photos. I hope they improve their cameras because I really just can't deal with a heavy UI like Samsung's and the Pixels are not available in my country.
Chrysostomos Papademetriou	2:24 actually I prefer the OnePlus 6T notch much more !! The other phone's notch is too annoying
JasperEdits	Just... that fingerprint animation... oh my god... my eyes are bleeding.
Tom Alawatte	Oneplus 6's starting price was $529, this phone is $20 more $549. Why did you keep saying "same price same price" ???          1+6   $529     Vs     1+6T   $549

Dangerous Time	El
spider7ven	Fingerprint sensor at the back and a headphone jack still rocks. Notch does not do much. OP6t did exactly what i didn't want and didn't do what I wanted. Bummer!  But that's just my personal preference. Like i said "want".
metrotorful	No Jack No Buy
Robert Gitata	Though I know its highly unlikely, Oneplus should find the space and the minituarized technology to give us back the headphone jack in the Oneplus 7. I mean I dont expect Apple to do it they just made Oneplus move there event but Oneplus if possible do something.
Phenomenal Concepts	What happened to Kira?
Joey O'Brien	Are you wearing a Casey Neistat tshirt in this video?

Sreeraj P	Vivo Nex has a In Display FP Scanner and a larger 4000 mAh battery.... still, they have space for headphone jack....  And... OP6T doesn't.... why?!!  It's just following the trend... and.... Oneplus team told somewhere that lots of their users are using wireless heaphones so that they're going for no headphone jack... or something like that....   And.... one more thing.... it's NEVER SETTLE... and... you can't charge your phone while listening to music.... üòÇ

Yohenny Sabrina Castro	the improvement are great!!
thanglong pham	this beat the shit out of iphone
Arunabh Mishra	Pressing the power key and then the finger print reader. That's deal breaker for me!
FaerieDust	Ngl, I kind of laughed a bit at the six hours of screen on time. I know my Xiaomi Mi Max 3 isn't all that when it comes to specs, but I consistently get between 20.5 to 21 hours of SOT. I just can't imagine going back to "normal" battery phones...

manman464	They said a better camera
Cody Allen	I've really liked what One Plus is all about. If they implement wireless charging I may have to move over in the future. But without wireless charging it's a no go for me. But keep up the good work One Plus üëç
Oliver Harding	forgot mute switch
The Applecolipse	teardrop notch design is the most elegant execution of the notch it feels more like a design rather than a poor attempt to increase screen real estate by all means necessary. the nitpick about the fingerprint sensor kinda makes no sense either way if you gonna unlock your phone at night the screen is going shine to your face anyway after unlocking the phone even if it doesnt do so at full brightness
Dmitri Weissman	no Android One is the reason I'm not going to buy it. Love it in any other way
Prasad Kamat	Wish they made a smaller version... Would love a pixel 3 sized one plus !!

Tmac Tmac	Here's an important question: Do you have to wake the screen first by pressing the power button, then press the screen to read your fingerprint OR can you just put your finger on the screen to wake it and read your fingerprint at the same time? Having to press twice (the first option) is lame.

Sandy McLean	Hey Marques, great video review this is my next phone!!
Guessers12	Honestly, I dont get why people complain about the headphone jack. You can get bluetooth buds and headphones for literally the same price as wired ones nowerdays, and they're of much better quality sound wise. I made the switch to bluetooth a while ago, and haven't even thought of looking back. Literally, more pros than cons. I personally would lose the jack for a better battery any day of the week :)
Damope	Has the haptic feedback system been improved on?
Enteraname	No headphone jack, no thanks
Brownie8986	Man! I wish their 256 8gb one came in mirror black üòçüòçüòç But for the price this is pretty awesome!
dhns555	I‚Äòd buy it if it had a better camera, I‚Äòd pay even 100$ more
Phalaax Izmeil	You don‚Äôt sound that impressive! Coz it‚Äôs not apple or samsung? Cut the bullshit. This is the best phone ever in the market as of now.
Thomas Booth	Good job on recording this in 18:9!
subit crestha	No jack??????? One plus is no more my favorite now.... R.I.P jack
M to the B	I'd absolutely love this phone in a comfy 5.5 inches! 6.4 is just too big for my hands, the normal Pixel 3 has a great size, but it's too expensive and not worth the money for me, as I am not that huge of a camera person.
nco405	Finally a sexy notch. Classy, design, and not akward looking. Honestly, the overall upgrades, just wow. I'm a owner of the 5T, at first a good phone, but when it's your daily driver, you get to see the short corner that one plus take. I wouldn't go again for oneplus. But know, seeing that one............ Arrrg. Oneplus is back in my mind. Well played.  The only downside is the headphone jack. Yes everyone has Bluetooth. But that jack is there when you need it. It's tiny details that you don't pay attention when you have it but makes a  difference when they are removed and you need it
christopher graziano	this is exactly what I was hoping for. Amazing phone great specs and actually implementing new features to actually move it forward and not charging more. and now its finally getting carrier reckognition is a bold statement to those that come out 900+
Alex K	im not trying to fanboy but the screen to body aspect ratio is really stunning on oneplus phones lately

amombi florence	Kamakaze
arawtgabi	I have the iPhoneSE and looking for a replacement.  Looks like I found my replacement.  I can't afford the 1 grand phones.  Now that TMobile has it, I can do the payment option.
Raziah Aysam	Happy OP3T user here; I'm tempted to upgrade this time.
Logan Starke	Dude nice shirt
Abdullah Khan	*just kind of annoying*
Benjamin Martindale	I just switched to tmobile and i am going to buy it when i see it in stores or on website. I currently use an iphone 6s and im lowkey tired of the apple ecosystem also this phone is pretty cheap so next year i can a new one.
Nick Garlick	Looks like a cool phone
Vivek Hegde	You need to press the power button every time in order to wake up the screen, before using on screen fingerprint reader?
Mathieu Constant	Yes yes yes and YESSS
Adhi Narayanan Y R	Last time when I got OnePlus it was back in 2016 and the phone was OnePlus 3. When 3T came out, I felt like I was cheated by OnePlus by releasing another phone with something better. Now i'm gonna get 6T. Can't wait for it
Sam Kam	Eminem ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Craig Ippolito	Good review man. Yes this will be an addition to my device portfolio. I have the 6 and since TMO will have the T variant I'll grab one there. Quite excited to see and feel the updates.
Haaroon	So, OnePlus also decided to kill Jack!!
Pamela Ramdat	My dad has a 3T and is upgrading to the 6T, i personally i am going from the s8+ to an iPhone xs Max
Von Royale	Really nice phone for a good price nut I'm waiting for the best Samsung Galaxy S10+
gokul vp	Samsung fans hit like
anshul ahuja	thats the difference between apple and other companies...apple takes time to perfect the feature and new tech...other companies just rush to show off new features
David Pauls	If it was sold by carriers in Canada then I would definitely get it
Vladim√≠r Pt√°ƒçek	I'm really interested in finger print unlock as you haven't mentioned (or I just missed this info) if it's necessary to push pwr button first every time...  If it is necessary, I just can't see the point in it because, then I can use the face unlock...
Muhammad Ally	Nice Casey Nesistat shirt.üëåüèº
Law Room	if i had the money i would buy it without any objection  its really a great phone i spend a lot of my time watching videos about phones, how they work, how you van make thm better etc. and im trying to improve myself and get more knowledge

Hitesh Ghadigaonkar	what about WARP CHARGE?
Raiderx	Really blows they got rid of the headphone jack, but at least they offer Type C headphone and wireless headphones which are not price outrageously
Raj Saroj	Oct 25 bro seriously ???
Chris Burrow	6t or 6? I'm stuck between them.
John Voss	The horrible service given under warranty for my OP5 in India is the only thing that stopped me from ordering this.
Miguel Fuentes	Without turning on the display, does the fingerprint scanner work? Or you have to turn it on before it's available to scan?
Hubert Kula	Why don't they make a phone with both rear and underglass fingerprint reader
kid orange	someone please gift me
Cola Shooter	Waiting for OnePlus7 :D next year
sud9 vlogs	*Casey tshirt*
Dane Tadsen	Thank God VZ comparability!! Finaly
Kimo	Pls send link of your shirt
Rand0mTV	I don't like the notch trend at all, but this one is really sleek.
Brian Philip	Being completely honest, I don't think the in-screen fingerprint reader is an improvement, neither is the no-headphone-jack
Piyush Parmar	I don't like this 6 months T's phone cycle. this step is more technology backwards for users than it's forward for OnePlus.  They want give you features that should be on a year cycle and these 6T users and those OP6 users will left behind by next release. Bcoz OP6 users should have all these 6T features plus few moreover. Now OP7 may be option for 5T users.  PS: it's very sad for users.
aravind dx	Can u review asus 5z..
Arseniy	this is the first sexy notch on any phone. I am an apple guy and unfortunately since no other phone works with the apple watch i'm going to go with the iphone Xs but THIS is doing the notch right!
Munawar Salim	My next phone will be OnePlus 7
Joey Laxson	IM GETTING IT
Nethermir	Hahahaha RIP headphone jack.
Dantedijon1	Ima get my friend the oneplus 6T for his birthday
MrToughEnough	Mate Pro 20 is easily the best phone of the year.  Shame that MBKHD can't try it and we can :p
LYF hAXx	Being a developer I keep both android and iOS phones ,for android I use one plus but I have started to hate the company .it's such a bad strategy to launch a better phone within same price point just after a few months,i bought one plus 6 when it got launched and now 6t is here .I am niw thinking whats the point of getting one plus6 when we know a better phone with same price is going to launch soon,not going to doo the same mistake next year. This strategy sucks ONE PLUS IT SUCKS....
Tamara Girodie	FINALLY VERIZON COMPATIBILITY
Victor_H	Nokia has headphone jack also

Fred Lime	Watching this from my OnePlus 10T

Matthew Widmeyer	grandpa, where were you the day headphone jacks died?
Meseiro	Screw the under display fingerprint, give me my headphone jack back!
Philip Alexander Hassialis	So now we have to wait for Strange Parts to drill it a headphone jack back in :P
Chillout	I wish they would be more honest like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your reason for removing the headphone jack?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell everyone else is doing it, so we did it too‚Äù

Deepak Yadav	So now it's the time to mock one plus for 3.5mm jack coz last time they had mocked Apple for the same thing ü§°ü§°
David Hammer	Thx for being objective and pointing out what's wrong even though the hard childish OnePlus fans will get angry coz honesty harms the weaks !  Marques President ! üòâ Peace mate
Anton Kress	No 2:1 ratio this time around?
Mohamed Orayith	Any expert who could tell me how much the one plus 6 price drop, U.K.????  Thank youuuuu
opio11	How about the new  full screen gestures?
arelius1971	Excellent review, I'm getting my son this phone. I love your work, CARRY ON !!!!!!
Vatsalya Verma	Hi Marques...!!! Love you brother. Just one thing.....please also attach the link for the wallpapers you use in your videos (phone + pc) from next time onward. That would help many in easily downloading them rather than searching for them here and there. Love from INDIA <3. Peace.
Patrick R	Notch is a notch no matter how you twist it. And no notification light and no headphone jack. Yep oneplus settled.
PCuenca	You forgot to mention about the improved gesture navigation! Great video anyway
Eduardo Pereira Alves	I have a 3T and I'm willing to buy the 6T.
Abbas Haidari	But unlocking the phone will become a two step process.. First press the lock button and then the fingerprint.. That's really inconvenient..
Born Cynic	They just took the oneplus 6 and designed it like it's sister Oppo f9 pro. *YAWN!
The Lord Tachankas Belly Button	This vs s9?
Greg McCallum	So it doesn‚Äôt have a notification light??
Nasr Anaizi	No water proofing?
Kenroy Tucker	Need a proper mate 20 pro review. It would be nice to compare the 1+ with it.
Tareq Quddus	I don't get the point of on display fingerprint scanner.. There are lot of space left in the back. Headphone jack was a necessity.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart	Pff... The world changes too fast. I don't need that kind of stuff.
karthik arumugam	Twice storage... Who cares... Need the jack
Yawar Wani	I'm glad I did not wait for it .  One Plus 6 is great .
Colin de Deugd	Soo, Pixel 3 (XL) or OnePlus 6t?
Jerry Tan	Watching on Oneplus 3t
F0RGOTTN	the thing that i don't understand, it launched today, and you said multiple times you have been using it for the past days? unless they invited you, it makes me wonder
safi khan	Though im not OP 6 user but why they make "T" version phones. They could have release their 1 flagship phone with top tear specs a year. Doesn't make any sense to buy 6T over 6.
Thunderhawk51	Notch is a notch no matter how you look at it and it's ugly. No deal. I can take 1cm top and bottom bezels but not a notch or camera cut out of any kind. Too bad, it's a good phone otherwise. And that missing headphone jack of course. Not enough space is bs, but idc anymore. I'll stick with my Mate 9 for now. Waiting to see what Samsung can offer in the future.
Halwest Noraden	Ok marques we get it, you have a big dick. You don't have to shove it down our throats every phone reviewüòÇ
Dub Monster	This phone is one i could even get next year. It's bit too pricey now for my budget
Riyaadh Fakier	Remind me again why I need to buy a $1000 iPhone??

rakshith Gowda	Watching in OnePlus 6 üòÇ
Satish	How is the night mode shots taken on oneplus 6t?
Ruhul Choudory	Having been part of the OnePlus hype since the days of invite only purchase, I have today made the decision to go elsewhere... Seems like they don't listen to their users anymore. Every forum, every comments section on YouTube videos, fans have been screaming their heads off at the loss of the jack and in return all we got was a measly 300-400 mAh of extra juice in return. Would've been fine if OnePlus announced a 5000mah battery, I'd happily lose the jack over that.... For me OnePlus has 'Finally Settled' and is no longer a flagship killing brand. What a disappointment.
Malcolm James	1+ 6T or 3XL? What is your recommendation?
Nur Akmal Afif	Watching this from my legendary OnePlus One.
Vaisakh Nair	Not  having a jack is where i draw the line
Tian Ouyang	Oh this is so my next phone. And the fact that I can trade in my OnePlus 3T and get a $300 off just seals the deal once and for all.
Mehmet ≈ûen	Hey Marques! i hate 18:9 ...2:1... We have able to choose the ratio
Bob Barnett	While Apple perfects a 3-d pile of shit that that talks üí© OnePlus has a tiny notch and underscreen fingerprint sensor and better battery
Ghani Chishty	Been waiting for the review since the launch event... 1st one among LTT, Unbox T., J. Morrison! Cool...  And really the headphone jack... =((( SUUUPER bummer!
Cosmin Andrei	Boring review
Ranjith kumar	They were endorsing your review on 1+ 6 during the live event!
sean fl	Is the plus the biggest version?? Or is there a bigger version?
Romeo Badulkhan	Nice tshirt where can i buy one ?
Divyesh Bhavani	No. Im happy with my galaxy note 9
F C	Can't wait for OnePlus to show up at carrier stores like T-Mobile. I bet they'll offer good deals to get their name out there
simppeli92	I feel that if it still had the 3,5mm jack, it would be the go to phone.

Ash2 0Win	Guys, if I buy this phone, this is going to be my first device without a headphone jack. Now, I don't own any high end wired headsets as such (I usu. buy cheap headphones every year or so) so in what way will the missing jack affect me? I won't be able to listen to music while charging, is that it?
Siva Shankar	Super minor issues..... üòÇüòÇüòÇhe complains about issues in the phone..... But still he never gives upon Oneplus...... And that is MKBHD...... ONEPLUS FAN BOY.....for some reason I think oneplus6 is better than this phone

Abhishek Jain	I m happy with my one plus 5t.. Still a beast üòä
Jason Chamberlain	Curious about the new fingerprint scanner. I have sweaty hands and I‚Äôm hopeless as all hell when it comes to fingerprint. Does having it under the glass improve the sensor?
James Bearpark	A lack of wireless charging isn't really a loss. If much rather plug my phone in and still be able hold it up and use it than have a big pad on a table taking up space and be unable to easily is the phone
tiktok	Pretty sure I‚Äôm getting this one.
Aven	Putting the headphone jack on the top was  obviously not possible, you know, the fingerprint sensor is to big ...
JROD	The only thing this phone is missing is a higher resolution screen amd expandable memory.    And i guess since it's a glass back, wireless charging.

Lakshay Basran	Somebody plz answer! Is it still water resistant ? Not officially, but practically and partially like the 6?

How What & Why	Large battery and finger print reader under screen is no excuse for removing headphone jack, we never asked for slower finger print reader under screen, and if they want they could have easily moved the head phone jack to top of the phone maybe???
Joey Varacalli	If they kept a dual sim and it works with Verizon and T-Mobile at the same time I will be purchasing this phone
CreativeMind	Copy of Realme 2 pro...
Tesla Maxwell	feels like a downgrade to the 5T. literally 0 reasons to upgrade. I think the best selling features for oneplus are oxygen OS and their fast charging.

Born Boy	I'd rather have fingerprint reader on the back and kept the JACK. RIP JACK.  My next phone is going to be LG. That V40 looks nice.
Jrmjuve10	I don't like that they release 2 phones a year.  The problem is they don't continue to sell the old model as soon as a new one is available.  If they did I would go for the 6 at a discounted price.
TheBlueArcadian	Should I get this or the note 9?
Arun R	OnePlus ‚ù§Ô∏è
Umang Mistry	Apart from the omission of the headphone jack. In my opinion this is the best smartphone this year!!

Matthew Perry	How's the vibration motor in the 6T? I wasn't too thrilled with the one on the 6. Compared to the Pixel 2, it felt like the OP6 had this reverb even at the lowest feedback setting.
Ianism	To be honest I already feel kinda great for being able to use an android phone with close to a oneplus 6T experience for like a quarter of the price.
Canto831	Do you speculate that the release of this model delay the release of the one plus 7?
Alden Darbouze	You keep saying volume when you mean area lol

Scott Hue	Idk the fingerprint on the Screen is still wierd to me. I HONESTLY would rather have a Physical one. THAT'S JUST MY OPINION TO ME.
Abir Hassan	thanks
Amit Dighe	One plus 6 users finally settledüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fry Szopen	I still refusing buying a phone without jack. My HTC10 audio quality is just great paired with my buds, and with viper4android the audio quality is taken to a whole new level of perfection.
Jacobus Stadler	Joo , I wish I had the money to buy one  :)
YouKnowWhy	Is anyone gonna make 4.7inch phone mini flagship anytime soon.
Praveen Bhaskar	Nope. The upgrade is not good enough to part away with my 5T. Though the most compelling reason to stick with this one is it's symmetrical notchless design...
erice	WHEN IS A NON-APPLE PRODUCT GOING TO MAKE AN ENTICING ECOSYSTEM WE NEED SOFTWARE TECH NOT HARDWARE
slick back	Yup my next phone definitely... Samsung is over-rated.....*puts LGv30 up for sale
MrYaxalot	Having a shit ass black spot on the top of your screen isn't a design choice its ignorance.
sasha mocni	Bitchslapping starts from $549 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Thanx OnePlus üôè
Arbaaz Torgal	The only thing i hate about OnePlus is there after sale service its terrible man in india 1+ 6 cost $450-500 and even small replacement and screen replacement cost more than $200-300 that sucks, phone cost $300 and display cost $180-230( 1+ 3T or 5) and it takes decade to get that done
Nishit Er	Now with S9 or Note 8 at same price... difficult to go for OP6T.
Mohammed Faisal	They need to stop the T and just sell one phone a year. After oneplus 7 just wait a year for the 8. No one wants the 6T when 7 is around the corner and when the 7 comes out the 7T will be around the corner. The T needs go stop or at least sell the T a full year later with better upgrades not minor ones, like the camera for starters
T√âCKNO GUY	Mkbhd i watch all your videos it's just that this phone is such a huge upgrade and you speak of it as not a huge upgrade and and in an uninterested manner that i have gone ahead and disliked this video.
Pygmalion Aprilis	The headphone jack is essential for me so it's a no go I guess.
Jerome Stewart	How do you have so many dislikes?!? ü§î Always A1 reviews üôå
Rushabh Patel	What's wrong in having fingerprint reader in the back. I don't understand. This is just innovation for the sake of it.

naved	Title is damn savage !
venomtail1	Kinda disappointed. No headphone jack, no phone
Bill Hendricks	With regard to the fingerprint scanner's light when using it in a dark surrounding: Since we're trying to achieve turning on the screen (which will presumably be a lot brighter than the scanner's light),  isn't this a bit like complaining about the light from around the door we're opening to enter a fully lit room?
Evan Fox	Still no wireless charging????
Nikhil Bindlish	Wallpaper
Cal Bloom	700.00 for a phone...fuck that:)
CchyDee	Yawn!

fazal 1012	RIP headphone jack
danieleg	RIP Jack
tempname 123	Yes
Booyamakashi	So they removed jack to put bigger battery, now lets drain the battery by BT to use headphones... and remember about charging headphones as well. Bleh. Im OP user from OP One... but this makes me cringe and look at other brands.

Karl Suarez	Kudos to Samsung and LG, last safe haven for the head phone jack and expandable storage.
Z Z	Disappointed on the resolution
Rajat Mukkawar	Super duper üòç
Fedor Vladimirovich	No jack no buy
Viliam Pechtor	It costs more than 6 but you are getting much more rom and battery. So the Oneplus 6T is much worth the money.
Gabrielle Wong	Oneplus 6 is already a great phone with a headphone jack but this one is without.  I'm kinda heartbroken for it.  The almost full screen looks awesome.
TheBoyJenius	I‚Äôm not gonna front, that Face ID works in any condition. Even pitch black settings. I‚Äôll give Apple that.
Hassan Sj	Man OnePlus deserves more love they release a new phone with the same price as the previous one and its better ..

hitesh jain	You said that you can directly ask the one plus in the video I wana ask you to ask one plus a small question which is a bit silly and already been answered but still why can't they make one x successor a mid budget segment smartphone
Mr Entertainment	All your starting music into one video

nacer douh	In 1:53 what he do ?
TrapStar	useless feature that we didn't ask for. Getting rid of the headphone jack just to put a slow fingerprint is dumb
PussySlayer69	Suc my dic ! why removing the fucing headphone jack ?!!!
Judd Austin	The only thing I use the headphone jack for is listening to music in my wifes car because it doesn't support Android Auto.  otherwise I haven't owned a pair of wired headphones in at least two years.  Some of y'all need to catch up to the times.
Trevlyn Stapleton	I too, feel some type of way about not having the option of the headphone jack.. but honestly, even using my OnePlus 3, I always reach for my beats x wireless earphones... And I do intend on buying the OnePlus bullets wireless along with upgrading to the 6t.   At the end of the day going wireless is my preference because my phone drops more when I use wired earphonesü§∑
Sai Saran Ogoti	AtLeast they give dongle.....
CaveMonkey	No headphone jack, for no reason ..  50% or there customer base worse off , great move!!!!
Enae Berg	Don't Listen to the people (Remove JACK). Not gonna buy .. Listen to the People like (PRESIDENT TRUMP) We Vote for YOU                 NOTE 9 = MAGA 2020
Andrewskull	Copying apple lmao
Matt	If Samsung can fit a 4000 mAh battery and an S-Pen in the Note while keeping the headphone jack, there's no reason why One Plus couldn't keep it as well.
Sharang Dev Singh	About that screen unlock animation being too bright, I think it's probably like that to help the screen unlock camera read the fingerprint correctly.
vidyasagar	I always tell , oneplus reviews from mkbhd or any top tech reviewer are always biased, oneplus know where to hit .
Rajat Bansal	Poco had a 4000 mah battery you never even mentioned it you were just like yeah some cheap phone . But here you are like ohhh so cool with 3700 mah battery c'mon fucking seriously mate like seriously . btw poco has a headphone jack

Youssif AbdElFattah	All companies should learn from oneplus how to gain more fans
Christian Anderson	This 2:1 aspect ratio is really fucking annoying on 16:9 screens. Totally unnecessary
Charan	This notch doesn't look ugly
Red-Haired Shanks	Remember when OnePlus was clowning Apple for removing the jack last year? Now look at them. SMH. Oh the hypocrisy
timmydevil999	Nitpicking is what all these tech reviewers are doing
Badar Shahzad	I don't know why more people are not talking about the Mi Mix 3. Its all screen (no notch at all), insane specs and $475. What more could you want?
Isaac Alonzo	You mean 3.7Ah battery* can ditch those useless 0's and stop inflating numbers just to appear to be larger. And that excuse to ditch the headphone jack is complete BS, they got rid of it because the OPPO phone from which they borrow the hardware did it so they had no choice.
Niellssonn A	What for wallpaper is that? ü•∞
Gulshan Mutkure	Awesome phone
Max Acton	Noice
patdel12	POCOPHONE

KenethLuna	How it works with social media? Does it have the viewfinder issue that iPhones and Pixels don't?
SLS-7	So ...They add a notch &  removed the headphone jack ?  Good job ONE+ that's exactly what we want
Teodor Kubƒõna	The Mi MIX3 is 100 bucks cheaper.
Samman Sarkar	6T=60=10√ó better than 6
Andreas Lindh√©	I think that's my favourit looking notch!
Sylvex Dragonskin	5-6 hours is not enough at all. It does have a sleek design and better notch, but Samsung will remove it completely. Same camera though? Such a weird move.
jehad malkawi	give us your opinion on kamikaze
Brandon C	anyone else noticed the date on his phone was oct 25

ctrlsoul	Sorry Oneplus. My wife and I pretty much own every oneplus from oneplus X. This will be the first one that I will not get. Reason? NO HEADPHONE JACK. Simple.
Minkierci	OnePlus should have ran with two fingerprint sensors, an in screen one and a physical one on the back...
Benjamin Cornwell	Wallpaper app?
Kyle Paxton	I do badly want this to be my next phone but it's just too big. Make it an inch smaller and I'm sold.

qwormuli	No headphone jack? Sounded promising at first, but no way in hell am i buying it now.
theultimaterom	No headphone jack = No buy.
CampingShadowComplex	That notch slapped Pixel 3 XL in the face tho
Infamous mind	My iphone 6s plus is really starting to show some age i think this would be a good choice for a new phone especially considering that Apple says their iphone XR is a ‚Äùbudget‚Äù option this beast is way cheaperüòÅ
Abhishek Parmar	I have one plus 5 from since it was launched. I bought it in emergency and due to limited budget, it's scream was shattered (I'm clumsy) it has a duplicate screen, I'm a student and my budgeting isn't in USD or any first world powerful currencies and of course my budget is low. I wanted Huawei but it's just not realistic choice for me, other phones are shiny and have bragging rights or brand following from people, but for me, I'm sure at this point that I'll have to get one plus 6t or if I can stretch it out then one plus 7. Point being, if people wonder why to begin with one chooses (pun not intended) these phones, with exception that is first world, everywhere else it's the market brackets and price positioning. It's just most sensible choice for your money. Keep in mind that premium/luxury phones are just not a realistic possibility in these situations.
Jijumon M	Meh
Wilson Capone	Hey MKBHD, do you think some time in the future phone companies will send out totally wireless headphones with their phones because of the lack of headphone jacks (and hopefully the improved tech with bluetooth and wireless headphone image/sound delay)?
manisha adivanne	What abt face unlock? Is that option available?
Juniper Rising	Currently have an LG V20. Really liking the look of oneplus. I really like the hardware of my v20 but LGs skin can be unbearable sometimes.

UnitedSound	4:56 - Guess i'm not the only one who likes Em's new album ;D
Tyler Mahone	Haven't even watched the whole video, but that intro on the new Razer phone 2 is just incredible! Holy cow!
Allan Z	love the video but really find it frustrating that phone reviews seems always omit the speaker experience which in my opinion, the one of the most important part of a phone.
Falcon Gaming	If I do a trade in with a V20, can I pay the rest or do I need to do a monthly payment for 24 months?
Anushil Kumar	Yes it will be my 4th OnePlus device
Connor L	He always refers to notches with how much "volume" they take up. I get a little tick everytime he says that over area
Anil Sardiwal	Oneplus 6T = disappointment.
Jacob	Wait...did Marques finally say DBrand is an actual ‚Äúsponsor?‚Äù I swear I‚Äôve never heard that before.
Patrick Cruz	No headphone jack, Good riddanceü§ó I hate cords more than inconvenience. It‚Äôs 2018, do you guys want your DVD‚Äôs and cassettes back too? How much time do you headphone jack fanatics need to ‚Äúcut the cord‚Äù? (Pun intended)
Jacob Boisseau	What weather app is that??
DragonTechRoyale4k	No wireless charging? üëé
Dominic Francis Baalraaj	No one really asked for an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and they give it to us. Pretty everyone much wants a headphone jack, and they take it away from us. Great!
Saad Smokerzz	i watch your reviews a lot, i love the way how you do them because you are never biased when reviewing. according to u what do u think is the perfect phone as of now with minimum flaws.
SpiderDice	Definitely getting it..I need a phone that is fast. S8 has slowed down too much over the first 1.5 years.

Sizzy Black	The vivo nex s has a 4000mah which is a bigger battery than op6t and it has in-display fingerprint. Vivo still kept the headphone jack!
RSWT	Wait what are the 3 Youtube apps for MKBHD?
Emilio Lari	is the fingerprint secure enough for payments and for your bank app to adopt it and use it for operations? if not it's completely useless

The Illuminati	I'll miss you Jacküò™üòúüòÇüò™
Emmanuel Safure	nice design but , with my experience with fingerprint scanners in build screen fingerprint takes more space rather than touch id or on the  back of the device , but its wise cause it kills the chin and notch , and becoming almost bezeless  , Samsung and apple catch up and Samsung and LG get rid of the headphone jack
Sheik Mohammed Danish	Have a look at and make a review on Vivo V11 Pro!
Gon√ßalo Santos	Going upgrade from 3T but still gonna wait a few weeks for any FingerPrint related issues...

Supreme_Xo	WE NEEDED VOOC 2 COPY! üò¢ And rip headphone jack, but I'm "okay" with it. I'll be using my OnePlus 3 until 2020.
clark Middleton	No jack = no buy
send it	5:05 battery champ? mate 20 pro impression video you should have said that and then right after that you mention quick charging. Mate 20 pro has the fastest wireless and wired charge out of any phone to date.  You are a sell out bro...
Myfujacc Myfujacc	actually more battery is drawn when screen is blackened (when screen is active)
Rafa V√°zquez	Does the fingerprint unlock only works with the screen turned on? Or can it also work with the screen off like every other fingerprint reader? In the video you always turn it on first.
Aditya Kumar	Others: OnePlus 6T impressions MKBHD: OnePlus 6T review!

Krishanu Bordoloi	Pure dope
Faisal Anwar	And the award for the most underwhelming phone of 2018 goes to the OnePlus 6T. $300 more with pretty much the same specs as the Pocophone minus a headphone jack. No notification LED, IP rating, wireless charging, stereo speakers, QHD display, SD card support or triple camera either. The OnePlus 6T is certainly not worth the money.
Rajan Saroj	wallpaper?
muhammad usama	I still recommend note 9
colla 555	As a notch hater, I am totally fine with this sexy, small notch.

R Davis	The Real Value of OnePlus- (forget all the specs) Have used the OnePlus 5 since June 2017 and it has performed flawlessly. First device I've ever had that keeps current on software, adds new features and enhancements and doesn't lag. Amazing.  Like Butter!

Roy Akash	Fell good when watch mkbhd video cz 18:9 ratio.

Dick Martino	Marques hacks off Google in the One Plus presentation. Will he get any more invites ever? Huawei Mate P20 is on trend with telephoto, normal lenses. This phone is 2018 meh! If you have to click the side button to use the on-screen fingerprint reader then that is a backward step.
pcfreak1992	The whole video I was like, this is amazing, I need this, until he said it won't have a headphone jack anymore. Now I am just ü§î
Hytts2011	Anything about Water Resistance, if OnePlus 6t has it?
Srijan Prakash	If you still use wired headphones in 2018 then it's your fault and not the phone companies'.

Find me	selfi mene lay li Aaj
GGori 99	Whatever it is, a lot of people still using the headphone jack, so yeah probably the next phone they'll choose is going to be either samsung or LG, by the way LG's flagships have been making such a terrific ehem... Old fashioned 3,5 mm jack that supports hifi 24 bit.. but.. just do whatever you want with your money anyway.
Bloodforge.R	It's an Oppo R17.
Brandon Fullem	No water resistance?
Nikhilesh Rathi	Definitely my next phone
Jakov Gudec	The 6 cost 520$/‚Ç¨ and the 6T costs 550$/‚Ç¨, how is that the same price?

x SIW	I wish I could afford one :( I'm still using my Nexus 6p lol
cwarriorsart	As a T-Mobile subscriber, yes this will be my next phone over the LG V20.
TheVerrm	Guys stop crying about jack, ip rating and notch. Go buy samsung if u need those. This phone is GREAT and if you don't like it - it still is the value king.
Mark of Excellence	I‚Äôm really tempted to sell my XS and get a 6T.
Taffy	What the hell is happening to the hood on your hoodie at 2:42? Lol trippy
tek- know	I think OnePlus is preserving the wireless charging feature for their flagship smartphone
Rey	y'all gotta stop acting like fucking 3 year olds and adapt to change, first of all theres so many things you are getting from this phone (SMALLER NOTCH) for the same price and its better, you can trade your old phone for a discount too. Y'all are crying over a fucking headphone jack rn... Some things need to be sacrificed in order to bring new and better things to the plate, you can't have everything you want. Just get a pair of wireless headphones, and stop fucking complaining ffs. PS: they also provide a pair of headphones so calm your tits
lumi	I would have to agree that the 6T isn't a big upgrade in terms of specs but it is a huge change simply because it's compatible with Verizon and maybe Tmobile down the line. You have to keep in mind that not everyone can even use the OP6 as a daily driver simply because it didn't support their carrier before.
Arclight Sama	Same one single mono speaker ?
gabry 99	Ok, I'll buy Lg v40, when it will cost 600$
jed23ify	Hopefully they can add back the headphone jack in a software update since OnePlus listens to their audience.
Steven Arias	hey Marques, how the screen quality is when you put it next to the Xs, or Samsung?
Kimvut Kimakar	Wonder how these finger print unlock really works simply on glass!?
Bilal Siddiqui	wallpaper??
Harsh Tomar	Still love my OnePlus 6üòò
Debobrato Das	its not super minor....... it will b annoying full brightness at the middle of the night......
jjblue95	can you please shed light on some slightly older phones no longer being able to go up to 1440p on youtube (like the nexus 6p) am stuck on 1080 and google and youtube support is no help.
arijit patra	Nice phone, I follow these reviews to see whats up with tech and the cinematography. I can't justify spending more than 300$ on a phone for my limited usage(Youtube,chrome, whatsapp), but these features do end up in budget phones too.
Mandala Putra	Hey, marques where did you get that wallpaper from?
kraftyw1999	I just bought the OnePlus 6 several weeks ago specifically in anticipation of the OP 6T and its omission of the headphone jack and in-screen fingerprint reader. As far as I can work out, the 6T is just a flashier 6 with some added inconvenience under the hood. The omission of the headphone jack is, at best, an inconvenience; the inclusion of an in-screen fingerprint reader is a superfluous gimmick which is slower than a conventional sensor. I'm sure it's beautifully made, I applaud OnePlus' efforts to reduce the size of the notch, and I'm glad it will make it to Verizon, but I do think this phone makes too many compromises to be considered a genuine "upgrade."
Jas Singh	essential phone's notch is first and best till now
Joel Quasebarth	I really like the wider videos, helps on the Galaxy where things aren't as cut off.
Harsh Davda	No Dash charge? Seriously?
The Sentinel Of Abyss	No headphone jack....not on my list for buying üòë
Cinematic Shots	Crisp and Clean review üî•üî•
El Canal de Alex Gutierrez	OK, Oneplus, now I see you as a real option. üëåüî•
I'm 6'2	TO ALL THE TECH SAVVY PEOPLE ON THIS CHANNEL!  Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I want to ask for help because this Black Friday I want to get my girl a phone.  Her network is AT&T and she is on a prepaid service. I‚Äôve been looking online for months now, and the cheapest I‚Äôve seen is on amazon. But many of the reviews say the sellers on amazon aren‚Äôt reliable.  I want to get her an iPhone 6,7 or 8 and I would rather get the plus versions because they have better batteries. But I am open to either one. She currently has an htc m8, so I am open to also getting her an android phone but I want to get her a ‚Äútop of the line‚Äù phone and the androids I know of (Samsung & pixel) are hella expensive.   My budget is 500$, willing to go above that but obviously I would rather go way below that. Phone doesn‚Äôt have to be new, could be used or refurbished.  Where‚Äôs the best place to buy a reliable phone, that works on AT&T prepaid network, from a reliable seller?   Thank you again, God bless
Rohit Singh	üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅ who is the dad Samsung . Oneplus apple Vivo Oppo  anyone company Samsung always f*****
Nicolas	Crazy how marques has become an argument on stage
sakkijakki	If the lack of headphone jack is a dealbreaker for you, don't buy the 6T!  I bought the OP6 when it came out and I have never used the headphone jack, I don't own any wireless charging decks, I have dropped the phone in the water and it's fine, I have still 75% of the memory left since I got the 256gb model and I got used to the notch in a few days. I only care about the speed and lag-free performance and for that this is the phone for me.
Nicu Mihai: Animatii	it gets kinda "ann√§ing"

Gazi Rayhan	How about updates?
Ariel David Atok	They removed the essential about phone.. Sd card slot,headphone jack etc and this phone has a notch plss Samsung do a incredible thing to stop this mess
Tonmoy Dhar	not buying it
Rohit Varier	Not worth the upgrade. But amazing for new buyers.
john	So you have to turn the screen on first before using the fingerprint reader? Not ideal.
oscar aroldo garcia rosales	And the wallpaper
Anis Tarek	Very wide video ever
toufik boukhalfa	MKBHD is a huawei hater. Mate 20 pro still satisfy the need of the customer and even more.
PIYUSH GADHOK	Mkbhd wallpaper link please
udit juneja	Ugly looking phone. I'm happy with my gorgeous note 9.
Abhay Soni	Wallpaper please?
Reyland	I wonder what would happen if the screen get scratches where the finger print sensor is! I prefer physical finger print reader.
Zakiy Ramadhan	Poco F1 will be my friend. I am poor and I need the headphone jack. My selfie stick use a headphone jack to take pictures. It's essential for me. Period!   Jokes aside, I'm really not hyped at all regarding this phone. Coming from OP3, I still haven't had the needs to change my phone anytime soon. Maybe next Qualcomm SoC will trigger me to buy a new one because at that time this OP3 battery will be degraded by much.
Kelssy Kinstern	Will you do impression on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 pleaseeee........
Gwynbleidd The White Wolf	I really hope Samsung doesn't remove the headphone jack. There is no reason for them to remove it. Hope OnePlus brings it back for OnePlus 7
Hamza Kasim	I would buy this instantly if I had the funds. I don't use cameras pretty much at all so in pretty much every other thing this is the best.
Raymond Kasyoka	The one that told phone manufacturers that the notch is awesome,must have played Minecraft alot  still anticipating for the Yellow iPhone XR Sir
Nirmal Kumar	I love your videos..! cuz u always stand out of the crowd..!
Subhankar Bhattacharya	All these YouTube knights, running an android phone as daily driver, wears an apple watch...!! What am I missing here.. ?
Sushant Raut	Not feeling bad currently using OnePlus 6 will upgrade after 4-5 years
venkatesh Balakumar	If we put temper glass o then how about display fingerprint?
Hariz Danial	Fun fact: people expected to have all the features available on high end phone such as apple,samsung and huawei but they want the price to be cheap... smh
Anand	It comes wid a tempered glass or not
TVA - Atheist Channel	Oh look, another DBranded phone. Anyone else sick of seeing them? It seems that every tech reviewer of late is pushing stuff. That Dbrand money must be good.
Arjun Chauhan	I don't understand the reason to remove headphone jack. For me its literally cost cutting from One plus. Because on other side if you go for VIVO NEX  you would get everything even without notch or water drop notch. - 4000 mah battery -On screen finger print sensor -Headphone jack -Elevating camera -Full screen body ratio - Vivo Nex is having Dual engine quick charge which is surprisingly faster than dash charge. it has competed fast charging of one plus 6 while having massive 4000 mah battery meanwhile one plus is having 3300 mah, i mean come on oneplus stop hyping the stuffs. - One plus 6t is having OLED but vivo nex is giving super Amoled display. - Price is same for 8GB 128GB variants. One plus now you are playing or doing business by fooling your customer.Beware with your rivals.
Felvic Tachin	Why don't you review Nokia phones?

Gurdeep Singh	Nah, I am done with OnePlus. Moved on to Galaxy Note 9 (from OnePlus 5), with a headphone jack and no notch.
Freedom Evans	Loving my OP6 ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó I like the finger print scanner on the back and the headphone jack still. OP6 was there best phone by far.
Babar W.	Any improvements on the speaker? Mine sucks on the OnePlus6. Anything about water resistance? Mine got damaged in 30 seconds water submersion. Does it have Wifi Calling? Dual SIMs with T-Mobile? Case comes too?
Fernando Valadez	I don't think it's worth the upgrade.  Might splurge and just the 6 if i see a deal
asdfghjkl	Funny thing is, he says that the 6t has been his daily driver but why do I still see him with his iPhone instead of his 'daily drivers'? ü§î
theGSi16valve	Will you do a review on a Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?  Looks pretty interesting...

Mr.Awesomestar7	I want it so bad
Sujith Gopalakrishna	Is notification led removed??
Ares	OnePlus sixty
Atul Pandey	Prob is dat mkbhd carries an iPhone x along with his android phone so most of the things which suck abt one plus are more or less covered by iPhone n he doesn't miss things like a mediocre camera or screen etc  As a standalone phone it's difficult to recommend one plus over something like a LG g7 or note 8 which roughly costs d same in India if u know how to find a deal or maybe Asus 5z which costs inr 10k less n does everything d same. One plus has betr software but Asus is betr in audio, camera, build n battery life
rohan sharma	That t-shirt though...!!!!!
Toure Evelyn	Samsung is winning on all these screen Productions right now!
Isa Shaikh	Do a video of Mi Mix 3
Victor Nazar	Its ONEPLUS six without headphones Jack
Amol lewis	Lucky i got 6 instead of 6t.. Still have my headphone jack.. Physical fingerprint scanner is quicker. Same camera, same specs but I have limited edition one plus 6 Avengers infinity war edition.. Which 6t does provide.. Overall depressed with 6t..and ya I'm still sticking to my OP6..
fallios	Lol this is terrible, waiting for s10 personally.

pasupuleti pravesh	It's simply amazing ü•∞üòç
Santosh P.S.S.	I wonder what data are they collecting from the phone to keep up with the features and price.
manish mehra	One pluse is always killer
Ocilatr	OnePlus 6s
SmileOverlord	so let me get this straight, 1- they swapped the instant fingerprint sensor on the back with a slower one that even gets annoying in night time.  2- they REMOVED a feature which everyone praised them for keeping it (the headphone jack)  3- they removed LED notification in exchange in a smaller notch (which i don't see the benefit of yet)  4-they slightly increased the battery size which was as you said in your review of the 6 not a problem even without having  wireless charging due to the super fast dash charging   yeah, the 6T is a downgrade for the same price, literally the only positive thing about it is slightly increased battery size, every other change is a downgrade IMO.   shame to see OnePlus falling for market trends instead of Listening to their customers. and thank god a bought a OnePlus 6 3 weeks ago.
satish chandra dev	I'm still pretty much happy with my OnePlus 5...  And my phone have a feature which OnePlus 6T doesn't offer... "Head phone jack"üòÅüòÅüòÅ

Oisin Portley	My next phone
Nont55	No jack = deal breaker
Vijay Balsubramaniam	I think the biggest area according to me from one plus is that they do not support bands across all carriers which gives them a small market to sell their phones. Their 1+6T is awesone but should cater to all carriers which will boom boost their sales and they can even overtake iph and sams in the market. I use one plus 3 but i have limitation to 2-3 carrier only.i want to use one plus but do not have the flexibility. MKBHD sir let me know ur views in this and whether one plus should focus on this area. I am a one plus fan from last 5 years.
Dr RF	Damn  !! these Notches keeps getting uglier ....

Cthelab 04	No headphone jack? No wireless charging? Who cares? Bluetooth is the way forward, as is wireless charging, but unlike bt headphones wired charging is better anyway. And its insane value.

Mixalis Milias	when you got paid by 1+ but didnt admit it and act like nothing happen... then they "keynote" you at their event and you got busted .... and u talk about smoothness even the last years google phone is 10 x smoothest than 6and6T as xda and other non paid reviewers test and said.....1+ is sure fast but it never was smooth =) seems like chinese Paid eveyrone this days !sad mkbhd u got the wrong road thats why you lost a lot of subscribers and u keep loosing everyday after this video =)

Micheal vivek	Will the 1+6 get gesture 2.0.?
Rishi Khurana	Although I always wanted to try oneplus phones but i was never able to buy one because they don't offer expandable storage option and having a micro ad in your phone really helps if anything goes wrong with the phone. We can simply take the micro sd out and get a new phone. That's why I always have to spend more to but samsung note series or s series mobile phone. Oneplus should get a sd card slot in their phones and i can say that I am ready to buy a new one from oneplus every year rather then samsung

Lehel-S√°ndor Kiss	They're really getting lamer every year. Getting rid of the headphone jack is a real shame. They are just trend followers now. Props for Samsung and LG for keeping it real in the Android world.
Callahan Johnson	No headphone jack?!?! Oneplus, how could you? You were one of the few remaining companies holding out for the people...
Marky 360	The lack of a headphone jack makes this phone irrelevant to me just like every other phone without it.
Vamsi Vardhan	Man you are setting THE standards for the youtube videos editing out there so classy

Jwala Prasad Baranwal	What about OnePlus 6 pricing?
Steven Jones	YESSS... It's my next phone
nuyou21	So BBK electronics just mixed the OnePlus 6 back and the Vivo V11 Pro‚Äôs front to give you the 6T. So much for Never Settle! üìµü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíØ
dashing das	when apple launched the new iPhone xs with the exact same price as that of an x.. all the tech channels out there completely made videos against apple..stating not to buy it as it is not worth the upgrade....****these dumbass biased YouTubers..but for 6t no Jack.. .it's ok.       no fast unlocking experience avoiding the gold standard fingerprint..
Arsalan Taj	How can i exchange my oneplus 6 for oneplus 6t

Yatindra Manas	That! Is! My next phone!
Umesh Writes	Powerful Mkbhd
Dawar Khan	Notch looks Cool üòé. Under Glass fingerprint Sensor good at this point of time where other companies used other fingerprint sensors. Oneplus main thing that these phones are comparatively have a less price than other flagship devices.  Best By Oneplus
Mr. X	That fingerprint reader animation though üòçüòç

Lars H	Glad I bought the oneplus 6! Can't miss the headphone jack (yet...)
SIDDHARTH KHANNA	Wearing an Apple Watch while doing the one plus 6t review , not sure if it was intended. Nice video as always
Firepower	WTF is that time doing up in that top left corner ? Never looked so out of place. The rest is pretty nice though
Robert Dempsey	Marques pressed the side unlock button before the on screen fingerprint button was pressed. Is this something that you need to do every time or can you just wake and unlock the phone with the on screen unlock button?
Jay Jones	I like the "curvyness" of the notch, feels a bit smoother
Priyansh Modi	Try Mi MIX 3!
Delain124	It would have but the Pixel has more of what I want.
satvik pisipati	Can we unlock with the fingerprint sensor without turning on the phone ?
Brandon Rutledge	I'd buy the one plus if i had the ios ecosystem on it :(
Rohit yo	Hey Will you review RED PHONE .
abner herna	Pixel 2xl or OnePlus 6???
Masoom Humza	I am going to wait for the Oneplus 7. It just doesn't feel a huge upgrade from my Oneplus 6.
jeesen bobby	Still Mate 20 pro is best

Kyle Haden-Tebb	Bruh the event was boring af
Chispa Motivation	Watching this from my OnePlus 6.
Robert Taracha	F
Isy Zoom	Please, make a review of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3
Adam	OnePlus 6T or Pixel 3 XL?
Maru C	Motorola still has headphone jacks... Why do people forget that Motorola is still an existing company with great phones??
Rohan Pallati	which is better Iphone XS  or 1+ 6T??
Vishal Gupta	Hihihi
Jas	I'll get the Mix 3 instead
Jemiide	I don't care about the jack. Was thinking about updating my Nexus 5X to Pixel 3, but 6T becomes more and more interesting. Will wait a few days to see what issues it has but it sure sparked my interest. I wonder if it'd be easy to get used to front fingerprint after 3 years having it on the back.
Farizan S	No headphone jack, no cardslot, and yes for the notch. Why not just use Iphone?
Francis pe√±a	Wow  Y'all idiots know there ain't no headphone jack or micro sd slot and no quad hd dispay, no wireless charging, no nothing.... BUT HEY ITS STILL THE BEST PHONE MONEY CAN BUY RIGHT???!?! LG g7 might be everything and more at this exact price Whatever
Nikhil Venkata	Casey's using your merchandise and you're using his. What a marketing strategy
tykszeto	Tag line: Notch done right
Faiyaz Nihal	It would be my next phone if I could afford it.

Fellow 9 year old	5:30 Asus kept the head phone jack .. ZenFone 5Z
Krenon	oneplus <3 would buy if i wouldn¬¥t have the 5t

DMV 49	you have no idea how badly i was waiting for this review!!! aaahhhhhh.. pretty damn excited....
Kippenoma	It seems really thick... Is it annoying?
Robert macharia	I love it, great move.
Alan Shepard	I hate this notch trend.  HATE it.  Will never ever buy a phone with a notch.  What are consumers putting up with this?!  If you use a phone as a media device then why would you willingly buy a product that disrupts one if those major uses.  When you go to the movies do you sit behind someone wearing a big hat to obstruct your view?!  I despise this trend.
Deon Spates	Cool!
Saad Ahmad	Video is too laging
Shantanu Mahanty	Brace Yourselves for OnePlus 6T reviews everywhere
Akhyar Ahmed	Hey nice shirt. Where did you get it
miftaul mannan tasin	I would take rear fingerprint and a jack rather than on screen fingerprint and no jack any day everyday
village vaala	Can you please it to me.pleaseee.....!!! üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Rahul Jadhav	We want a comparison between one plus 6 and 6t
Deepak Singh	Better than pixel 3XL
Bodi Games	Oneplus is so bad that they Copy APPLE AND SAMSUNG AND MORE THAT IS OUT IN THE MARKET! 2. the device doesnt feel premium it looks old!
Ankush Jadhav	Yes
madcityy	Why do they insist on removing the finger print reader in the back? It's the best spot for a big phone. Also, no headphone jack? OnePlus pls.
Abdullah _sav	Liking this video for that notch pun already.
Filippos Bamopoulos	If we're gonna call this an incremental update we might as well call every update that.
THE ICON	You forgot to say that even though it's only for the USA that you get three hundred bucks back on a plethora of folds including all the entire history of the OnePlus also that they have a DAC in the bottom even though they don't have an earphone jack but they included a dongle so that's pretty impressive I'm not sure if the earphones comes with it if it does at least it's at the value of 20 bucks not the wireless but still that's pretty impressive but going back to the phone thank you for the feedback on the fingerprint reader that's good to know but I think when you trade in your phone for some people like that have an eligible phone it works out to almost $11 a month extra instead of the standard 30 bucks that you would get $4,000 phone so this is by any means very acceptable I can't wait to see the 7 and send it to you and if they have it treated for those every 6 months at least until the 70 comes out I have a 3 T which I upgraded from the one original with Cyanogen on it I am super impressed with the Hawaii meat 20 Pro and equally impressed with the note 9 still so the price is really what selling me on upgrading from the 3T which by the way was supported over three OS updates it came with the six went to the seven went to the 8th and we'll get the 9 in January for first-quarter so they really take care of their customers still which is great
? ASHRAFUL	i have question ... i saw many of review of OnePlus 6T.. when you change your default wallpaper .. the fingerprint down little bit...i mean its get slow...
veeresh sangolli	A little disappointed üòï
SaDate shaWdik	your review video was in the lunch event...I was surprised and happy to see that...üòäüòä

Samriddha Basu	Didn't the OP6 base model cost $529? ü§î
Oskari	Still happy with my 5T
Braden Purcell	Loved seeing you on Joe Rogan Show!
justaskfor bob	This proves that Apple is not any longer the leader and that there's out there a healthy and very competitive, rivals to learn from... ive been following this brand from some time and they keep getting better and better
Hadri Hanafi	im watching this video on one plus 6..i will sacrifice headphone jack for 3700mah battery.. :(

RAK Rahat Ali Khan	Soo should i buy it? Our wait 180 days for one plus 7? ü§î
aditya narang	Sterio speakers?
Akshay	There is literally nothing new in 6t  except little bigger battery and besides this it looks downgrade from 6.....i am feeling like fuck OnePlus in a corner standingly.üëøüëø
XillReall ViZ	While note 9 can fit a spen , a 4000mah battery and a headphone Jack. Seriously oneplus?
Salazryl Ismail	That Casey Neistat's shirt üòç
Mayank Maheshwari	One plus 6 users are now finally settled üòÇüòÇ
Jeremy Tanudtanud	can the gestures be disabled?
WANKLE WAVE	Oneplus was doing quiet well before but unfortunately will loose the market with this phone... Mark my words.
SN Entertainment	Lots of changes within 4 months unlike those releases every after 1  year.....
NOSBOJ's Tech	You guys made big fuzz when iphone took their headphone jack but when oneplus took it you guys didn't make any fuzz about it why?
Amey Gaikwad	Same specs same design nothing new..!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
PRATHEESH	Do we have to turn on the display to use the in-display finger print scanner?  What the Hell
Bryan marshall	Notch is as big as your pimple
thegillband	Everyones like RIP audio jack. But the notification LED also dead. RIP.
phrozenmenace	No thanks...I would rather have a headphone jack than a "slightly" half-assed fingerprint reader. I guess congrats are in order, good job on being different while doing some of the same unwanted things as others.
Valkyrie Games	Just like oppo and vivo design.  As usual.  But much better
Giwrgos K	If you send me one for free it will be my next phone :D :D
Tanish Sharma	After watching this I am gonna buy OnePlus 6 strangely lol if they don't make it out of stock
Rohan Srivastava	It looks like Marques hates Samsung so much
Vedanshu Thakker	Luck you, You got a OnePlus 6t, I want one two
honar safar	Mi mix is better than this
VJB TV	:)
Shawn Stone	NOOO they've turned to the dark side :.(
rahul lakhanpal	Is it me or anyone else can't even afford the phone but just wanna see it and keep dreaming of getting it üòä
ori hadad	I genuinely was going to buy this phone but it doesn't have a headphone jack so I think I'll go for the note 9
mynameisray	Notch and chin, no thanks. Why do people copy shitter Apple.
Anthony Webb	Nice phone but I will stick to my Xs max beast best phone you can buy today yes it‚Äôs a lot of money but wat a phone it is bravo Apple
Daniel Waite	How do you like the gestures in this new model, are they any smother?   You said they weren't iPhone smooth on the 1+ 6 so you turned off gestures and just used the on screen buttons.
Loomis	I was dead set on getting the Pixel 3 until its underwhelming release and reports of lag right out of the box.  The more I learn about the OP6T, the harder it is to find reasons to buy the Pixel 3
Gaurav Rana	Does it have always on display option?
DVP Reviews	*RIP Jack* üôÉ *Now I'll go with Note 9* üëΩ
Bharat Subrahmanyam	I can never buy a phone without a headphone jack ... Cya from my options list 1+ :(

Faique	Oneplus Unlocks Speed For Sure ... Fingerprint Sensor Speed Will Be Boosted Up Sooon ...
The Wolverine	Now Oneplus 6t is out, I can finally buy Oneplus 3.
kuks in Sweden	My dream phone
Sam Waris	Great review as always, but from what I can compare and after seeing this phone, I am more inclined towards the huawei mate 20x, it's got 5000 mh battery and a headphone jack.
Shanboss	got a pixel  3 ad
bapan Saha	Its cant defeat huawei mate 20 pro
Dr.ManHat	It's $550...lol why are people comparing it to $700-900 phones. If u didn't get something in this phone that's cause you literally weren't charged for it.
Mohamed Alfalo	That SOT is worse that my 5t which averages 7 hrs including at least 5 hrs of YouTube.
Kristian Larsen	My. Dog. Is. Deadüò≠
Manjari Bose	I love you bro
Yogesh Gosavi	you should try asus zenfone max pro m1 :3   it sounds silly yes :P but it's definitely beast in terms of battery backup <3    5000mAh battery ends up giving around 10hours SOT on normal usages
suman swarnakar	The most loved smartphone of India üíô
Smokin old	MBKHD: a hipocrite who hates big bezels but puts them in his videos...
ImjustSaiyan 92	As much as I love MB's reviews, I hate how he acts like OnePlus still designs their phones. Oppo sets the design and OnePlus follows it. Oppo wanted the headphone jack gone, OnePlus magically wanted it gone. Oneplus is not a small, rag tag company, it's backed by the largest phone manufacturer in Asia.
KingCrusty	Looks great, but RIP me, i'm on Verizon.
Gaurav Rasal	Anyone saw the 6666 cards? ;)
UFCMMA93	how about the camera??
Daniel Edin	RIP Notification LED.
Derek Lee	So is there no option to have the phone unlock via being at certain locations or connected to certain devices?
Michael Paul	I'm so tired of these all black phones!!! Give some a traditional metal colored frame. To me those always look the most premium and ad a nice contrast. When the metal frame is painted black it looks boring and cheap to me
show by your choice	im broke don't know why im watching thisüòÖ
SUPER USER	That sensor in one plus 6t is optical which can be easily fooled , wait for 3d ultrasonic fingerprint scanner from Samsung in galaxy s10..
r .ra	Boring phone
ne0tic	My next phone would be this or an iPhone Xs Max :)
TJay	I got a one plus 6 a few months back and it still runs like a dream. I love it. One plus for life.
Nams	I hope you get Mi Mix 3 soon. I'd liked to hear the review from you.
Matt Morris	Still waiting for a company to partner with MKBHD to let him design his own phone
WebWolf89	Real notches have curves!
Bunny	Wait... fast-charging brick included in the box ?! For no extra money ?! WTF?
Jayant Karmakar	Please do the review of Mi Mix 3, it's the best no notch phone
Cristian Henriquez	Anyone know if this has dual speakers?
Villa Android	Is perfect,
ascendence	most boring and incremental update, why wasnt this criticized ?
Vues d'En Haut.	So the One Plus 6T is WOW !! But the Mate 20 Pro is a SH*T ... OH cmon !!
Vinay Gollapudi	Bought OnePlus 6 recently and I am happy with it. Will skip 6tüòä
shashi bhushan	if anyone from apple gonna look up to the comments on this vid, here's my word. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL AN UPGRADE!
Kevin Batts	Such an amazing phone
ADK photography hub	Man explain me...I saw Dave 2d..I saw unbox therapy..and everything...but you videos look so movie quality..so smooth..so high quality..so satisfying...üòçüòç
Shashank Gvs	Try using the 3rd party wallpaper and test the fingerprint reader..
Aman Tomar	No Jack No dealüññ
Arun k	Please I want these phone wallpaper
Claudius Boasman	Great video but what about the speaker? Is it still the same down facing mono speaker with the same volume? I hope they improved the loudness now that they have removed the headphone jack. RIP hpj.
Pratap Kanojia	Great stuff and details plus great presentation and video!
Jacob Scott	I just don't like the fingerprint reader in the screen
ferze001	value is ridiculous for this phone. talking to you, greedy apple fucks...
Stefan Cloete	It looks really cool. I am still a bigger IPhone fan, but if thr one plus was in South Africa I would definitely recommend and consider it
EMMANUEL EKAMBI BOANA	taking out the headphone jack is a crime against humanity
Ronith Sonu	OnePlus6T or Mi Mix 3? What's your pick guys?
bigmankz	Almost every youtube tech reviewer and most users of any smartphone in the world say that they need the headphone jack. Why nobody listens? Why???? I hope that with introduction of wireless charging they will not remove the type c connector.
Sener S	Pocophone is better than this.
Dee :3	Phone's screens keep getting bigger...... I LOVE IT...
Gavin Ent	Yes this is going to be my new phone, I will be scraping my IPhone 6s and going with the OnePlus 6t
royston palmer	Yep ill be getting it November 6th....happy days....
Yeasin Mahmud Jesan	Nobody talking about the Notification Light... They were good...if they had to get rid of that ..why cant they just implement it on the screen ... just a few pixel light up whenever and however you want ...
Gadget Buff	Nice Vid but plzz advice the wallpaper u used in 6T ?
Wonder WhyZ	This looks great!
Jhaco Meemo	U filmed in an 18 by 9 aspect ratio Didn't have to zoom in on my p20 pro
Yashohit Shukla	Watching in it op6
Abhishek Saxena	its okay just for upgrade nothing is new in 6T
kevin perez	5T needs Pie already.. wth
Abbreviated Reviews	Are you a Big Phone-Person or a Big-Phone Person?
itsjustanameman	They raised the price $20 in Canada. Still a good buy but ughh whyyy
Petko Banchev	Great release from OnePlus as always! I am considering this one or the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3. Are you getting one to review soon?
Ahsan Amanullah	Definitely my next phone!
TheOddacious	Notification light moved or gone?
Pranav Radhakrishnan	The Pixel 3 we all wanted! üòâ
hello	so, it is safe to say that if a person is a one plus fan it would be best to wait for the T version and don't waste no money on the regular one.
Rayan Qazi Syed	I was all on the one plus hype train for the past few years but guess the headphones jack station is where I get off
LeVolontaire	The music IS 20syl and Oxmo Puccino
varun singh	i am an apple fan, but personally after looking to this new model. I am sure to what i am going to say that oneplus 6t is really amazing looking phone and for sure they are better than samsungs and other androids
visag anilkumar	We waiting for this detailed using review.. bro???
Manhar Bhatia	OnePlus 6t vs Mi Mix 3 should be a good a comparison video. Both aim to be best budget flagships. 6t edging ahead with bigger  battery but mi mix 3 comes with wireless charging and a wireless charger included in the box which is insane at this price point !!!
Bipin Ramanna	Rip jack.. And slot a seat in heaven.. Wired charging coming soon
Ronald De La Cruz	Mi Mix 3 or OnePlus 6T? ü§î
someone xD	HAHAH NO Headphone Jack
Maharishi Kashyap	I haven't watched the video yet. Did I read that title wrong? Is that "Same design, more price"?
Ariel Ortiz	I got the 5t when it came out and I still love it - nothing is wrong w my phone and it's held up well but I want this phonnnnnnnne
cryTHINK	Bangsat ini hp keren parah... I waaaaannttt iitttt

nelvinsamson	hey Marques, can you please make a video comparing the new pixel 3 vs the oneplus 6t?
TheWaruiSama	How about a Sony xz3 review?
Marco Maza	It's a shame we can't buy this phone in Mexico
CaptObvious	Man that lack of headphone jack is still such a bummer, gotta look somewhere else to replace my 3t
Rot A	I clicked due to that wallpaper !
Triscia Clarke	I stopped using cell phones in 2015. I am loving it!  No stress, using a watch again, writing letters to friends and instant gratification gone (more patient).
Ahmed Ali	Shut your mouth stupid  Black  Mate20 pro is abest
Theresa Tekenah	You wear really cool teeshirts. I like the unlock stuff. The phone is okay for the price.
Harsh Ratnu	Whoa that was really slow 3:42
Sam Dixon	Favourite thing about everyone complaining about the headphone jack is that most wouldn't even be able to notice quality difference between the jack and usb c or Bluetooth. By removing the jack we're telling companies we want a better way to listening to our audio, whether that be better battery life on bluetooth, or a new generation of tech that allows for us to have the quality while taking up less space etc etc
Pancho	I could handle the copycat apple designs but damn there is literally no reason to not have a headphone jack. Besides of course saving money for the company
Rachit Monga	Headphone jack>in-display fingerprint scanner.
D3pth of fi3ld 3nt3rtainm3nt	when the company  selling  100000000 phones and make $100000.00000 then they remove  the headphone jack
jony johan	Finally my love is coming
bradley townsend	Still waiting on the re release of the matte black AirPods üíî
Jake Sully	If I had to pick between 6 and 6t I would still pick the 6.
444Lukas444	First you have to wake up the screen than scan it? To much time and effort.
Jonas Meinhardt Pedersen	Just got the OnePlus 6T ad one this vidüòÇ
Dominic Omamuzo	I like the display and the built-in fingerprint scanner. It's a good phone
EXTERNAL CONCLUSION	One day our grand children will ask us about how the head phone jack looked like and how painful it was to take out your headphone and push the chord into the jack.
TheLawrence05	Still ugly as fuck
U K	1:39 did the information just appear in the backed out area in the "Hidden mode"?
Adrian Bailey	OnePlus doesn't get enough credit for the quality of their phones. I'm still extremely happy with my 3T (except for mediocre camera software). This phone could go another 2 years easily. Giving serious thought to the 6T, especially for the price.
Nido Carlos	XZ Premium anyone?
Sameer Sj	Lot of Information on the go....  I remember your words.... "GOOD PHONE'S GETTING CHEAP" ‚úåÔ∏è ONEPLUS is the Only company that looks into their Customers directly and hear them... But Exemption of Headphone jack üò™
Somnath Paul	OnePlus 6T copied from Vivo V11 Pro. After watching this video I can say that Vivo V11 Pro is far more superior than 6T in terms of face recognition and in display fingerprint reader. I am proud owner of V11 pro
LinkToo	5:36 the lie detector test determined: that was a lie
Utkarsh prakash	Even the one plus removed headphone jack...
Tashreef Araf	A smaller notch, bigger base storage, an in screen fingerprint sensor and same price  VS  same phone with no upgrade whatsover, removal of headphone dongle and a 100 dollars more for base storage.   See MKBHD, the former is not an "incremental upgrade in every sense of the word" if the latter is too. The former gives us a lot more than the latter ever did
Prayaas Bhagat	What i got from this video is that u like Lucky You a lot üôÉ
Vamsi Krishna Reddy	do you follow tech altar channel? coz its way awesome and too underrated.
AL ROD	That's the kind of notch that is acceptable, imo
Crypto Orell	Pointless upgrade. I have my OP6 not gonna upgrade :3
Rabindra Mallik	glass fingerprint sensor/face id/bezelless/notch/ample storage/astonishing camera....wat nxt now for a flagship *except wireless charging
Kanish Dangol	Nice T-shirt Marques!
Tanweer Alam	@Mkbhd How apps like Instagram or YouTube or Netflix adjusts to that Notch??
Ryan Aarya	So you cannot use fingerprint scanner while the screen is off
mihovecz jozsef	Next phone definitely
Sayid Abyan	no headphone jack  ur welcome
Shawn Lewis	1:07 Always wondered how he did these. Now we have the truth. Look at the window.   Great shot, man.
Prakashh Krishnan	Pretty sure oneplus 6 users must be relieved after watching this video.
Zetplan‚Ñ¢	Realme is better than oneplus 6t i am right!!!
Shinji Oli	Boring and no longer the flagship killer (still expensive to me). Pocophone F1 is the king.
Sadistical	I'm hopping to see you or Unbox Therapy do a Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review soon!
Sanam Rana	Dony use Black bars .....
botsok3skelion	B.S.!!! Removing headphone jack and not including wireless charging is such a lame move... üëéüèª  RIP OnePlus... you‚Äôll always be in our memories.   From the fans once a of ‚ÄúNever Settle‚Äù smartphone company.
Mustafa Mirza	Time to say Goodbye to Apple. Rip IPHONE. Way better software optimization and support than Apple. Apple being a largest company which can easily afford lastest technology but don't do it but heads off to ONEPLUS a small company which give you literally after thing in very small amount. Nice ONEPLUS üëç
Naveen Boddu	Remove headphone jack and also usb port when you provide true wireless headphones and wireless charging in box as standard
Sajish Shrestha	liked for the notch pun
RES√òNANCE	I have oneplus 6.. now i want 6tüôÑüòÉ
SickBoy offc	How about Meizu 16th? It's have under display fingerprint sensor, no notch, dual speaker, and still have jack.
knoxieman	How is the finger print reader on the front an upgrade? so you have to go from using one hand to 2 hands? with it on the back you can unlock the phone before it comes out of your pocket, and no headphone jack is dumb, ill stick with the 5t thanks.
Pavin Ubolchitt	Which one has better battery life? Oneplus 6T or iPhone XR...
Moab A	Says a moment of silence for the loss of the headphone jack but doesn't pause. Smh just rude RIP headphone jack, you will be missed <3.
Sam Martin	Finally calling DBrand your sponsor.
GrandSil90	Please go back to 16:9 Not everyone watxhes on a 2:1 phone or 21:9 monitor, the black bars are annoying.
charls seal	Blackberry still has headphone jack.
Dirtymick4ever	No headphone jack, no buy
Muawia Yasin	Yup, it is time to upgrade from my op2 to op6T
shubham paswan	6t ‚ù§Ô∏è
Therald Clayton	If it works on sprints network as well. Then yeah I'll definitely get this.
Faruk Jamal	Does it still have the notifications LED light?
Mateusz or≈Çowski	I'm just waiting for better speakers, anyone knows have they improved it?
Damian C	5:58 This is how you do storage pricing options! Apple should be taking notes.
saurav verma	Not an upgrade but a downgrade from OP6. No Headphone Jack, no new performance, No new camera or better quality in screen (Like Samsung or LG)..No HDR screen, nothing new I can see..
MurTaz GamIng	Naah, 6 plus is better than 6t because it has a headphone jack and also have finger print at the back and it's damn fastüòç
Gungan	No jack, no buy.
Ayush Gautam	2 min silence for one plus 6 users.
Schulte	is this headphone Jack adapter, which was showed, in the package itself?
bojassem12	Glass back is so stupid and useless, why would I want a back that would break more easily.
santosh saravanan	Rip The Jack <=> Jack The Ripper. Nice one there
SkyTheDestroyer-	Speed test comparison with the Asus Rog phone.
Nitin Rane	yup its the next phone for me
Ahmad Bilal	Lackluster. The one word comes to mind for 6T.
Mazen Mahari	Why can't they come out with the Red color already
Swe Slipknot	Im still waiting for galaxy s10
Kartik Nikam	Awesome video, I was somewhat excited for the 6T before the launch but after this video I'm really excited. 6T looks really coool.! üëç
–ê–ù–î–†–ï–ô	–ì—É–¥...
Daniel Terrazas	I wanna!
Nilay Ojha	One plus just keep pushing the game ... what a package! And MKB has been one up with some new tech off late .. sort of beta tester now with to be launched phones...
Mahady Hasan	All those people cry about HP Jack, This has the in screen fingerprint sensor which takes up the space of 3.5mm hp jack. its a trade off. you can't get everything in one package. also the biggest win is the 400mah battery increment. Also bonus feature is the tiny notch . Its really cute
SHAGS 2018	5:38 poor use of space, Samsung managed to fit in a 4,000mah battery and an spen in the note9. And they still had enough space to fit it a goddamn heat pipe
Kapil Inamdar	at 1:12 are you moving towards window(along with the phone) or the phone is stationary and just the camera is moving.(parallax effect seems too good)
Arpan Ojha	It's like vivo v11 pro
Pawan Mahajan	Oneplus gave you FALSE reason for removing 3.5mm jack. The REAL reason is they have to use Oppo R19's design which doesn't has it...üòä
Abi Studios	Very much disappointing. 1. No headphone jack. 2. In screen fingerprint sucks.  I'll stick to my OnePlus 5....  PS: probably wouldn't buy a OnePlus in future, if the screen fingerprint reader sucks.
Swapnil Pandit	Rip iphone xr
The Advisor Files	Man sounds like a great phone but im hating notch life. I understand it just not a fan. At the same time samsung maybe dropping the headphone jack which is a bummer. If i find good bluetooth headphones or earbuds this might be a good switch
Bobby Chow.	Seen every single review....but still waited for MKBHD  ...... fanboy......
Chaitanya Atre	slick
Trevor Foster	Lucky You Kamikaze on Spotify. Nice
Kirk Buchanan	OP6T winning!
TheMindstorm	is the top still kind of curved like the OP5T and OP6?
Ebtoulson	Pretty sure this is going to be my next phone. With the rise of $1k smartphones this one stands out at sub $600. Wireless charging and a headphone jack would have been nice but I guess you have to cut corners somewhere.

Steven Goossens	not upgrading from my oneplus 6 but it is still a great upgrade, and the same price. Can't wait what oneplus will do with the oneplus 7
Nada Mohamed	Puts apple to shame

MafionzoR	oneplus - made 9 phones without a single major flaw. great job! love them, sticking to my oneplus 3, ultra cheap but powerful
yedija luhur	Do you agree that every phone is kinda boring right now? especially in android ecosystem since we are bombarded with a lot of phone with basically the same basic function, same specs, almost same design, same material, and same marketing. i see no uniqueness for this new one plus phone except only for people who are loyal with the brands, or maybe availibility in some country.
Karl Ranile	No headphone jack and with a notch? Goodbye oneplus

MTT Now!	does it work with Verizon now?  edit: yes
Anders Johan Inntjore	i do love your 1:2  res
David Zita	the reason i hate 1plus is its stock android every phone with stock android is boring, i dont buy a phone with stock android i mean whats is the difference  between A $50  android pie and $500 phone with stock android pie.  there is no difference. the usage and feeling is the same. I love phones with a bit of customisation. that's why i love Samsung Touchwiz ,Meizu, Huawei, LG it stands out from the crowd. Snapdragon 835 even if you throw in a skin still performs well. Gone are  the days when android was heavy for the cpu. today's cpus can handle everything you throw at it very well. I hate stock android, looks empty, shallow and unfinished.
soumyadeep biswas	No headphone jack a bummer for me.
ZEID KAZI	And you were taking about how not good is mate 20 pro... How near is this phone to m 20 pro

Shrihari tripathi	RIP headphone  RIP pewds
Zulian  Khan	Preety goddamn smooth and fast
Gravity Sync-Z	I really hope that Samsung doesn't ditch the headphone jack
Neil Visarra	No headphone jack which means no DAC. No boomsound. No IP68, no wireless charge. Only 1080p display. No wide angle camera. No thanks, I'd rather have the V40.
Ben	Really not feeling the lack of headphone jack, considering that the in-screen fingerprint reader isn't as fast or useful as the reader on the regular 6.
AiR tv	I'm not a big fan of 6t hj and ip isn't there so yeah not a big fan
Mr. Ash	Love it, buying it
john kir	Way better then the iPhone notch
taksh16	Sup?
Aisha Galayax	I think the fingerprint scanner in 6t is slower than oneplus 6
Super Mayo	I'm kinda in need of a new smartphone and this sounded all very interesting up until the point where you said they removed the headphone jack. I refuse to buy a phone without it. Fuck this anti-consumer bullshit.
areeb1296	5:45 Just shift the headphone jack to the top?

A	What about the camera.
Muhsin	Imagine Oneplus making a "low budget" phone with amoled display and a stunning look, like they did it with oneplus x,  priced around $200. üòÉ
S Kundu	White dude
middy77	Unlocking your phone at night in bed is going to be really annoying... I use the rear finger scanner at night because faceunlock burns my eyes.. so happy I didn't wait for the 6t.. sad it's the only oneplus phone I won't own to date
Daniel Vos	Yoh I don't always like it when companies increase their Base storage options, 'cause that normaly means you pay way more, but I'm very glad they're not increasing the price with the upgrade.
ORION STAR	I think if they should make camera housing with clear plastic or something clear so that all you see is cam lens only, blending with glass screen instead of black housing. That or hide cam in top bezel?
Internet Talent	I still don't understand why Google couldn't have done their screen like this. They could've even went the route of the essential phone's notch.
CZARNYEU	Great Evolution of OP :-) REgards from Europe from my channel Bro's
andronienn	I'm against screen fingerprint philosophy. I should keep the always on display feature or wake up the phone with power button. I will not buy this phone!
Monali Kulkarni	The one flagship that lets us live with our kidneys
Parth Jain	ayo wtf ? iPhone XS is the same upgrade too.¬† -better battery -better performance -better camera for the same price
Ni hal	OnePlus is future, gonna be the biggest company, bigger than Samsung.
Fede leo	6:46 "from our sponsors dbrand" I really like your videos and have been watching for a long time but I don't understand why you don't use YouTube's feature where it said at the start of the video that it is sponsored content. There is also no mention of the sponsorship in the description. You have said in the past you want  to stay as transparent as possible but this does not look like you are really trying.
Alex Penney	Nice shirt
Bernard Manyandure	nice move with the playing cards...

Pim Nelissen	How about that Mi Mix 3 though... No-notch full screen display, using a slider phone design. It's awesome.
Maroof Juneja	Really impressed by under display fingerprint scanner. They did it before Samsung, apple, google, lg, razor......
Carlo Canta	The notch hide feature is what Google should have done.
Alex Delgado	Yes it is my next phone... I still holding a 1+ 3T... Waited for this moment!!
lukeerambo	Rocking my note 9 no lag what so ever waiting for s10 would be a game changer
Harshil Patel	Physical fingerprint reader still better
Aslak Myhre	If you will have a inscreen fingerprint scanner (wich will be slow) you will need that animation
Slick X	My OnePlus 3 is still working great. I'll stick to it until OP7.
HUGO	nice... onePlus 6T
gal gold	do you have to turn the screen on before using the fingerpring reader?
Anuj Kumar	One Plus is one of the most copy cats and unoriginal phone. However they almost always copy the good stuff.
Nilupul Malinda Kulathunga	I currently own a OnePlus 6. The only compelling improvement for me is the 3700 mAh battery. Rest of the 6T is... meh! I have mixed feelings. I'm skeptical about how that fingerprint sensor is gonna work with a tempered glass screen protector.
MrNobody	Sellout as always
Kushal Dutta	No IP certification No Stereo Speaker No Headphone Jack No QHD screen G7+ is better  Poco F1 is still the most value for money.
Anas Al Alawa	Why you don't cover the new mi mix3 from xiaomi
Bartosz G√≥rski	No LED notification!!! Wtf!!!

Arshil Ahmed	15 hr screen on time here üòÇ
Erik Klokset Vestvik	Very nice! Just bought a 6 the other day, not knowing the 6T was just around the corner, but I'm happy with the 6. I like having the jack, and I really enjoy how fast the fingerprint reader on the back is, so even though the notch is better (imo) and the battery is larger, I would still have gone with the 6. But it's great that they made the changes for the 6T, as there are plenty of people who disagree with me on those deciding factors.
Waylander	Nice phone
Spaceplayer1	Can that fingerprint unlock animation be patched via software? That looks extremely gimmicky to me
Nattaphat Wongweerachotkit	Wasn't the 6 starting price $529? I'm not sure though.
Austin Anderson	The starting price is not the same. $529 for 6, $549 for 6T. Storage is doubled and battery is much bigger but still. The upper models are the same price, but starting is different
Bedasubash Tonmoy	Kamikaze the G.O.A.T.!!!!

i007Awesome	Will the 6t have sprint compatibility??
Wayne	It is screen supported Netflix HDR?
Don Mui	Marques, just curious, do you still personally use wired headphones on your phones? You mention a moment of silence for the loss but just curious if it really impacts you? I personally prefer to use BT so could really care less if it's gone and at least where I am all I see around me are BT users.
hundio88	No headphone jack and expandable storage? Sorry oneplus you cant take my money. üôÅ
Reginthala Mahesh	give away
Electro Power	iPhone is better!
Dorian Schulz	I'm still quite happy with my OnePlus 6, it's great, but if I had to choose now, I would happily take the 6t

Shubham Upadhyay	Top not notch.
Lebone Mokae	Amazing phone. Can't believe how much cheaper these phones are compared to the Samsung Galaxy and iPhone.
Std Isd	One minute of silence for all those who bought the OnePlus 6 üòÇüòÇ

RAW asshitshow	This phone is trash
FishBee Productions	Now we're talking! My oneplus 3 is getting nervous watching this video.
Matthew Leibowitz	I was waiting for this phone to be released. The only downside is the death of the headphone jack. I've been stuck on my  Iphone 6s for over 3 years so it is finally time for an upgrade, and the 6T is it!
leon steve	Where can i get that wallpaper ??
markatkinson167	Won't ever buy a phone now without a front speaker
Alen Chacko	Is the notification LED still there???
Schantzee	OnePlus phones are a no brainer for me.  Little bit worse camera and no wireless charging but $500 cheaper than their competition.  For people who don't lease phones from carriers, there is no better option than OnePlus for new phones.
Hex	Definitely my next phone
Random Stuff By Andrew	I was actually considering buying this phone, until i found out no headphone jack, and no wireless charging :(
Jordan	Wireless charging? No! Headphone jack? No! Sd card? No! Notch? Yes!  Edit: Stereo speakers? Of course not!

ODA Media	Nice dolly-tripod move @ 1:10Lol
Rohit Sinha	02:16 How can you complain about this notch dude?
Scott G.	The OnePlus 6 started at $529, not $549. The 6T is also thicker, not the same size as the 6.
bonam sharathsai	I don't know why but you don't go for an in depth review of Huawei flagships. They have pretty tempting features compared to others right. I mean their dxo score,charging speed on the mate 20 and all. Please do a brief review on that thing. I would love to see that coming from you.
J D	no headphone, mid-range to high price tag. The flagship kil....I mean, the flagship.
DemonikJD	I've been using wireless headphones for a while. I honestly have never once missed the headphone jack. Rarely if ever do i charge and use headphones wired at the same time, genuinely think people made more of a deal about the headphone jack just because Apple ditched it first and people loovveeeeeee to hate Apple
Adolf Hitler Archangel 88	Which fast charging is better 6t or the 5t
Romnys Gonzalez	Why someone wants 200+ GB on a phone? Dislike not enough Matte black
Kalpesh Shinde	do the review of xiaomi mi mix 3 its a really good looking phone
Erwin Tjia	No headphone jack?     Bye-bye Oneplus.
Nikhil Gupta	Idk why but your voice is kinda high pitched in this video. I had to like decrease the volume. It got really annoying. Never happened before.
Manjot singh	Headphone jack rip sucks
Jae Jackson Jr	Finally no headphone jack leave stupid Samsung n lg to keep that old thingüòÇ MORE BATTERY PLEASE
Baba Yao	"You are greatüòÇüòÇüò†.."
bimmer	MATE 20 PRO. BEST PHONE ON THE MARKET TODAY.
Tom	Finally they kept the price the same without slowly increasing it year after year, shame about the headphone jack though. I'll stick to my OnePlus 5t, still rapid.
Shawn Of The Flynn	These phone are gonna sound more and more like algebra equations down the line LMAO
The Inventar	Like For EMINEM'S KAMIKAZEEE!!!!!
Kaby	Removal of the headphone jack is an immediate no. It was one of the things that made OnePlus stand out where others still insist on copying Apple's mistake. I want a headphone jack, no dongle.
Denis M	Why do all android phones still have a chin? Does Apple have a patent on the chinless phone or something?
Raghvendra Ravi	RIP Headphone jack üòü
imicca	OnePlus 6T has  Same Snapdragon 845 Same 6/8GB RAM Same Camera Same no Wireless and IP6X Same $550, but pay again. Same NOT STEREO speakers. Not same headphone jack. Not same, slower in-screen scanner, ok... worth it?

Rodrigo Jara Piccardo	You seem bored
Lance Ryder	Is that a Casey Neistat merch?
Aaron Moiche	See now THAT‚ÄôS how you do an incremental upgrade, apple needs to learn to listen to the people, I‚Äôm sure OP fans are already throwing their money at OP even if they have the 6. These guys are onto something and they‚Äôre learning, they‚Äôre learning fast
Wazih Sharar	I almost considered upgrading to One Plus 6T but when lack of a headphone was mentioned, I'm back to square one.
Meh	Now that a top notch.

Omkar Poshatwar	Liked before even watching the video!
shashank	Talk about pixel not about iPhone as they suck
Samuel Mateo, Jr.	I don't know about anybody else but I hate the fact that for both the face id and on screen fingerprint reader you have to awake the phone in order to use them. With the old FP all you have to do is place your finger on it and its open. I hate the extra step. Waste of a step.
vashisht kant	Why everybody is increasing the screen size, it's so uncomfortable to hold, i like the screen size around 5 inch
Marco L√ºtticke	Great phone, but too expensive in Germany. The S9 costs less then 500 and it takes like 4 to 5 months until the mate 20 pro will be around 500. The Mate 10 pro is sold by big carriers for under 400 here...Sad stuff
Sadanand Raut	Love you brother
Dev Chhaniyara	What happened about that iPhone XR giveaway?
zord general98	I still think op 5 and 3t were perfect op.
Sagar Mathers	Luck you is the best track from Kamikaze
Gregory Thye	I personally think the curve/slope design with the notch helps the notch be less obtrusive and more intentional looking. Kinda how others can that design language and put it with their notches.
ShuShu2Sugary	what's dat wallpaper at the back
Jian Wu	128gb for the same price as last model deserve a huge praise
Bob Ruis	Cool phone. Started using bluetooth headphones so no headphone jack doesn't bother me. Would buy 100%
Rohit Sharma	OK. So you left oneplus 6 & switched to pixel 3 although it has a huge notch & bottom chin. & now you're saying that you switched to oneplus 6t who is nearly identical to OP 6 except teardrop notch & slightly bigger screen.  *Are you doing partnership with oneplus?* ü§î
johnmonk66	Design leaks? Every phone looks the same, let‚Äôs stop talking about innovation when they all are copies of each other. Innovate me a flip android phone, innovate me a phone with a slide out real keyboard, innovate me with a fat phone with a fat battery.  Otherwise all these phones are the same, all slaves have the same looking phone, good little followers.
Himanshu Chamoli	Still Note 9 remains the champ of specs

Ishan Sharma	Hey. I got the IphoneX in June, but now after updating it to IOS12, the colors in the camera fades when I take a picture. PLEASE look into this. Waiting for your reply.
Dwayne Zimmerman	I see you have the AT&T SIM in the 6T. Can you confirm that wifi calling or VoLTE work on AT&T on the OP6T?
Blaine Peoples	Really wish they had stereo speakers.. I could go without wireless charging but still.
Sunny Jeevan	Awesome mobile and super specifications
Rasmus	Should I wait for the 7 or nah? Decisions decisions...
Mikey gonz	If there gonna have a notch, that's exactly the way it has to happen
BjarkeDuDe	Shiiet OnePlus just overtook LG for me personally. I really love the wide angle cameras on LG phones, but all these things one the 6T 100% make up for the lack of a wide angle camera.
Ramkrishna Joarder	can i have the wallpaper?

Teghwin Singh	I love the new 2:1 aspect ratio. Feels more like 2018 style.üî•
White Green	You HAVE TO check out the Mi Mix 3. Then you know how is it hard for people OUTSIDE the U.S to find the right budget flasgship with the likes of xiaomi, honor, huawei, asus and finally oneplus cuz in my country oneplus is very expensive compared to the brands mentioned.

Manjunath Hegde	Hey Jack, come back!
Raz ÿßÿ®Ÿàÿπÿµÿß	Waiting for the s10.üòç
Nick Santa ana	Pretty glad I bought the OnePlus 6 right before the 6T. As nice as the 6T is, there isn't too much of a spec bump. I personally value the headphone jack because I use wired IEMs on a daily basis. I'm also pretty sure I'd lose the dongle in less than 5 minutes if I had the 6T lol. Sure, the 6T isn't too much more expensive but the 6 has been more than enough for me.

MrWhiteman De-F	OnePlus has done a perfect job this time again but I'm sad they got rid of the headphone jack. I wish the oneplus logo and the mute key was red for it to start out but for what they have done this time is an A+
Jonas Magnusson	If I had money it would be my next phone lol
TheBournPL	I need to make sure that my carrier supports it since it's not listed on OnePlus's site and buy it instantly
I_THE_ME	Hey, it's Oppo R15 Pro with SD845!
Lance Bell	Mi Mix 3 or this I'm torn.
David Ransom	That's upsetting to see the headphone jack go, especially from OnePlus. And now that the G7 is at or around the same price point, how would you say the two compare in day to day use?
Yolo Piop	That is how you make a midranger
Ras	Really good phone with fair price,I like it (wallpaper too).
Liston Fermi	4:20  Exactly!! I experience it in my OnePlus5T.  Though it is unlocked by finger unlock  it shines at full brightness.
Adam Rebel	As trash as it has always been.
bungofficiel	I want your t-shirt!!!
Niem iL	Why people like the headphone jack? I mean... having less options is better, right? MORE MONOPOLIES PLEASE
Schuyler Allart	Are you planning on doing a Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review? Can't wait to see that!

Akash Barman	Glad you got 18:9 content, already very tired zooming to fill...! Casey neistat merch alert!!
Dino Katana	This  is the only android phone that i would use if im not Iphone user!To be honest,in my opinion this is the best phone overall in the world,even better then iphones,especialy because for this price Oneplus is giving almost everything to us with very less compromises.And please STFU regarding headphone jack,if you need it go for Samsung or LG but hurry because very soon they will also remove it.
Ajay Narayan	Dont forget to include it for blind testüòµüòµ
Riza Rahim	Where do i get that wallpaper
Polaris007	No headphone jack no purchase
atul rao	The Casey Neistat Tee <3
Ashwin0095	1st?
Programming Wizard	Beast
Jarne Van Bogaert	By removing the headphone jack, the speaker got bigger, but is it any better or louder than the previous phones? Or is it just the same quality, but now twice as big?
I. Fawzy	I think getting rid of the headphone jack for an indisplay fingerprint is the worst decision and the worst trade off can any company take. Especially one plus who say that they listen to their customers. I think no headphone jack + no wireless charging is a fair deal breaker to me.
yanksrock1000	If i went back to Android, this would be the phone.
Juuso Vaakanainen	Just tap in your fucking passcode at night?     Big deal..
Vikas Sahu	Hey wallpaper link??? PLZ

vishnu nath	Awesome üëåüòç
TheLowerBeat	I would prefer this kind of fingerprint sensor. With the one on the back I have to lift up the phone every time it's on a table and I want to quickly unlock it
Adam Macias	He's so excited he said forget the Impressions. I agree with quite a bit of what you said, One Plus is making amazing moves in their company but they got to be careful not to go too fast with specs or features like the screen unlock feature to make compromises in getting rid of other features people probably cared more about like the headphone jack. Also, at 5:01.. I see real recognize real!
That Guy	I hope by the time I can use my student discount renews, they'll release a red 6t
Nathan Schmidt	Oh yeah, definitely getting it, just have to decide to go thru the Site or the Tmobile store. Tmobile is giving you $300 off if you trade in an approved device and my Samsung S7 is listed, so yeah. Man it looks really good.
Theo Filter	I don¬¥t know if I should switch from Apple to Android... So i have an iPhone 6 now and I want to Upgrade and I would get the new OnePlus 6T or the iPhone XR but the price difference is about 300$ and thats much but I don¬¥t know it is to switch to Android because I like it that the iPhone gets Software updates for such a long time and on Android this isn¬¥t the Case. So what so you think???
Saurabh Sinha	yo nigga send me an 1 niggabyte model
Ryan W	no its not miner the bright light in the dark i dont like that
Austin Hickey	So you can make a 6T review the day it comes out, but the XR review is still nowhere to be seen?

NAVED MEER	Apple is very smart it brings technologies which are very practical . And every one tries to copy or improvise . Face id is more accurate than the on screen fingerprint. Its been 2years apple removed headphone jack and one plus is doing it now ..
filipezellopt	Do u dont miss a oled screen in this phone?
Inertia Theory	1:52 rgb camera? So what does it do? Does it look at the colors of your face and say if your black, cmon in, but if ur white, no sirrrrie! ???      I'm serious.
Deepak Nn	16:9 ratio pls  we can't zoom in old displays
Sunil Aralikatti	One plus are known for their hardware. Removing headphone jack is a weird choice by them. This phone doesn't warrant a update if you already have 5t or 6.
Abdullah sharif	2:1 üñ§
Preet Mehta	I wish it was my next phone
Ezaz Ahmed	Honestly i still prefer physical fingerprint sensor this on display fingerprint tech sounds nice but kind of awkward they could have been left the fingerprint on the back of the phone that would have been much better otherwise its a good phone without the price sorry to say i cant take same sd 845 same previous gen camera at 549$ thats a deal breaker for me using 3t since it was released now the company becoming the next Apple i wish they go back to their flagship killer theme on the pricing
Raja Vignesh	But it's way much better than the S upgrade from a specific brand ü§£ü§£
Virgil's Utopia	No headphone jack = no sale
alenn mosses	R.I.P iPhone XR üòîüò≠üò¢  üòÇüòÅ
sidd wann	OnePlus 6 or OnePlus 6T which one is a smart buy?
21st Century FOX	OP 6t >iPhone XR
Navin _Visuals	In glass finger print sensor is awesome
Kuncen RIG	They shoulda waited and go with OnePlus 7 instead I mean this design with SD8150, DDR4x/5, UFS 3.0, LTE Cat 20, X50 Modem, and Oxygen 6 and 600$ 'll sell like hotcakes
GEOMAZ	The one plus 6T may not be a flagship killer but it's definitely the notch killer!
Soumak Nandi	*NICE SHIRT*
kaif iqbal	tons of notifications about Oneplus 6t review.. but i know which one i should click onüòâ Honest review üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Teksas Teksasen	2:1 still looks ugly. Love you tho
ahmad gz	Thanks for the aspect ratio , fits the s8 nicely
Fernando Castillo	5:02 good taste in music
Pratik Potdar	In background there is something noise ü§î
momo	Rear finger print scanner > stupid slow n insecure front underscreen
Hugo Achraf Dz	Absolutely Better than iphone xs üòâ
Belgianbadger	"Incremental upgrade" but loosing the headphone jack? Isn't that called a downgrade?
aB	Ok... So Vivo can create a fully bezel less phone that rocks an in display fingerprint scanner, a 4000 mah (bigger than 6t) battery and still manage to keep the headphone jack. GG.     And btw, one plus is like pubg mobile. They are super dependant of their promotion in the Indian market. The absence of the jack just straight up killed this phone.
JPeace116	You should grow a beard
Sorin Gaspar	OnePlus The Best Choice!
KmkzAtk	Rip swipe down gesture
Ameen 0v0	What abt the speakers ü§îü§î
Anish Somawar	Headphone jack, can you please return bro?   We miss you a lot!
FunziesGuy	Won't the new fingerprint technology cause a circular burn-in mark since it's OLED?
Wal Does	Samsung : HEADPHONE JACK, NO NOTCH, MEMORY CARD SLOT. Low range, Midrange, Flagships.  And Note 9 : 4000mah battery, headphone jack, stylus...  OP6 T : 3700mah battery, and no headphone jack.
Jesus Solis	Crazy how cheap this is compared to the quality of the phone
galaxy andromeda	Yeah my phone has the fingerprint scanner behind not on the front and I think it is much faster than on the front
PRANTO GHOSH	What do you feel like after seeing OnePlus include your 'Why I don't use the Pixel 2' video in their keynote?
Justine Arcilla	Yes
Adwaith Anil	üòç
Mohammed Thufail	Rip to jack and Jack sparrow, both beloved jacks leave from our beloved series!
Anikate Rajiv	It can definitely be my next phone, all I need is $549.
Diego Rovaglia	Lol, getting a 1+6T ad before this video
ulfath fazeer	What about the speakers ??
Will Gordon	wallpaper anyone?
Johann Nel369	Nah bruv, already pre ordered the Mate 20 Pro, better RAM management and the battery life is better thanks to the bigger battery and AI enhancements. Also I like ti have have a 1440p screen
Alex conilias	But sumsung can fit an S pen expandable memory and still have a headphone jack
Jovon Young	Im still happy with my pixel 3 XL dual speakers. The glass finger print scanner isn't that great for me. If I'm driving (not safe) I like to unlock my phone holding it with one hand, and it feels more natural with a finger tap in the back (for me). If I had an in glass finger print reader I'd have to either take my other hand off the steering wheel to scan my left thumb or awkwardly hold my phone flat with my four fingers, and press down with my thumb if I wanted to use one hand. Most ppl don't have big hands like is Marques lol. I like to grip with a free finger in the back to unlock ‚úåüèæ
Mario J.	No notification led? üòØ
Xsauce	the best phone of 2018 best specs best design best price thmbs up oneplus
Rijan Dhakal	I have the six and I am super happy with it. The last OnePlus phone to have a headphone jack, damn that feels like the end of an era. But OnePlus has slouched on its promises, this phone is for the  practical folks.
Aniss KAIS	Must be crasy to buy a pixel 3/3xl now that op6t crushes it on every way
Sanket Patil	That Casey neistat custom t- shirt is nice üî•
Think Create Done Productions	Love the 368 shirt! ;)
Andrew Griswold	Is it my next phone? Not likely. The Xs (smaller) will be my next phone on deck. That doesn't mean I don't think OnePlus is a great option. I have been lucky enough to play with the 5, 5t, and 6 in early testing and its easily my favorite Android based phone on the market right now. The innovation and way they chat with their audience in such a way to really build upon their successes and failures is just stunning.
Sangeet Khatri	With the headphone jack now gone, OnePlus's should change their tagline from "Never Settle" to "Settle a bit".
sGChetters	what widget/app is that on the second screen of the phone? does anyone know??
Pieter Dirix	The removal of the headphone jack is an absolute deal breaker and I lost all respect for oneplus
Bamrah	Rip headphone jack !
Humberto C	Hell yeah thanks for updating that screen resolution!
Prasanth S	Most hyped phone so far
Paco	Is that wallpaper from Firewatch ? :o
Karthick	Love for OnePlus
Rae M	I was going to wait for the 6t to come out to buy one until I heard they were losing the headphone jack. Bought a 6 and I'm very happy with it. Just not ready to start using BT headphones all the time or deal with a dongle.
Xotill Arafat	Nice phone
iBertz	Just call it "widows peak", just in time for Halloween üéÉ

Vin Wilson	This would kill LG G7 one.Its not as good and cost $600
vincent jean	Haven‚Äôt been as hype for a oneplus phone since the the first one. Can‚Äôt wait üòä
Deepak Kumar	Thank God.. My approximation was right.. They are really going with the shitty camera and in display fingerprint which is way slower than the physical one.. Happy to get Pixel 2 Xl at ‚Çπ35k.. Awesome camera.. Fp is not an issue at all... And software is Always best..  Oneplus 6T.. From my side is  not worthy upgrade at all.. They just keep making their phones fast and latest with the technology.. But they forgot the basics.. ü§®ü§®
Allen Nerona	I don't like the notch and why did they get rid of the headphone jack üò£
Sunil Sundaram	Can you start making 60fps videos? Come on, it's 2018.
HRaimov	Can I trade in my iPhone 8 plus product red for a 6t pls?
Demon King Dabura	As a OnePlus 6 user,only one thing hurt me Extra Storage at the same priceüò¢

Andrew Darrow	Only thing I don't like is the Cartman-esque bragging about 5G phones...but not making it a reality.  Don't tell me what is coming soon, I want to know whats here now....but yes... I want this phone!
oneworldvideo	No headphone jack, no deal.
Raoul Frissen	Great early review Marques! Think i'm gonna stuck a little while longer to my normal OP6. In my opinion not Worth the upgrade. Ps: do you have a link for the amazing wallpaper you are using in the video? Cheers
Archit Chandra	Does Techtober is over now?
Hardik Salian	Dude!.. no link for the wallpaper! ?

Arun Prackash	i've been a happy 3T user for ~2 years. getting this as soon as it becomes available
Juan Carlos	where can i find that wallpaper??
Avihay Bar	no headphone jack = no buy
Joshua Kr√§ftner	Face unlock is more annoying than in-display fingerprint reader, if you enabled the unlock at night (I don't know the real name, but.. it will shine up the whole screen up to 100% white to lighten up your face for Face unlock.) But sure not better than the old fingerprint reader if you mind a dark environment.
BillUtah	I‚Äôd rather have kept the headphone jack and the rear finger print reader.   For now, my phone will remain the S9 plus. Been all over the world and never let me down. Camera works great, performance is stellar, display is üò± and of course the headphone jack that requires no charging unlike Bluetooth headphones.   Thanks for the video, Bill
GOPI NATH	Wallpaper link plsüòÖüòÖ
Henry Healy	F for respects for the OnePlus headphone jack.

Rahul Dhiman	Which wallpaper app does he use ?.....  Anyone
GamerPDS	Not much of a upgrade from one plus 6 except larger battery and indisplay fingerprint scanner.
Mohammad Salman	Would the on screen fingerprint sensor work even when the display is completely turned off, or do you need to press the power button every time?
Suhail Khan	i so want this phone but at the same time can't buy it atm
Meedyom	Going to change from 3T to 6T

vishal bharadwaj	Same old crappy display since the days of op3t same full hd screen . same old stupid secondary lens which is most useless thing on this mobile . no IP rating, No headphone jack, no wireless charging despite having glass back, avg camera, no sd card only thing going for it is software or rather its speed and software updates. People should realise this . Its better to buy s9 which sales around 600 dollars in best buy or lg g7 which is 550 dollars or even pixel 2 xl . which are better value for money right now than this ..

aniket boy sawant	Nice sir i like this one plus 6t
AJAY JB	I think if it has fingerprint on the back as one plus 6, that could be way more better rather than under display optical finger print
Edward Sanchez Productions	great job on the review
Jad Yassine	At 2:13 the notification icons went up top. That's it. That's the only good way you can implement the hiding of the notch. Nice.
parapati	Had the OP1 and 3, and for sure will get the 6t
Daraul Harris	Does it have stereo front facing speakers?
Kemal Erhat	Excellent review as always dude. When my notification inbox is filled with reviews for the same phone at the same time, yours will be the one I watch. No bullshit, detailed reviews and slick video production. What more could I need.
wackojacko123	The amount of people here with their heads so far up Marques' ass is just a thing of wonder.
Duzx	Finally a front facing fingerprint scanner again. Headphone jack is a minor loss. I don't really use it anymore. Bluetooth headphones have such long lasting batteries that I rarely need to use the aux.
Vamsi Mohan Krishna Vadrevu	My beautiful 16:9 ratio, IPS, 4k monitor is not happy with the 2:1 aspect ratio video.

Dmitrii Taratuhhin	–ü—É—à–∫–∞ –≥–æ–Ω–∫–∞
ArKTeR	So... with their reasoning behind removing the headphone jack wouldn't that mean that as technology advances that it'll make a return in a few years when in display fingerprint readers aren't taking up much space?
Sceme1991	No headphone jack - no buy. Simple as that.
Salman Tipu	WoW Marques you gotta tell me where you got that T-Shirt. If anybody in the chat knows Please do tell.
Kashif Ahmed	Wow this phone is absolute beast...1+ give you the flagship phone but at the half price
Samuel Haber	This notch looks like an evil widows peak! (google it)
Amal Thomas	Finger print reader is too slow. The back one had an advantage, we could directly unlock the phone by touching the finger print reader, now we have to switch on the screen then scan the finger. More time, double work.
Christopher T	Nice shirt ! ;)
StplyZ	What a bout the sound?? Is it the same single downfiring speaker? Or double? How did you miss this detail Marques??
harjap bura	One plus 6 pro
Prapull	These "T" versions from one plus is just marketing strategy to earn. I suggest even one to wait for T versions instead of regular early year models of any given year.

Andrew Joy	No headphone jack..... your dead to me oneplus. The 6 and 6t are honestly a downgrade from the 5T. They did not have to put the glass fingerprint reader in thats just stupid.
Vishnu Raj	Just saying... I have the pocophone f1 ... And if your ready to give up that 6.4 inch amoled display .. then i would recommend you buy the pocophone f1 over OnePlus 6t...

Tathagata Derek Mondal	I didn't get it, you can't unlock the phone using fingerprint while the screen is off?
DANIELE TRICARICO	Great, great phone

TednTin	if there was no Mi Mix 3 then this would have been best of its class
Prakhar Mittal	they could've put the notification led in the  chin
Casuality	Nice video! Getting an upgrade finally from my OnePlus 3 this year, this thing looks great!
Bflo23	In the past, I don't think OnePlus charged tax from their online website in the past. Now with the phones being sold in T-Mobile stores, I am assuming tax will now be charged from their online website and that will be pushing the phone price to $597.43 for me.... Great phone but the price is steep for me.
Haja	still have the 3T. think I'm going to switch to the Pocophone, this is 200$ more and I don't get a headphone jack. 1+ is not sticking to their roots that much anymore
DankMemesDriveMe	I always get over 6 hours on screen time with my OnePlus 6, its pretty good!
Tetsuya R	This phone is a beast! Can you also do a review about the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?  Seems that phone is shipping with a wireless charger in box plus the hardware is pretty similar to the one plus 6t so a comparison would also be appreciated. Thanks.

me	What will the OnePlus 6's price going to be now?
Chesti Mudasir	MKBHD is a stan , Listening to Lucky You
Tech Dost92	oneplus 6t under fingerprint unlock speed is 0.34s Amazing but sad news is No 3.5 headphone jack
Rishabh Sukhija	Price is not same
Adam Lord	Where can i buy this phone?
Nitesh Rawat	First u have to press the unlock button then wait for a second placing ur finger on the screen ...to unlock ..are we moving forward or backward ...what if ur hands are sweating ...is finger print scanner works efficiently ...  And the main concern is u cnt just unlock the locked phone without pressing unlock button ..new step added
Martin Weber	Nice 368 T-Shirt ;)
Norris 90	It's not the same price
JayJay 100	was that 'peace' at the end intentional?
Tejas Sohoni	5:17 Jack The Ripper.
Stark Edison	Xiaomi MI MIX 3, pleaseeee!
KHD	Mi3 better
Chirag Parmar	Get back to 16:9 please
nwebservices	Just wanna point out that glass back (7:02) is not necessary for wireless charging.. I repeat glass back is not necessary for wireless charging.  Proof: Galaxy s8 active has fast wireless charging.
K.A.P. X	Unfortunately, I can never afford it. üòñüòñ
benjamin21	I love the 2:1 ratio it fits the Xs max  screen perfectly üëçüèº
Allan Unmatched	I swear the phone critic üî•üî•
ekam singh	That's a flagship phone for which we wouldn't have to sell our kidneys
prajwal Prasanna	I have a OnePlus 6....really want the T version now üòÖ
Tony Chiff	Is there any work around for getting this phone on Verizon?
sandesh saravanan	With that doubtful fingerprint scanner, patchy-at-night face unlock, death of Headphone Jack, and no upgrade to wireless charging..... I think now the Pocophone is a true Oneplus Killer....
Sean Jacob	Do you have to wake the phone with the power button every time you want to unlock it ?
GEC Industries	I guess im the only person in the world that when goes to bed charges and watchs videos with headphones at the same time.... I refuse to adopt this dongle madness.
Nogin Roblx	NYC.
RoughTide	Damn. Loving the 2:1 it looks so cinematic AND ITS A TECH VIDEO. Also I am on the Pixel 2 so 16:9 and it still just looks soooo good
ConLee	I honestly think the people who hate notches have never had one. Peoples diapers get full really quick when talking about it and it really doesnt matter
Jakob	I think the Notch just looks ugly
Rob Johnson	Love the aspect ratio of this video. I can full screen it on my XS Max without cutting off any content.
Manan Sayar	I am from India and i like PewDiePie. Fuck tseries
Labbazz	yes it is my next phone almost ordered one when you said the price is the same as the op 6... Also I have been rocking a op 3 for the last 2 years and a half :D
Rajput Abhijeet	How many noticed casey neistat merch.
Ajay Mohan	That was clean and dope review out there üòÇ ! As like always ! üî•üî•üî•üòç
Istir	Lucky you!
Janz 51	Glad that they didn't make the 6 feel obsolete, like the 5 to the 5T. Loving my 6!
Just A Fan	No Warp Charge?
Eduardo Gonzalez Jr	I'm just like ü§î and then ü§§.
Ethan John	With headphone jacks disappearing, I won't be buying anymore wired headphones. When Bluetooth technology is comparable I'll pick up a good pair of BT cans.
machine321434	A video that I can actually watch on my phone in full screen without zooming in and therefore cutting a large chunk of the video? What is this sorcery?
Sajjad Anwer	They should have keep the headphone jack.
michael	Trading in my LG G6 for the 6T! Especially because of that awesome up to 50% off deal
Rahul Ramesh	So.. top phone of 2018?
Vinod A.s	5g phone I am waiting
XaNe Rex	Techtoberrrrr
Bilal Ahmed	Can you do a camera comparison
AlexGetting	I was totally sold on the XR... but now I‚Äôm torn
Ateev Sharma	5G?
nmh5001	Interesting the Oppo R17, which is pretty much the budget version of the 6t, has the headphone jack. Is the extra 200mAh of battery worth losing the jack? I don't think so.
fragr33f	Favourite looking phone rn. The XRs back is pretty noice too.
Muffins	Are you sure about the screen on time figures because on a good day I can get 6 nearly 7 hours from my 5t which has the old less efficient snapdragon chip and of course a smaller battery.
MT AAs	Top and Bottom bezels aren't symmetrical. Stupid chin. Pass.
Radical Tech Reviews	I have the OnePlus 6 and I love that phone. This new refresh looks like a good upgrade plus at the same price, amazing. My one issue with the OnePlus 6 is the bluetooth, it doesn't work right. Have you tested the bluetooth of this phone. Try connecting it to your cars bluetooth and play some songs. Hopefully they fixed the issue the new phone.
syahbirin noor	Pass, not for me
Killacamfoo O.G.	WHERE IS THE HEADPHONE JACK??????????????????????????????
Cesar Alvarez	The cons of this phone are:  - Removal of headphone jack - Removal of customizable LED notification light - Less reliable fingerprint sensor
Varun Sarathy	Did he just "sponsored"?  O_o That's a first!
Julian Ing	Can‚Äôt wait for all headphone jacks to be gone so I don‚Äôt have to hear about it in videos years later since the discussion is over.
sgurung18	Sceptical of the new fingerprint reader... Not seeing the benefit...?
Whiz Tech	Get the MIX 3, next.
Agent 5H4D0W	And I'm still on the Samsung galaxy s3 *mini* with 480p quality and 4gb storage, plus half a gig of ram. Lasts about an hour.
Suhel Nadaf	Best reviewer on the planet.
adithya ganapathy	Should we press the power button to wake up first and then use fingerprint scanner ?
RockstarRohanMC [Gamer]	OnePlus 6T vs Mi Mix 3. Which one is good?
Mithical	So this is the face-lift of the OnePlus 6 then.
Sayak Das	Seriously a moment of silence üò∂
Angel Pacheco	Can't wait for Apple to copy the OnePlus 6T 3 years later
Maaz Khan	Nice
? ?	damn
Oren Eden	Nice video! Going to watch the exact same video with the same info on other channels. I don't know why.
Lynden Savage	not gonna pick this one up. have the 5T and it's great and can totally last me another year untill the 7T comes out. hopefully by then the camera will have improved a great deal and the finger print scanner will be on par with the physical ones now.
Vilen Evseev	Incredible video quality, men!
Usman Kamal	Why is no one talking about headphone jack?
TheSkyline35	Seems very good but as a very satisfied OP3 owner, the loss of headphone jack is a deal breaker
Danny Allen	Thank you for filling up my s9 screen üòÇ!
LIMMT republic	I need that Iphone XR shxt thoughüò≠
My Opinion	I will keep my one plus 6 I am not going to  change it cause 6t Don't come up with massive changes both are same
Terabit Tech	No headphone jack + notch = RIP OnePlus 6T for me. I'll buy Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, as Global MIUI 10 is probably one of the best (if not THE best) official skin for Android, removes the jack but adds a new design with no notch.  Sticking to my Xiaomi Mi A1 for a little bit longer, I guess  PS: I love the new 18:9 videos, although I feel you should get as far as 19.7:9 so that 18:9 users can just crop in.
Premsai Reddy	Put a link for  the wallpaper on the phone
R S	Your video wasn't recommended
The Film Maker	This phone is so disappointing
shravan dhadiwal	You seem pretty non excited for this phone
Khitish Agrawalla	Fast and smooth 'mantra'.....üëçüëç
Ram Dubey	I use iphone 7 and i hate 2:1 videos
viral videos unplugged	Its vivo v11 pro improved
Angel Hernandez	All this technology and time went to get rid of that notch and It still has a big ass chin smh
Josip Udovicic	I have a question? Op6, Op6T or Google Pixel 3?!
Leo Brooklyn	OnePlus slowly going mainstream  kinda sad
basith	First flop from oneplus
Kaushal Choudhari	I hate the aspect ratio
sandeep jacob	Samsung is always the best when it comes to customer response. They know what the users want unlike apple which forces their users to something that they don't like.
Abel Van Grevenhof	Omg love that phone i am pumpedüòçüòçüòç
Isht Deol	Are you using the nova launcher? What is that callender widget
Chris Thompson	What happens if you get a scratch on the screen right over the fingerprint reader? ALSO: what is that round lamp with the geometric base behind you?
Freed Gorilla	meizu is another one maintaining the headphone jack
Adrian Moon	Rip pixel 3 for me even the camera can barely save it against the one plus 6t
Mayank Rathod	I don‚Äôt like oneplus... it‚Äôs get too hot when gaming!
c137	got a pixel 3 ad on this nicee
Ren√© Albrechtsen	Definitely getting 6t next.
ravi kiran	Did you changed your mic...it's crispier than your last video
Anime Invader	I think it's same as Huawei Mate 20 Pro. Just the change is that 3 camera setup
Jay Patel	When did u start using the 6t??
Yamin Shaikh	Head phone jack noooo
Naor Shiri	It is my next phone
VETTE	I wouldn't get this because they ditched the headphone jack
David Matheus	Yes its my next phone
Sapgasm	No wireless dash, no dual speakers, have to press power button before use of fingerprint sensor, huge disappointment.
Tube Of Noob	Well..looks like Samsung is the last brand to use the headphone jack.
Kenny 92	you know ...I shouldn't be surprised that this review is already up, but I'm always still shocked at the speed lol
VLOG SHLOG	Nah waiting for OnePlus 7 or 7t
Charlie_Joy	Someone buy me this phone
Shantanu Z	This thing is sick!
patstar5	Never thought about that issue with the in display fingerprint scanner.... Guess they could make the rest of the screen black except for that part. I can't stand people who use phones at max brightness at night.
—èŒ±s—í	Disappointed No headphone jack No LED notification And they are saying we listen to the community, u listen to f***ing ur self
Nic H	Doing the notch right, got that finger print sensor under the glass, near stock android experience, cameras seem good (enough), price still lower than most (if not all) flagships, design is on point. Serious contender for phone of the year I would say.
STAN lee	2:24 isn't it surface area?
shresth vir	First
David Xing	seriously , I feel like oneplus has been settling.  I wrote a review of the 6 stating all the obvious problems, and the 6T corrected none of them: still no dual speakers still no better camera sensor, I was hoping for at least an IMX363 and dreaming for the IMX586. still no wide-angle or telephoto secondary camera still no passive cooling design like a heat pipe still no DP/HDMI over type-c still no infrared camera for face unlock headphone jack removed for merely 12%more battery still way more expensive than the MI 8 still no IP67/68 dust and water resistant as a OP3 and a OP6 Avengers Edition user, I am recommending OP6T to no one.
Dhruv Thakur	Casey's Merch , üòé ü§ò

ram kishore sharma	Buying this on doesn't make any sense !!! I am happy with 6
Faaz Fadhil	Rip headphone jack.. üò™ I hate op6t because of no headphone jack..  Who else ?
Siddhartha Verma	OnePlus lights your face to unlock the phone. The screen becomes super bright and the phone is able to detect your face.   And damn that's irritating during the night. I can hardly open my eyes and the phone doesn't unlock. And now the same shit with on-screen FP. C'mon OnePlus. They said they don't stick to gimmicks, but Screen Unlock is basically, just a gimmick especially when you compare it to the usability of the 3.5mm jack which btw is very important to most of the people!
Jarrett Edwards	Still think I‚Äôm going with Pixel 3 XL over this. Honestly don‚Äôt understand why people whine about notches so much. It hasn‚Äôt bothered me at all any time I‚Äôve used the phone. When people complain about notches it kind of just sounds like they‚Äôre being snobby and nitpicking.
Saurabh Rane	Hey one question Did you know before hand that your video clip is going to be featured in the launch Event :) !!!??
Ben Stef	Thanks for the 6 things about the 6T
rDnhey	Nah, I keep my Pocophone, 4000mh and still has jack. Let's see what 2019 get
Henry Tran	Battery ‚úî Screen ‚úî 128 GB ‚úî Fast charging ‚úî Software ‚úî Tear Drop Notch ‚úî Camera ‚úî Price ‚úî  Take my money
Vassiliy Kravtsov	Sad about the headphone jack.   Also that Tesla m3 shot is just awful. Like what the hell happened there. The quality is so bad. Looks terrible.
Heinrich Beck	I already picked up the Pixel 3 XL. For me, the benefit of Project Fi (using Google as my cellular provider) outweighs any notch, or any other criticism of the phone. But I owned the first OnePlus and it was a tank of a phone.
Rohan Sawant	Anyone got the wallpaper?
Rudraksh Gupta	wallpaper?
Noobies	That's a no buy! Should Call it One Minus 6 ...
Kalyan M	Why are companies switching to in-display fingerprint sensors? I don't see a point. Standard sensor at the back is more comfortable, much faster, and allows swipe down gestures for notification bar which is super useful especially with these huge ass displays. In-display ones can stop working if you crack the screen. The notch on this phone is great. Wish they had pixel level cameras. Google won't be able to sell pixels then lol.
N√≠o fury	Seems one plus will become a tough competitor for apple
Doudymac	Looks good. But Mi Mix 3 is about to change the game. üòÅ
Delirium	2 birds with a stone lads , tho lots of you hate the fact they removed the headphone but are you saying you prefer an old tech over a new and futuristic one.Look they added a dongle , plus who tf will use a cable and listen together I mean mostly we are using it without charge
Aman Tahiliani	Rip 16:9‚òπÔ∏è
Techbyte	Everything is amazing in this phone except that they have removed 3.5mm headphone jack.. they r the only ones who r selling there phone at right price... really happy that they r selling 128 gb storage phone.. at just 549 !!!

davidS -arlod	Hey, Marques. What about the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?   I'd love to watch a video about it.
Jase	I don't think the notch is that bad, I actually prefer the teardrop shape than the essentials (maybe because it curves/flows into the borders). It's def not as offensive as the pixel 3xl.
Bastardo	lol this is more like a better budget phone,apple take notes
Carlos Martinez	I have a question. Does it have  accessibility for blind people and what operating system does  it  use? ? Please let me know because I am blind

Vikas Patil	Wtf America is one day ahead of India
Stine Jensen	Is this your next phone?  Oh god how I wish it was. I have an oneplus 6, and it's really great, but not as great as oneplus 6t seems. But I think I'm gonna buy bullets wireless in red and the red silicone cover (I have the nylon now) though. Great video like always!

Torin Shields	I was like 60% sure this would be my next phone but I happen to have had an LG G6 for the last 2 years and I also happen to be a T-Mobile customer so now I can $300 off a $549 phone that offers all this is literally a no-brainer like I don't see what could possibly stop me.

Akshay Suryawanshi	Atleast Linus was honest enough To Mention that the video Is Sponsored by One plus... 1+ needs  to promote their phone and buy biased reviews
Jenish Pala	Looks like OnePlus is in Peer Pressure üòÇüòÇ No Audio Jack...... I think this is onePlus' worst mobile in past 3years..... Won't sell much units in India....... people do not want Screen Fingerprint sensor..... People want a good camera and The Fuckin AUDIO jack...
Samida maharjan	i was waiting for this phone.. i am in love with the pricing and all.. the only thing that i kinda feel not good about is water proofing.. but overall can't wait till i get this new baby in my hands üòçüòçüòç

Owen wandy	Please can I have a oneplus 6T? ‚ô•Ô∏è
Prajjwal Laad	What's that calendar widget?
Dpak	screen unlock and no headphone jack üëé
Dion Tholen	It's not the same price tough is it? The oneplus 6 started at $529 for the 64GB model. The 6T starts at $549 for the 128GB model. So you still get double the storage for only $20 more but OnePlus has been driving the price up each year with $20-30. Not a good look imo
Tobias Grund	Wow I tought it can't be better but I was wrong. Here in germany the 8+128GB model is only 10 ‚Ç¨ more expensive as the 6 with 8+128GB. So this is very OK. By the way I love it, they threw out the headphonejack. :)
Savva Moser	I feel like OnePlus should stop with the two models a year thing and just stick with the "T" cycle.
Moldy Hunter	Who else is watching this on Nokia 3300????
Hrithik Jeet Sharma	Wallpaper??
Muzik l	For me I guess finger print sensor at back the still the best onee
Shady 7	Wallpaper??
Rohil Jain	Drawback of in glass fingerprint scanner that we need to press turn on and off button every time...lil inconvenient
Harish Bharath	IMO the indisplay fingerprint scanner is useless. I think they've had it just to show it as an upgrade and also because their sub companies have adopted it! Physical fingerprint scanners FTW! And they could have easily kept the headphone jack instead of telling us silly reasons like other companies. According to me the OP3 and 3T are the best OP phones ever!
Saad Kidwai	Nice. Can't wait for it to come to Aus. That Mirror black!
Harshal Maheshkar	I wanted to see your video first on ONEPLUS 6T.
Ankit Jain	Why they don't make it IP68 rating(Waterproof)?üòí

R. Batinic	That "no space" for headphone jack is such bullshit... But i guess average consumer dont mind having his intelligence insulted.
George B	How is the loudspeaker? Because it think on the 6 was pretty poor.
Ben Willock	This would have been exciting about a week ago before the Mi Mix 3 was announced.

Ark ozh	no headphone jack, no more oneplus. once break the trust, harder to gain back.
Louis Law Weize	He asked is this your next phone as if we're changing phones every 6 months ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Holip sism	Yes, Marques. This is my next phone!
Raymond Jones	Sad to hear about the headphone jack, it really is. The Oppo R17 has the same design, an in display fingerprint sensor, and still has a headphone jack! What about the battery? Remember when the OnePlus 3T got a 3400 MAH battery when the 3 only had 3000? They increased the MAH by 400 with the exact same chassis.   No one is really providing us with a transparent motivation as to why they want to remove the headphone jack. Other than that, this is almost a perfect phone. Great video as always.
Aleksandr Vysockij	Forgot to say "the same shit speaker". Honestly no damn given about the in screen finger print sensor, they start sounding like Samsung, pretending things are more important than they are. If Google allowed a secure enclave for facial recognition all phones would be copying FaceID which is superior in ease of use  in comparison to any fingerprint sensor. Honestly I love the company and their strategy but they seem to start making a big deal about things that really isn't a big deal (I have doubts everyone is racing to put the fingerprint sensor under the screen, if they were that'd have already happened, but it hasn't). For anyone that has $549 to spend there's clearly no better option, but I really wished for good speakers , and given the glass back wireless charging... After trying the 3T I'm back on iPhone and maybe one day OnePlus will convince me that it's worth leaving iOS and the ecosystem. But today isn't that day as while their performance seems superior, there's still lack of attention to smaller details that others have taken care of years ago
Lewys Cousins	I can't believe they used your video in their actual presentation it was so funny üòÇ
Carlos David Castillejo Flores	Where can I get that wallpaper?
Yi Hsing Lee	I think this notch is perfectly small and is a huge improve in design but the problem with unlocking your phone in darkness is really kind of annoying for me too. I get that it's a new fingerprint scanner technology but I gotta admit that it's a lot satisfying with lightning fast fingerprint scanner rather than this one. I've got a phone with infrared ray face recognition which is super fast and works perfectly in darkness as well so I kinda feel how important it is to have fast and reliable unlocking system.
Alez TehCat	I swear I'm buying this when I get the chance.

SavageFitness	Sold going to be my next phone for sure
Blake Forsyth	Why no Australian release? Buying flagship phones outright is just not worth it anymore. Almost all flagships (google, samsung, apple, huawei, etc.) are well over $1100+ for the cheapest/lowest spec option. It's annoying see other countries get better "bang for the buck" options when all we get is cheap crap or over priced flagships. I still believe that consumers shouldn't be paying more than $1000 for a phone that can last a minimum of 2-3 years before it spontaneously has a battery problem, bootloop, broken screen, or software issues.
Oliver Almonte	The shot @ 1:06 was dope

Umayanga Alahakoon	Honestly, the only october event which I was waiting (and still waiting) is tomorrow‚Äôs Apple event
Nguyen Dinh	RGB face unlock: an unnecessary marketing scheme and might put user at risk. Glass back w/o wireless charging, easy to break. Notch: sexy AF Fingerprint sensor: needs always-on outline so people can zero in on it while the screen is off
yilmanbabilonia	My only complaint about the OnePlus phones is their camera. I don't even try to take picture at night cause I know they are gonna suck and pretty much look like the pictures I used to take with a flip phone .
√ñmer Furkan Yal√ßƒ±n	This is not a review
Shiz The Snorlax	T-Mobile is gonna carry this? Omggggggg that is exciting. If only I didn't have a S9.

PARAM VERMA	Screen unlock has a drawback ,because if I have to unlock the phone firstly I press the power button then place the finger on that particular portion of screen. Previously we have to just place finger on physical fingerprint sensor only and it unlocks instead of pressing power button and then placing finger .
Mohd Azle	The flagship killer. But pocophone also flagship killer killerüòÇüòÇ! Nice one plus 6t

Muhammad Shahfikry	One day Oneplus in my pock
Unchained Spirit	Good upgrade, but I would still choose a samsung galaxy 9 or even 8 over it due to the lack of expandable storage and now the loss of the headphone jack. I loved the stock android experience but that‚Äôs not enough to make me choose this phone anymore.  Not to mention lack of water resistance which caused my OnePlus 3t to malfunction. What reason could there be for not including wireless charging? That‚Äôs the standard now!

Corn dawg	I was pretty much sold on this phone till no headphone jack.  Seriously, Manufacturers need to stop with that shit . It isn't innovative or cool just plain annoying
hamdi 33	Really this is such a great phone But lets talk truthfully this year iPHONE XS MAX is the KING of 2018
Samuel Feldman	how much do you think marques uses his headphone jack? I think it is unnecessary to have one. he only referenced "some people" when talking about removing it.
Bhaskar Gharu	this is my next phone..:)
Chief Fabio	is it me or is the audio funky?
Filipe Guarino	It's still awesome.. !

Arthur E'	I have a OnePlus 5T, for face unlock you have to go in the settings, at night it will work because it will illuminate the screen for 1 second and recognize your face.
Nick Aguirre	What's the speaker situation? They didn't even mention that in the keynote. Is it the same single speaker OnePlus always had?
KAMAL K V	Cool upgrade for same price.

Tar Daniel	You didn't mention, but I guess that fingerprint sensor is not always on...
carver 9	People was saying this is going to be the best phone of 2018. Humans are laughable species. Note 9 is still leading with Huwaie being numero uno.
Nganea Nangammbi	If you have an option of hiding the notch, why cant you just not include the notch at all
It's David	$550 for all that? And the only thing you sacrifice is the camera? Definitely worth it.

Mudit khanna	Wallpaper link?
Finlay Thewlis	Notch pun did not disappoint!
Arjun U	The one plus 6 will make more sense as it has the faster finger print reader and a headphone Jack and a cheaper price
Niranjan Rajesh	Dude where do you get your wallpapers from? They're brilliant. My OnePlus looks ugly compared to that üòÇ
Ciar√°n Jones	I bought the 6 on the weekend because I use the headphone jack everyday. The internals are pretty much identical. It would be nice if they continued the 6 after the launch of the 6t just so people have a choice of headphone jack or battery and inscreen fingerprint etc.
Datulab Tech	If it had a headphone jack, it would have been an instant buy. I will probably still get it though as this is the first notch design that I don't hate, with a price point that is much closer to my budget than a Samsung.

I love the software of the Pixel, but I can't find much to dislike about the 6T. The Camera of the Pixel 3 is my biggest draw in that direction, but the specs and battery of the 6T have me torn.

yacine gannouni	Please don't let me remind you againüò† we need some wallpapers bro ‚òπÔ∏è
Ido Gindes	Do you prefer the fingerprint scanner under the display instead of the back of the phone? I think the back one is both faster and more comfortable because of how you hold the phone.

Rock Head	Definitely not worth the update if you have the One Plus 6
Shona Baroi	I guess most commenting here have no idea about Mi Mix 3 launched a couple of days back. Check that. This will look shit in front of that. This looks like a budget INR 12000 Realme 2 Pro.
VaMpInGs	I got the OnePlus 6 and I love it but now I want this (not gonna buy it tho)

Muhammad Mahdin	This phone is pretty boring and unoriginal. We've seen that kind of notch and an in display fingerprint sensor in many phones now. Very very dissapointed in one plus about the removal of the headphone jack. EVEN THE NOTE 9 WITH A STYLUS AND A 4000MAH BATTERY HAS IT. SAHME ON ONE PLUS.

Marten van der Meer	Hey @Marques, I've yet to hear anyone talk about the bottom firing speaker. Is it the same as the 6 as well? I see two grills there, but are they both housing (a) speaker(s) or is one of them purely there as a housing for the microphone? :) Was hoping for a slight upgrade, as I'm used to my Nexus 6P!

NEWS FOR YOU	Subscribed me
Tim R.	Not a single f***** word about the removal of the headphone jack in the whole keynote. They removed the headphone jack because of the community? Purest bullshit ever. And if they wanted the finger scanner and a bigger battery, they should have made the phone THICKER and NOT removing features!  "5+ hours screen on time" also does not sound that good. I can get up to 7h with my V30 EASILY. With a higher res screen and only 3300 mAh.
Michael B	Looks pretty good honestly.
nboejui	Under 100
mahavir degaonkar	Hey MKBHD we have seen you at oneplus 6t launch event.
Yusuf Imran	i see from the look of marcus, he's already getting boring in the phone league industry & maybe i think one day he will come out his own phone brand, despite he already well known in phone industry & with the phone brand big bosses, what a hype phone it will be by  represent the name 'MKBHD' phone. must be a hit!
