Case in point: the Democratic Primaries of 2016. What, are you surprised that some of us are still pissed off about this? Damn right we are! I was a Democrat since the first day I could vote. And yet, despite having grown up as a Child of Reaganomics, despite their numerous attempts to vote away my access to the Means of Survival, despite their numerous attempts to legislate me out of existence (as a transwomen), it wasn\'t Republicans who radicalized me into being a Socialist. Why not? Cause I expect that sort of evil and corruption from them. But the Democrats, I thought for years that they were better than that. In 2016, I watched the DNC and the DCCC try to ram Hillary Clinton down our throats... a candidate who loses popularity everytime she opened her mouth, a candidate who was so corporate that I could scarcely tell the difference between her policies and the bullshit politics of Reagan I grew up with! In one key state after another, I saw the DNC meddling and engaging in all sorts of political fuckery, like voter suppression and poll closings.

That said, I still voted in the general election DESPITE all this. True, I didn\'t vote for the candidates of either party, but went third party (because at least the Greens weren\'t wholly owned by the corporations). But I can understand why so many pissed-off Democrats chose not to vote. I voted out of sheer outrage, in a pyrrhic attempt to show the candidates in question the level of contempt with which I viewed them. You, Barry, sat by and let the unravelling of our democracy take place. You have no grounds to lecture us all on the importance of voting.

Most shameful is that all along you talked about our ideals, our values, our freedoms.

Here‚Äôs Kevin Drum‚Äôs list of GOP misdeeds:\n\n‚ÄúAs a sort of PS to my post yesterday about the decay that‚Äôs overtaken the Republican Party, I‚Äôd like to make clear just how long this has been brewing. I know this is hardly news to anyone who reads this blog, but as I approach my 60th birthday I can say that half my life has now been marked by Rush Limbaugh, the Drudge Report, Newt Gingrich, the Vince Foster suicide, Whitewater, the Rose law firm, Filegate, the Christmas card list scandal, Fox News, Monica Lewinsky, impeachment, the Florida recount, Swift boating, the GOP‚Äôs partywide effort to suppress black votes via photo ID laws, birtherism, the unanimous Republican rejection of the 2009 stimulus, Benghazi, Emailgate, Merrick Garland, and now the endless haze of racism, bigotry, and corruption surrounding Donald Trump.\nThis is very much a non-exhaustive list. But every one of these things is either a baseless ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù an example of ethical rot, or part of a deliberate media effort to lie and mislead. These are the highlights of the Republican Party over the past three decades. No political party with a rap sheet like this deserves to be walking around free.\n‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/08/30-years-of-moral-decay-a-short-history-of-the-republican-party/?utm_source=mj-newsletters&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=in-the-mix-2018-08-11', 'JJ Walter': 'Maybe we would get more voters if it was clicking likes and dislikes.
