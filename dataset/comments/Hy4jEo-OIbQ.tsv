Jasmin B	Can’t he see that Kris is uncomfortable about his father being the topic? Like seriously? Is he insensitive or what? 🙄
Bianca Nava	One thing that I really loved in this interview is that kris corrected the interviewer saying that there was 12 members in EXO 😭❤️
文溪溪	心疼凡凡 笑着回答主持人他最不愿提及的事

Harlow	SUPPORT TALENT SUPPORT KRIS. STREAM ANTARES.
Jongin's Black Hair	I'm so mad the interviewer keep asking him about his dad again and again. He already say that they never meet. What kind of stupid question. He keep asking about Kris's dad? Can't you see Kris's face? Can't you see his eyes although he was wearing shades? Omg, he looked so sad. I feel I want to cry but at same time I was so mad at the interviewer.
kumaminyoongi //	LeAvE bAbY KriS aLoNe.  ALSO BITCH! NOT ALL OF US ASIANS ARE SHORT
Hannah Lee	this interviewer is so insensitive wtf.. i've never felt so uncomfortable watching an interview before. he sounds more like a therapist than an interviewer asjdksf did he really feel the need to ask sm personal questions?? he has no respect or common sense
Evelyn Santos	"okay"
Jannat Day	These are horrible and inconsiderate questions, how disappointing, no one should have to go through such a terrible interview.
Amanda J	This whole interview is so ridiculous. Kris looks so freaking uncomfortable. The pushing with questions about his dad is so unprofessional; learn some boundaries. And then he makes that stereotypical comment about his height being “tall for an Asian kid.” Come on, dude, show some respect.
mrspoynter2005	this interviewer though....shouldn't this interview be about him as an artist? these questions sound like he is on Dr Phil or something.
Brinnie	He feels uncomfortable when the interview asked him about his dad. I feel bad for Kris...

BtsVbae Exo.D.Ooppa	Cringe!!!
JYUNA 's	why the hell you want to make someone so uncomfortable by asking him a questions like that?
Alexandra Chavarin	Almost 3 minutes regarding somebody does't deserve the time or energy from Kris? anyways... I believe Dj Vlad could ask more about something else or show more interest in something else...anyways! Congrats Kris, keep doing what your doing!
EXO- L	Why is he asking a question about EXO? Cause Kris is not in EXO anymore! Kris and SM had very bad feelings... each other so he went back to China
Sofi sofiyyah	What an incredibly unprofessional interview. To continue asking him questions about his father when he’s expressed his discomfort physically, and egging him on for a reaction is SO messed up. Have you thought about your audience? Do you seriously think new fans, or existing fans of Kris, would want to see him unearthing trauma brought on by your highly unprofessional, invasive, poorly written, and poorly researched questions? Congratulations on making the WORST out of an opportunity to interview such an important figure of the Chinese music community. Instead of focusing on milestones like Kris’ album, his bridging of the East and West through music, and even his acting career, you chose to focus on the uncomfortable questions that clearly have no connection to his artistry. An awful travesty. Congratulations on exploiting the kindness and respectfulness of Kris while exhibiting absolutely no tact. Kris may not have said anything to your face, but I assure you, your unprofessionalism will warrant future celebs not being as kind to you. Your lack of self awareness and emotional intelligence is pitiful.
Athow besuto	6:22 (at that time ) ???? EXO still so big all over the world !!!!
Cartoon Character	Kris you took this interview well. Fuck the dad questions. You dealt like a boss. SWAG

KayLyda	SOOOO many questions about his dad. I thought Kris seemed excited at the start then when those dad questions kept rolling his mood was like meh.....And I just wished he could move past those questions.  Very awkward.
Htut Soul	Fack you -_- Not only Asian goes through divorce. The European kids goes through this too... What is so hard about this? There is clearly a question you shouldn't be digging around with Facker 🖕
21Blackjack	Poor kris I wanna hug him for being strong enough to cope with such a dick of an interviewer I know what it’s like to grow up without a dad so I understand how difficult it is to talk about that kinda thing

blossom m	I hate you interviewer you're so stupid...how did you even get this job
siti faizal	what the f*ck. What questions do you ask kris man. Please have some respect of him. It was too many personal questions.   Wu Yi Fan/Kris still relax and keep smile. But I'm almost cry here in the same time I'm very angry with the man.  Btw, fighting with your career kris. Exo-L always support and miss you. 😘😘😘
Gabriel Asaf	What stupid and invasive kind of questions are these? What the hell?
Only Love	Since lay debuted in ny will they run to each other often or rarely 😨?
CHO BY SUNSHINE	Seriously? Talking about his dad you are so RUDE. I don’t care that can keep everyone watch this clip, but this is his private story. You should respect to him and his family.

Dope Lee	never imaged Kris Wu could be interviewed, since this channel is all about Hip Hop, you see wut I mean?:)
sweet x lush	clearly it’s not just me who thinks this, but the interviewer seems very disrespectful. maybe kris agreed to talk about these topics, but it seems by the expression on his face that he was getting really uncomfortable.
yang hang	This is just deadass not a very good interviewer.
Angela Geeba	Mad respect for you Kris ❤️
Ya Yeet	Why is the interviewer so rude he was asking personal deep questions
BtsOnCrack	why tf is the disrespectful interviewer asking my baby such horrible questions about his father?
fantaestic taenologist .	*Too many dad questions!*
Pewdiepie's Hot Dog Boss	The interviewer is particularly interested in Kris's dad
Sario Galupo	Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
African ARMY	As an interviewer, you're supposed to make the guest comfortable enough to want to open up to you; You're supposed to listen to the guest. You set the mood and make sure the whole conversation flows. This interview is not it. It's really awkward; he keeps pushing certain questions that he clearly didn't want to answer or had already answered in a way. Just ugh!  But Kris did really well and he was open with his answers. You go boy
A 88	It would’ve been nice for the interviewer to actually do research on Kpop if he’s going to ask questions about it... “so you make it into this group but you’re not Korean” nooo way really? He’s not Korean?  “You learned how to speak Korean?” no shit nah he spoke Chinese and English in a country that speaks Korean in a group that performs and speaks purely in Korean.  “In the boy group were you singing?” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️  Also the interviewer just sounds plain patronising. He could be a great guy for all I know but  1. He’s not even in the shot which just makes him seem more condescending 2. He talks about himself way too much and stuff like how he just interviewed Jay Park and they’re so “similar” 3. He asks way too much about his dad like why would we need to know so much detail this isn’t a therapy session  4. Instead of just asking questions he poses them as “so when you were___ you did ___” like he’s some job interviewer reading a resume  5. It felt like he kept waiting for Kris to say stuff rather than him leading the conversation so Kris is just left there smiling awkwardly   I don’t know Kris Wu well but I can’t believe he just sat there and continued the interview. Must be a pretty chilled guy to deal with that.
Hopetobe Angel	Love him so much... For the interviewer don't ask like that, just respect him.... !!
Giuls CG	STOP WITH THE DAD QUESTIONS MAN HE DIDNT SEEM COMFORTABLE AT ALL, ARE YOU DUMB?! YOU SOUNDED LIKE YOU DIDNT CARE THE WHOLE INTERVIEW, YOU WERE LIKE “OKAY NEXT QUESTION” WHAT THE HECK MAN STOP
Doremia	literally the weirdest and unprofessional interview... please. the slight racism and sterotypes being thrown and the false "oh hey we're both immigrants" so we must relate spiel...
naya papaya	what the fuck? why does the interviewer keep pushing these personal questions about his dad?
sigh ferreira	no offense but this interviewer was terrible. suuuuper awkward/boring/pushy and it felt like he didn’t do any research on kris at all. yikes.
OSH Exo	I hate this interview !
jimin excuse me	I honestly don’t like this interview because the interviewer keeps on asking very personal questions about his life especially in the beginning
Lupe Hernanadez	TERRIBLE INTERVIEWER.  he kept pushing Kris to answer personal questions, like boi.
criesyoongii	I’m pretty pissed off about how freely the interviewer threw out the fact that his dad wasn’t in his life and was pushing Yifan to talk about it. What’s with the stereotypes about Asian height too though...... I’m gonna punch this guy in the face :)
林嘉文	超级帅
Jb Dontpanic	the interviewer... sorry you had to deal with this kris
Karina Valverde	take a shot every time he says yeah
mikeyjaynes92	This was wayyy too short and  I agree he shoukd have taken the hint to kove off from the dad questions. I've  seen his videos and interviews  before but never has he gone on like this to someone he is not close with at all?
Hope McGregor	agh I feel like the interviewer was too pushey  NO ONE ever asked me THAT many questions about my family and personal life
glazec4	Kris was a good sport, but y'all gotta get a new interviewer, he didn't do good at all.
Shafikah Irwan	There was a sad face on the happy face
Soft ChimChim	He is so uncomfortable 😣 Kris you didn’t have to force yourself to answer them 🙁
PROPERTY OF RAPMONSTER RAPMONSTER	The interviewer is awful!
wu bucky	stupid interviewer for sho
Elyse G.엘리스 지	wtfff this interviewer is wack!! so disrespectful! give kris a break jesus
krisssssten	This interviewer did the same thing to Jay Park on the topic of 2pm, like okay ask the first few questions, but after that you can already get the vibe as an interviewer that they dont want to talk about it and are uncomfortable 🤦🏻‍♂️
Exo My Aesthetic	I'm watching this for Kris, but this channel seems pretty disrespectful and pushy like other commentors have mentioned. They shouldn't have made him talk about his father and ask all those stupid questions.
Paul Chan	What TF questions? What s wrong with u people? SXXX show
GoodLuckNabs	Please take a look at my reaction to Kris' November Rain! <3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMSx6pvkuo4&feature=youtu.be
MaloneBeauty	What the actual fuck is wrong with this interviewer?? Ask him about his accomplishments and his music and what he likes and he wants to do..... good thing the interviewer is hiding his face !!!!!
_ mixhuu _	WTF IS WRONG WITH THE DUDE IN THE BACK ASKING THESE DISRESPECTFUL ASS QUESTIONS
maemae bahad	I don't like this interview. It was too personal. Kri's kept smilling but damnnn this interview is awful
헤나	There is part 2?? I hope u had better question to ask
Curry Zhong	0:55 Is he saying yes in chinese in the interview lmaooo
Kerry Castaneda	I think it was really personal when he asked if he would try to contact his dad. Not everyone is interested especially if his mom divorced him then that must’ve been a reason.
HaloRainne	Its an INTERVIEW not a THERAPY SESSION!!! Pressing him about such issues is so disrespectful and invasive! And then when you mentioned Jay -_-  you could have asked Kris if maybe he liked or knows Jay..? If they might want to collaborate or something...? But instead you compared their career pattern wtf. Don't get me wrong, yall, I love Jay Park...but like why..??? Jay Park and Kris Wu are not the same...omg this whole interview is a cringe fest! I feel bad for Kris...you could feel the discomfort and awkwardness through the monitor!
vaishnavi barthwal	This interviewed did my Kris dirty  😑 but Kris being the humble one that he is answered him calmly but I could see the hesitation in this eyes........
Amalia Hernandez	Kris wu being interviewed by the dumbest man alive?????
Tuna PCY	Okay.... This is not a freaking interrogation.
sokerisade	Everyone in the comment selection is complaining about the interview because ”the interviewer made him uncomfortable by pushing him to talk about his father”. Look, this comes from someone who grew up without a father too, someone who has only once met him and was too young to remember it, someone who only knows the name and hometown of their father: simply talking about his father doesn’t make Kris uncomfortable, it’s that he really doesn’t have an answer. He wants to give the interviewer a proper answer that answers to the questions who, where, when and why. But he doesn’t know all the answers. Why? Because he doesn’t know his father. Talking about him doesn’t make Kris sad or angry. It doesn’t cause any emotions. And the interviewer only asking so many questions because the topic is interesting due the fact that in most cases, even if someone’s parents break up, they still keep seeing both of them, for example at holidays or being a week with one parent and another week with another parent. And don’t lie and say that you haven’t ever been even the tiniest bit interested into Kris’ family dynamics.
moon gloss	Somebody please fire this interviewer
Tenzin Jurmey Dasel	I don't like how Kris is Smiling it off!!!!!!  Its so intrusive and I feel so uncomfortable that Kris is comfortable
mi chiamo thiago	I subed to this channel cause I like hip-hop but this interviewer is worse than garbage, I may unsub
Sawyer Averys	he has a bit of a mixed English accent, it's like a mixure of an Aussie accent with a hint of a Chinese accent, but for the most part sounds American
thaBAMs fix	As a women of color, I never ever would have thought Kris was into HIPHOP and basket ball.  Like if I saw him in high school, I would just thought 'he would never like me because he probably think i'm to ghetto because i'm black.' BUT BOY, IF I HAD KNOWN HE WAS bout it, bout it. I would have been like 'heeeeeeyyy mr.wu.'
BTS owns my heart	1:00 min this Moment broke my heart
Alison Lim	Worst interview ever.
snoopiboi	i liked how he kept cheesin when the interviewer keept asking about his dad. bro if the interviewer did that to me, i would have thrown the chair at him
BTS & EXO are both kings	Kris is so chill HOW I would’ve flipped that interviewer is terrible
fangurl asdfghjkl	GALAXY HYUUUUUNG
pitutupi	This interviewer was so insensitive about kris dad. I also never met my dad and i got these questions so often in my life. It‘s like people don‘t get that it‘s a sensitive topic and that growing up without a dad can cause you to go through so much shit in your life and they just keep asking personal questions in a very insensitive way like whyyyy
Gabriela Macedo	Wtf is wrong with this interviewer?? Kris was so uncomfortable, this is not the kind of questions you keep insisting on ugh
cher G	1:41 yEa...
shane	Why does it make me actually angry they keep trying to pry into his life about his dad? He said he had no contact, leave it at that. The dude kept asking the same shit.
HarperPolo	I'm more interested in his time with Exo and his career afterwards then about his damn father. 🙄
Naa Zuhry	WTH interviewer kept asking about his dad when his clearly said HE DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO HIS DAD
aza s	Some russian guy makes kris uncomfortable for 9:50 minutes straight

winwin's lines	tbh interviewer was rly pushy,, kris seemed uncomfortable and he was v awkward. the interviewer was asking WAY too many personal questions
Elena Song	I am amazed at how easy-going Kris is. He's so big in China, and very popular in North America as well. He handled the interviewer's disrespectful questions and comments while smiling. I wouldn't be able to do that honestly.
CHANNEL ViE 先锋时尚	Guys, you heard clearly this interviewer is Rrrrussian?  No wonder! I pay my respect to Kris at this point.
Savannah's STARS	the questiond weren't that disrespectful. Y'all are overreating and pretending to be "woke"
Morayo Adedapo	so you can tell he doesnt really wanna talk about his exo experience. i know the chinese members don't have good memories with SM, but i still hope the memories they shared with the members are keeping them friends
golden closet	Aww he’s so awkward
Karina Sturm	For their „boy band“.
Bunny Friends	This is very awkward interview in the beginning asking about his dad
lau kwokchun	This interviewer sucks at interviewing. What the fuck is he doing?

Brooklyn	......does the interviewer think all asian are small and short?? stereotypical smh
krystalx	wts why are they asking such sensitive questions about his dad? this is not a counselling session lol? but Kris handled the questions very professionally! proud of u, galaxy!
Miss Capricorn	Kris DOESN'T want to talk about his dad... then why da fuq are you asking????  Are you THAT dumb to figure out that he's uncomfortable???😑 You should burn In hell for forcing someone to talk about that they don't actually want to.🙂
Violette Picker	ok the interview was shit bUT KRIS’S ENGLISH THO WOWWWW
Tahsin Mahmud Adib	I think he asked sensitive questions and he's talking like every us kid is 6ft tall 🐸🐸
Tiffany Keepers	Kris handled the EXO questions so well. But he is so much better solo because he stands out as an individual. I love EXO but I wish I could see more solo from EXO
Alejandro Gonzalez	You went back to China because SM can't touch there. Fucking traitor.

T F	ohhh this is the really shitty interviewer who gave that shitty and insulting interview for jay park also. damn sorry kris wu had to go through this also.
pentagon hui's wifeu	The interviewer should feel honour to get to interview kris wu and not someone else. But he was acting really rude like wtf? Not gonna mention about what he said but y'all know it. Luckily kris is very kind. Ugh
u aa	His voice shivered a bit shocked me😓

Siti Hajar	Dude have u done this before? That was soooo awkward. Kris was struggling to answer those questions
mochihyunilee serious	ok kris was so uncomfortable with those questions like dude LEAVE HIM ALONE. he obviously expects people to question about HIS music and stuffs. SO STICK TO HIM ONLY PLEASE.
blub	wow i felt so uncomfy listening to his questions
M R S. J E O N	WE MISS YOU YIFAAAAN! EXO NEEDS YOU! THEY DONT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH! HAHAHAHAHA KIDDING.
H e w w o	Besides the whole thing about privacy, how about actually doing some proper research as well? Is it that hard to get 12 members down?
Ridashisha Kharsati	This interview is kinda akward but kris did a good job 🤗🤗
Nicole Delight	To the interviewer, You know our galaxy,kris wu,is you know he is not you know comfortable and you know he doesnt want your questions and you know cant you feel it uhm uhm you know we love him you know pls be good to him you know.I fuckin' loath you?you know?

Cheryl Ho	shit interviewer
Navera Arif	dumb bitches really think all asian kids are short lmao
Echo Koo	I have observed Kris love to say yeah😂
Putri Wulandari	People may thumbs down this video not because they hate kris, but they hate THIS INTERVIEW. it's so offensive to talk about "a father" who left a family and don't give a fuck about that family. I think it bitter for kris to talk about him but you ask too many questions about it :( not good :(
Nemo 2003	Thank you Kris because you don't forget exo and us I'm really go on crying I can't stop I know that exo missed you so much you and luhan and Tao we really loves all of you and we really wished for exo return having a twelve wolf again and the last thing I will always support you
Hıll _	I thought the Jay park interview was bad 😫 this was garbage
MarkJin ParkTuan	I miss him my galaxy fanfan so muuuch 😭  but the interviewer is kinda disrespectful !
nurul zahidah	this is so uncomfortable to watch it feels like i'm invading a too personal part of kris,,,, kudos for kris for being calm ❤
Diane Marchadesch	Whut the heck I thought Kris was Mino (winner) on the thumbnail 😂
Well we know bts, exo and twice are legends Zainy	Did that interviewer really need to ask almost all questions about his dad?? I mean if he is really interested in his dad then he should interview of his dad not him 😑. He should be thankful  that Kris didn't freak out on his any lame questions. 😳
btsfanarmy	Okey i wanna kill that person in the background what kind questions is that bro!!
chococatchristi	I’m so proud but I’m still crying. OT12 is still in my heart no matter. I’m proud of all the members, both current and past. My chogiwa kings 👑❤️👑❤️👑❤️👑❤️
Rafa Jingona	Kris just don't want to meet his dad or talk about it stop asking 😑
Poop cheese	Im sad that Kris wu not being there EXO back nothing group other😢
ElleTee	Don't like the interviewer but kris handled it very well
Vicky Lieu	I believe the questions about his father is too personal. How rude to ask those questions I would have left but he is so kind to do so. This interview I hate it, he stereotype him just because he is tall and Asian. Just because you are an immigrant yourself does not give you a right to stereotype others. Do not stereotype others, because you would not want someone stereotype you!
galaxyyaoyao ff	I love you.
kpop l.o.v.e	This interview could've been much better ya'know :(
Yukiko93_YP	THIS INTERVIEW WAS  UNCOMFORTABLE BC THAT MAN ONLY  ASKED HIM ABOUT  HIS PERSONAL LIFE  INSTEAD OF HIS CARRER AND MUSIC  LIKE WTF!!?????
污婆婆	Is he doing a black accent
Ann Moe	y asking abt his dad bro?
Yemile Ramos	Wtf with the questions about his father? As the daughter of a mom who got divorced when I was little and after that my family completely separated from my dad this made me really mad. He doesn't have a relationship with his Dad after they got divorced, end of the topic don't go ask more questions. Sometimes I even don't remember that I had a Dad and it isn't even sad, you get used to it, just don't bring the Dad topic to us.
YourKpop FanGirl	I'm counting "yeah" who's with me?
Anonymous Girl	Honestly the guy asking question was really rude and insincere
Trash Kpop Fan	He looks fucking uncomfortable when that guy asks questions about his dad
jake lee	First of all, he is not Chinese at all,He is Canadian. Secondly, he is a Faker rapper in China(His freestlye is like shit. ).and finally, many ignorant girls pursue him. Reasonable Chinese people hate him. He is too fond of talking big. I am a pure Chinese. I just want to talk about my true opinion.
aesthetae	he's so fucking HANDSOME dude
An Shieh	Wtf this made me so uncomfortable. This was tactless as hell
kiana m	the interview is a whole scum for keep continuously asking about his father like leave his ass alone. but kris not trying to whoop his ass either
Sylvie Rouhier	Honestly the only reason I watched your videos was because Kris Wu and Jay Park, your interview style of invading peoples personly business and past is too much! It's hard to watch, I'd love to dislike this video but I love Kris Wu too much! (◣_◢) You need to learn to respect people before you can properly interview them! @_@
Souji Her	Kris is 6’2
TaEhYuNg SnAtChEd My WiG	god christ, he seems so uncomfortable, my poor child
J A N I N E T E U T L E	The interviewer is so disrespectful wtf
K E	This interviewer is kinda rude. Kris made it pretty clear the dad thing was not an issue he cared about or wanted to talk about...  But Kris is super classy so it worked out I guess. 💁
eyena	Kris ma boi *excited af *  Edit: stop making him speak about his father...jump this shit
Oumnia Reghai	I couldn't finish the interview I legit stopped in 1:50 because of the amount of disrespect. Like bro move on he answered abt his dad what do u want more? For him to cry? Stay strong galaxy wu yi fan 😻❤

Gashlycrumb Tiny	lmao what is this interview??? asking about his dad like 20 fucking times? take a hint vlad the fuck
Seni Josh	Kris is so cute. Uwu. I liked this interview, it made me understand better why he left exo. I just didn't like the guy asking him all those questions about his father, like wtf?! He just kept asking and asking, and when kris thought that it was over, the guy asked again about his father....jesus christ, some things are just personal, please respect that. Kris baby, I love u and support u no matter what💗💗💗💞💕
like dream	I hope you will stop talking about his father in the future
jikook letter	I don't understand why you are asking about his dad for 3 minutes like I just don't get. I think that is so personal and hard for him. But he's keep smiling and that is so sweet. Well done Kris!
i english very well more than you	omg i think thats too much questionsss
Lawliet Frost	the most awkward interview ever
_alexation _	Omg he looks like the guy from EXO
calico **	this interviewer was kinda disrespectful💀ghh
C. Ling	I feel him on the dad part
nana craves for the better world	why does he talk like that?
Crystalmarie Robles	the whole father thing is not okay. once he said his father wasn't in the picture you should have stopped it there pushing the issue isn't okay because the whole father subject can be a triggering thing and also no offense that's something insanely personal and that's none of your or our business
Mishal Asif	I don't like how this interviewer handled this.
susan jackson	Why are you asking him 50 questions about his dad?  You jerk
Samantha	I love Kris but not this interview nuh uh
Grecia Ventura	Ugh this interview was really bad, can the interviewer have any less enthusiam. The amount of times you say ok is ridiculous and it sounds so dismissive. Also if he says he hasnt ever met his father then thats it like wtf else do u have to ask.
Nikki	im actually cringing from the guy asking about his dad continuously.
Sarah Azzawi	Isn't the guy's questions too private?  Bruh xD  Good job Kris! He did great! :)
Ikram Bb	Why dafuQ is the interviewer so curious about kris's father!!!
Lilli-Mae Rudland	Why’d he bring his god damn father up wth? And then continue to ask about him wtf
jackson's baby	what the actual fuck is this interviewer doing
Alternative Human	Who tf let this dude become an interviewer??
vorpheuss	Guys relax , although the interviewer asks a lot of questions about Kris’s father, but I think he was given the mission to find out what happened . Like I don’t think his tone is that disrespectful and honestly kris seems aight with it so I think it’s best to not blow something up 🙁
Sara Rendon	What’s with these rude ass questions??? Wtf
Anna In The Work	YEAH
Danielle	Damn. I’ve never seen anyone give an interview like this. Who does that?   He doesn’t know about his dad. Why would you keep asking? Tf?!?  They need to get rid of this interviewer.
eggcelent	yo who is this interviewer bc he clearly is not fit for the job
Cherrybomb	“Alright so what happened to your dad?”  “Ok...... ok”  Daaa fuq?? This is hella disrespectful
kmt	this made me feel awkward as fuck why keep asking about his dad? yifan obviously felt uncomfortable, you can tell by his face
Vivian mj	“ be a doctor or a lawyer” relatable
Mirae Moon	Wow the interviewer sucks
Illusionen	Well..This was so awkward to watch
Camila Medeiros	i honestly can't believe they asked about his father..... why not ask about his mum
Eunice Chew	Interviewers, please give Kris some privacy to be kind and respects him, don't ever ask question about his father again🙏
m3811md17216b	クリスがEXO時代について話したって聞いて来たけど、内容は悪くないけど話す時の表情はやっぱり硬い…お父さんのことについてといい、全体的に話しづらいというか、聞いてほしくないような質問ばっかりしてくるインタビュアー…なんか残念😥
Amisha ajith	Wtffff dude so many fokin personal questionsjust shut your damn shit
Frozan Kouhdamani	what the hell? this interviewer needs to know his limits, he can't be going so deep into his personal life. It has nothing to do with him You can tell how uncomfortable it is for Kris I get that you're doing your job but you aren't some sort of detective to dig deep into his personal life love Kris Wu though xx
Loading Nickname	The way MC asked about Kris’ dad was impolite.
Rósa Isaksen	This is so awkward, and I feel second-hand uncomfortableness (I don't think that's a word but Idc) for Yifan.
Amii	the interviewer was disrespectful dafuq
Shimu Miaw	F**k know your boundaries. Stop asking him such personal questions. He was feeling so uncomfortable
Lisa Buhphang	❤❤❤❤
Leigh Blanca	What an insensitive interviewer.
rifvocado	vlad, you needa go suck a dick. like seriously, pushing kris to talk about private issues like his family divorcing and asking about his dad??? thats literally none of your business.
Stephanie Pompey	This interview is full on awkward and stop asking him about his dad
cm	...the interview is just disrespectful . JUST LOOK AT MY BOY ! He is uncomfortable
xiumin xiumin kokobop	Who tf keeps pressuring him with dad questions?!?
TIFFANY LYE SU JIN 3T	hey interviewer, stay out of other people's personal business. it's none of your business and it's clearly a topic that he doesn't want to talk about. if kris doesn't want to talk about it then don't ask about it.
Liz S	...the f...
Priyangi Magotra	kris wu baby u deserve better than this youre a fucking superstar and we love you
Sahra Leeting	i thought his dad was kind of a taboo topic. like everyone just agreed to not talk about it.... at least back in the days you know
genodiva 2201	Remember that moment when EXO members imitate him, crying bout his Mom like "Moommm😢" yeah well now I know why
LPS lyra	ayo waddup kris  ayo wassuuuuup  memories ;_;
yoonmen yup	When your an ot12 stan and desperately want to move on but Kris wrecks your resolutions on letting go. Even when you are no longer a part of EXO, I would still support and stream your music, in my heart you're still in EXO.  We are one, EXO!
Farheen Akram	I hate the interviewer WTF DOES HE HAVE TO DO WITH HIS DAD IF HE NEVER KNEW HIM LIKE WHY DOES HE HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM 😤
Ezee Flores	The interviewer is awful for pushing those Dad questions...no, sorry, shoving them.
Desirae Vaccaro	Kris was always my bias in EXO and I still stan him, wherever he goes. He is actually a great actor! The interview though... I also grew up without a father and you don't know what its like unless you went through it. Cheers, Kris. Your fans still support you!
nini 06	I'm emo over the Dad Qs, it's kind of painful tbh. but I'm so proud of Kris on how he openly shared his answers. I wanna cry out of proudness because I can only imagine his younger days going through life without His Dad,must have been difficult but he pulled through. he did so well. He didn't get lost. He's always been an inspiring human being to me.  I love his proud smile when He answered he speaks fluent Korean hehe. Some good memories in there.  I've always love how Kris answers qs about EXO. Some things will remain private, a mystery to fans, but the fact is HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SO GRATEFUL. That's one important thing. Tbh, whenever i recall those bad days as a meigeni, i wanna throw back the hate antis splashed on Kris,lol. But yeah we grow up, and whenever I see Kris happy and grateful, who am I to attack/hate back. he's always been so nice and mum about the real harsh things he have received from some people. He never spoke bad against them. Such a kind hearted artist.  I'm out of here before my sleepyhead and emo heart gets out of control lol.  Just wanna greet this beautiful person a Happy birthday!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY KRIS!  CAN'T WAIT FOR 12MN HEHE Congratulations on your new songs!!!🔥
Deshie X	OMG WHY TF HE ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS DAD..you asked the first one found out they were divorced WHY TF YOU KEEP ASKING..?!?!?!?!?!?!?! annoying af... interviewer: TRASH
LEM0NCT	ngl this interviewer needs to chill wtf even if he doesn't mind answering isa stretch fucking interrogating him about his dad smh nonyadamnbusiness
Mishal Awais	the interviewer is so disrespectful.
#KSHIPZKLING #KSHIPZKLING	THIS GUY ASKING SO MANY STUPID QUESTIONS! INSTEAD OF INVESTIGATING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE, INVEST IN YOUR OWN, STUPID MAN!
Nadia Salma	Crying inside :"
hioji_ kakao	To kris dad, your lost. Every other dad would want to have a kid as successful as kris 😡 Now kris is the one who hv to answer all the annoying things that the interviewer ask about his dad whose he never meet or know! 😡
Fatihah's Channel	SPILL THE TEA
KOMIKO X MILKY WAY	Even kris wu download music into his mp3.....means doesn't matter for us right??
silentmockingjay	damn I just love hear him talk...
Constantine_Azrael_Gustav love	Yeah yeah............. Oh yeah yeah....... Ahmmm yeah yeah!!!! Oh yeah like... Like yeah yeah!!!😂😂

lusha rehan	Fighting  kris ✊✊✊ we love you ...
Takao Tanaka	i like this interview
3leggedgoddess _032	This is raw! I love it! No filter! Kris is very impressive handling and answering all that questions like wow! Respect!
Clover.TaeTae’s Paireno	The interviewer’s questions about kris’s dad is making me uncomfortable
Tam OConnell	Wooooow! Most uncomfortable interview, jeez!  Shout out to Kris Wu for staying focused. Surprised he finished this interview, and didn't tell Vlad to FO!
Charmie	❤️❤️
surrila YG	Why ask so much questions about a serious topic... Why? Manners dude
Prakriti Gunjiyal	HE TRULY DESERVES EVERYTHING 😭
Ratna Sari TyaDewi	Most of the time he said. YEAH YEAH YEAH! 😅😅
Qianye He	He is cool
Hazel Aboga-a	Vlad, what exactly are you doing? 😒
NIMISHA	the interviewer is such a douchhhhhhhh
xli.lxo	is this the same channel that asked jay park hella questions about his past with 2pm and made him hella uncomfortable bc he kept prying and wouldn’t drop the topic?? now he’s making kris uncomfortable with questions about his father? bro what is wrong with you 💀💀💀💀
Shrix J	Damn its sad how he kept smiling n answering such private questions.. he has come to promote  album.. not tell his sad story.. the interviewer should know what to ask n what not
vixen r?.	Why ask some personal ass questions?
Iris Wang	When I knew him at 2012, I never thought he could be such a great artist, looking fowrd to his antares!
Brooke M	wtf is this interview
마리아FutureboundEXE	Damn this boy lived 40m away from me.  Also y’all shitting on the interviewer, stop! He’s doing his job, if you find out that Kris Wu has never really HAD his father around and seemingly hasn’t talked about it publicly, you’re gonna want NEW info, headlines, etc.  He definitely pushed the dad thing, but he isn’t horrible for doing it. He’s doing his job as well as being curious  (Also Canada Pride fuckers!!! We’re winning)
ChimmyChimmy Kokobop	Some of these questions are way to personal
dmoreno200	Our forever Galaxy  ..
milk and cereals	the interviewer smh
박세인	WTF whos the man asking questions .....you really didnt know how to ak questions and what to ask .....😤😤😬😬😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡
Charlie L	so cute
winwin thepooh	urmmm... ACTUALLY there are plenty of Asians who are tall what do you mean he's tall for an asian kid??????
baek.urmylight	This was so uncomfortable to watch...I can't imagine how Kris actually felt doing this. The interviewer sounds like a prosecutor lawyer who is like questioning him about some crime. Those questions about his father were really unnecessary. Anybody with eyes and ears could tell how uncomfortable kris was. I am glad kris talked about Exo. And told why he really left. It's okay kris. People who hate you for this probably don't know that it's okay to move away from one company professionally. It happens everywhere..in every field... i still miss ot12 and i hope that even if you can't go back to be with exo...you all become friends again. No matter if we know it or not. Stay happy❤
Eliza Soberanes	Pinchi Kris te amo :,,v
Evelyn Medina	Pinche entrevistador mamón, a ti te viene valiendo verga el puto señor que se le hace llamar padre, hasta en su carita se le veía lo incómodo/triste que estaba.
Kaden Nguyen	imagine how popular in america exo would be with an english speaker like kris
Anna Vuu	so do these questions go through any type of screening or is it trash on purpose
Touka Kirishima	He looks likes he was about to cry
Polly Terán	Porque le pregunta tanto sobre su padre wtf???
Fadumo Mohamed	The reporter really got balls to ask Kris those questions. I dare him to ask Nicki Minaj similar questions and watch her slap his dumb ass out of business🙂
deelovesyou	Wtf is this a therapy session? Ask kris sum real questions!! Lol
Azumi Cabarloc	“A total of 12” - kris uWi I’m cryinggggg
sydeesoo	So uncomfortable to watch him smile while talking about the absence of his father.....I got second-hand embarrassment for the interviewer
therealiamkentot	He just said that HE DIDN’T KNOW HIS FATHER since his parents separated like when he was just a baby but the interviewer still ask MORE QUESTIONS and I was like..WTF BRO??  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
stan red velvet	He looked pretty uncomfortable with the questions regarding his father, its a pretty sensitive topic. He took it like a professional, he just smiled through it.
candyprincess8353	why the FUCK is he asking so many questions about his dad
Lee Jinhue	istg the interviewer needs to get his brain checked istg
alice	what an awkward interview
Holly D	How uncomfortable is this..

jiminIsbeautyjiminIsgraceIwantjiminsnutonmyface	he weird af
At Night	Back at it with them personal and disrespectful questions, huh? Looks like Jay Park wasn't  enough for you. I'm surprised these idols even agree to interviews with you. They're either too nice to say no or they simply don't know what's in store for them lmao
Kiah Lavarias	Now wtf why you keep on asking him with personal things? Like.. Border dude, hope you knew it. -.-
Julie Beachx	I miss Kris being with EXO sm
Just Trash	BRUH THE FUCKING INTERVIEWER IS FUCKING SHIT FKSHSKSHSJ
Jenna Gao	lmao interviewer seemed to know nothing about who he was interviewing on top of that, questions were unnecessarily intrusive? wack interview, shoutout to kris for sitting through it

alice beatrice	When he was talkin about Exo I got emotional ❤
Hiroto Alexandria	Im deaaaddd this interview is so awkward but it's so nice to hear from Kris
Jo Jo	Playing basketball. Acting. Being part of a Korean boy group. Making your own music instead. Trying out a lot. I think you're doing it right. Maybe it's already your music, but finally there will be something that feels goddamn right and makes you happy with all decisions you made. Until then I hope you'll be happy anyway.
Uyen Nguyen	This bitchass interviewer omfg
Ahgase Still here	i will be always with you ❤️❤️ love you so much my galaxy 🌌

Ank6612	This interview made me uncomfortable. He don’t wanna talk about his dad. He don’t even know his dad well enough to even talk about him.
Los tres Mosqueteros	Camila Cabello 2.0 “You know”
Yosy Ortiz	This interviewer is plain stupid.
less avi	💕
holly	why yall ask so much questions about his dad bruh. he looks so mf uncomfortable.
뫄	I know he really misses his homies. i know he misses Suho (srry, im KrisHo shipper). I really want see all members again together, only once.
Niso Girl	Can you make a Interview with Tao and Luhan pleaseee. I mean Not totally the same, but questions about EXO. I wish they were 12
Brittany Huggins	I’m so proud of Kris for handling the interview as well as he did. I don’t think I would have been able to keep smiling like he was here, but Kris is sweet and so so so talented. He didn’t deserve the disrespect of being pestered with these intrusive questions about his dad and such and then being slighted with small comments about his height and being Asian, like so?
bby kierra	Wtf is this ..
syiera	He suppose to not even ask him that. Its worst
Mayra L	The person interviewing him was awful
Monbebe	Wtf this is so annoying why does the interviewer keep asking about his dad when kris just said he never seen or spoke to him. I could tell kris was uncomfortable. Ughh
Kalolaine Ika	Kris started getting uncomfortable on this interview and it hurt my heart😭
Gene I3	Same thing with my ma kind of never knew my dad
nouchi lor	I don’t want to blame that interviewer but those questions were soo damn cringe worthy & obviously awkward as hell. Poor Chris.
No exo No life	Omfg he is smiling but I can clearly see that he didn’t want to answer those questions ..I feel his pain 😭😢 I wanna cry , BUT SERIOUSLY WHY ARE YOU PUSHING HIM SO HARD 🤯OMG HE SO UNCOMFORTABLE JEES ....😤
pompom2001	I'm sure Kris' management team okayed this as it's a good way to garner support lol
are you nana?	No era necesario esas preguntas y más si es sobre exo
SBreeze 115	Why the interviewer act like kris is the only person to ever not have a dad in their life
reyanne langrich	This interview is bullshit. Dude you don't know how to do an interview!
ZHER0	Start from 2:37 did he laugh?

kナフナ	*This interview just making me mad.. Wtf are those questions??*
Scarlet Ash	This interview is so awkward! It is not an even conversation and the interviewer just keeps repeating everything he says over and over.
Galeano알레	I love this man
the ikonic astronaut is not on fire	Damn that interviewer
SlothMode Reacts	I felt like the digging into his relationship with his father was excessive, invasive, and unnecessary. After a certain point it became too much, the interviewer needs to be able to read the person they are interviewing.
العُـنقود	Ok ok okay
Shiro Moo	Can I know who's the interviewer? Can I slap him? he shouldn't ask him about his private life. I feel so uncomfortable
Daddykink with sehun	um i felt very uncomfortable watching this interview,,, wow,,,, i wonder how kris felt

Kassidy Rose	this interview made me uncomfortable
Ashwin Kumar Kispotta	The interviewer should have asked about his artistry....
AyyyYER23	Kris Wu!!! ❤
MiinMiin Chiang	wtf is wrong with the interviewer? so disrespectful in many ways= =
ZZ Smile	Are you feeling as uncomfortable as I am? Kris you handled this ultra-awkward interview well.
kylamvickers	Ugh this interview is just as bad as the one he did with Jay Park, stereotypes and just plain disrespect
k - jesus	“fOr aN aSiAn tHaTs rEaLLy tALL” dude, not all asians are short.
Kiara	Hey man don't be arrogant that Europeans are taller even most tallest men are born in Asia and you have to know that Kris is very famous in Asia and Europe so it's doesn't matter about his personal life he is very talented man and he have guts to face irrelevant questions
Linxi Peng	Wow, luv my wu
emily aponte	So kris wu is going to join exo again like for real or no CAN someone tell me
BabyJ	WOW...HE JUST BASICALLY HARRASSED KRIS....why would you invade someones privacy like that...I bet they wouldnt like it
Shruyoti Manandhar	Really disrespestful interviewer how many times will u question my kris about his father 😤😤😑😑😐 fuck off
Huzaifa Mushtaq	Goddammit stop!! I wanna slap whoever wrote those questions! It's such a sensitive topic, you don't casually talk about stuff like this and look at Kris, his smile looks really fake and he looks so sad.
Flora Q	The interviewer made me cringe so much..... 😂
Fatma Dewy	i hope you back to EXO ....Kriss oppa😢😢
Kim 99	Ignore everything & just focus on his deep & manly voice...GGGGODDD
sami islam	the interviewer had no right to put him in the spotlight and ask such and soo many personal questions like that he's actually dumb or what
Sian	Why does this interviewer always ask such shit questions. He did the same thing to Jay Park. Like wtf is it his style to be a douche or something?!
D H U H A	Uhh! this interviewer is so fckin rude!!! plz dude can u be more kindly when u asking about his dad???
vashti Assumi	Dumb qs
LamLam Joyce	Hey dude please respect to Kris WU’s privacy... it is fkn rude
oohstepp	Guys, take a shot everytime Kris say "yeah" lol    I hated this interview. First half was so bad. Damn interviewer.
miss nady	Oh damn I dont know his parents divorced. He must been through a lot of pain growing up without a father
Honey Treats	1. You don’t question someone’s absent father and KEEP asking it. You practically forced him into a corner to answer his questions. 2. Your comments about asians weren’t horrible, but I just want social media platforms to be used well and not encourage stereotypes.
Ican'tHandleHobisBoogieBootyAnymoreSendHelp	*The interviewer didn't even freakin know he rapped in EXO???* Plus *digging so deep in his personal life* with the questions about his dad... wow, what the actual *fuck??!!!*  I'm so proud of Kris for being so kind, keep smiling and answering these idiots question and not just walking off... which we all would've understood & supported.
Steph GD	Pretty insensitive line of questions, really uncomfortable. Kris is a sweetheart 💜
Keizhel VLogs	He chuckled 6:03
ayumi96love	7:40 yeah i interview Jay Park, lmao no wonder you sound so familiar, youre the idiot with dumb questions, still wondering why sexy jay will even accept his interview
Chelsea Bless	Poor Kris, I feel his pain, he's such a sweet and kind person. STUPID INTERVIEWER!!!!
Annette Edwards	GOSH DAMN IT!!!!  THIS GUY WHO IS INTERVIEWING KRIS PISSED ME OFF!!!!  He's SO DAMN DISRESPECTFUL PERSON!!!!
skatergirl 123	I’m so uncomfortable, can he stop asking him bout his dad ffs😩
FIIX ONEZ	🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤kriswuulifan
Cory Holmes	The point of an interview is to ask those uncomfortable questions.  He wants to break in american mark especially hip hop.  He better get use to it.    This isnt asia where they have all questions before interview and its all basically acted out.   He did a good job.  Everyone need stop crying. Vlad did his job like he always does.
Caticorn K	That’s the saddest interview of Kris Wu he looks so uncomfortable while answering the questions and I think these questions were a little bit to much 😔
Won Niyya	Kris look's very uncomfort:(
LIFE vs LIFE	the dam f***ing questions about the family is very private. you could see it in kris's face
Lover엑 소_	Interviewer : So you are pretty fluent in korea...wow   Kris : yea..hehe  Cute😂😂😂
Bacon	Someone get this interview fired. so many of those "questions" were unnecessary and the interviewer could've just done some research to get the answers. Pretty much none of these questions provided any insight on a Kris' personality
Vivi Jane Charles	Wow!!  The interviewer tryanna squeeze all of Kris' intestines out to know about his personal life. But Kris being so sweet and professional, dealt with this shit moment so well.
vicky lee	'Yeah' counted : million times
YONG	hey djvlad. this video only gets that many likes because we wholeheartedly support kris as an artist. so i hope you're not sitting there thinking you got lots of likes because you're a great interviewer, because that's entirely not the case, at all. while kris was being super nice and welcoming, you were being extremely unprofessional and disrespectful. i've seen a lot of shows where the interviewers ask hard-hitting questions; this isn't how you do it. i hope kris has a wonderful day.
ffelicia 0h	влад, thank you
Kris Wu	Kris Wu is very strong and gentle to others. His first album 'Antares' will be released on November 02. Please pay attention to it.
EXO XIUMIN	U DITCHED EXO FOR THAT !
Christine Khamo	Kris. 😭😭😭
tipi topi	Traitor
emma j.	What's up with this interviewer?! Why is he asking intrusive questions? More than his personal life, he should ask about his professional one...
리아나	Okay but the way he smiles whenever he says "Yeah" makes me so happy like AWWWWW BABY 😍😍😍
I live for Suho booty	Omg this is just so annoying. I don't know about you but I feel super uncomfortable listening to Kris talking about his dad, plus am asking the interviewer before asking any celebrity please research some of their information.But any way Love you Kris . Keep up the work. Sorry my English is really bad
Drm Frost	STOP ASKING ABOUT HIS FATHER GOSH
filthy mudblood	WHAT A TERRRIBLE TERRIBLE INTERVIEWER!! Why the hell would you keep on pushing those questions about his dad, that was really unprofessional and uncomfortable to watch. Know where to draw a line :(((((((((((((((((((((((((
Samantha Jacobo	Wait what happened about kris wu with exo??
jess mai	wtf is wrong with the interviewer? stereotyping asians, digging into kris' past issues and asking so much of his dad, this guy is so fucking rude istg
Amber Rodriguez	PART 2!!!!
Ice Aroonpong	Whay is WRONG with the interview?????? Why do you keep asking aboit his dad?? Damn, give a man space. Glad he handled it well. I wouldve blown my top.
sinneruki	What kind of content is this interview trying to give   Tasteless
Jmaica Smith	"YEAH" 😂LOL
Sophia Yamaguchi	I'm cringing from him here more than when he was an exo member holy fuck "eyyy thanks for having me brother" I bet people cringe the same way I'm cringing when i say dude and bro LOL
TaeKook Is My Religion	Fuck this interviewer and his shitty channel
ShinyBusterBaby	Love you, Kris!!! Still with you, baby boy!!!💗💗💗💗💗
Michaela Marie Jacoba	I miss the EXO's Galaxy,Kris Wu
KevjumbaNigahigaYTF ARMYVIPEXOL	WORST INTERVIEWER!! I'm stressed just listening how he is asking questions and reacting to Kris' answers!! Love how Kris is so respectful and polite despite the rudeness and ignorance​.
boi wot	Y'all are fucking nosy fuck u and choke on my dick
wassgud 12	I love you Kris❤️ but wtf is up with the interviewer
annie.thinggoes	Aw, Kris is so genuine and cute. He's so honest and independent.
Kendell Salem	I first saw Kris Wu in one of his movies. And then, I did some searching checked out his music, and interviews. He's such a talented guy. I would definitely give him a thumbs up lol.
Vi er 77	The interviewer is insensitive, i can feel that kris is uncomfortable about "dad" topic
알리야 로즈Alliah Rose	He just want to pursue his own thing about music and he can't do it if he's in the team. He just love his music but he also love his team. I cry when he left but I understand him now more. I know he love his team but he just want to grow... I hope for his happiness always. Keep shining my ultimate bias, forever and always.
Anju Potsangbam	After seeing this,I began to love him more.
Makenzye Blackwater	I'm sad about his past and the questions that were asked, but I am proud of Kris handling this interview very well!  But people who read this, just know that VladTV is a personal interviewer who asks deep questions. I am sad to hear about Kris' father, but Kris handled it well! He also said a lot about EXO; thank you Kris!  I love you Kris and I'll support you no matter what!! Good luck on your album!! #Antares ♡♡♡
Somila Thokchom	I miss when he was in exo
puta fea y zorra	I love kris n I would’ve throw hands if I had been in his position with that rude ass interviewer
sdghv lvhgngv	i live in vancouver and have some how never heard of him. he comes off like the typical rich chinese kid in this city lol. just googled him and he even went to a high school i'm familiar with. crazy.
Cloud Nyne	He's nervous when EXO topic came in. : (
Daddy Longlegs	Chris was so uncomfortable dnskjsksnsks I would be to tho fhdkksks
Yutbunny Chan	I dont like the interviewer -__-   He asked too many private question about his family .
Haritha Ashok	Wtf is wrong with the interviewer? How can you ask like that about his dad, I mean he could just ask once and stop. Idiot!
cute cutie	Kris Wu was ma fav. Member in EXO n still he ma fav.  And its okay to not have a daddy and proud of how strong you grew up, you be ma mentor from today coz i hv no dad too so is a mom, be happy with ya mom n love you 4eva
Nmatczak	All the questions about his dad made me upset ;-; let the poor boy live
Zahra Tanisha Khan	His smile is absolutely gorgeous 💕 But the interviewer made me so uncomfortable with those questions but Kris handled them so well
No Way	Honestly you should apologize for asking too many questions about his father At the time when he was in EXO, Kris really was upset when fans asked him about his family, and requested them to not ask those kind of questions  So tell me, why fans, which have even a young age group, could understand the request, but you, a grown man, can't?   Сказал же один раз, что нет отца и он никогда его не видел, зачем ещё больше допрашивать насчёт этого?
Donald Trump	Lol bet his dad regret leaving him 💵 ⭐️
h hxlv	You're doing a good job kris, I'm proud of you.  You've worked hard...  pls be healthy & rest well, I love you 💕
jenø the søftie	Bit harsh with the questions, going a bit too in depth about his father. Who knows maybe Kris didn’t wanna talk about this.... he seemed a little uncomfortable 😑
Carmen Garcia	I love him so much. I’m so glad he’s doing so well with his music career, especially since he had to endure a lot of hardships and discrimination in SM. I teared up a little when he talked about ot12. He was one of my faves since day 1 and I’m glad I can still support his musical career outside of EXO
trash	yo this is the worst interviewer he obviously didn’t want to talk about his dad and the stereotyping about his height and being asian is so disrespectful
df julesful	Do you have siblings? He's Chinese born in China of course not!
WingedBunny	Dude this is how he talks in English? I was not expecting that 😂
Shine Gallarde	What happen to his voice??
Leann Pham	fuck those dad- questions. what the fuck?
Iris Lu	OMG This interviewer DOES NOT RESPECT Kris at all. Stop asking his father okay?
agie	bro what is this a public therapy session LEAVE THE MAN AND HIS FAMILY BUSINESS ALONE
natalie hi	All the dad questions were really unnecessary, but krissisissisis i relate on all levels mine flaked on me too lol but it really is how it is
Anna Li	im sorry that sm wasnt more lenient towards krishantao. like it was different six years ago i understand that. but they really could've made an effort to let them work on the music they wanted and be a part of the group. obviously not making them work too hard and trying to also give a little free time here and there.
Twins Vlog	My baby❤️❤️❤️
amber loves to cry for her idols, bye	Bitch stop asking about his dad DUH
Christina Leneus	Damn…you being made press about this kid personal life…Did daddy this…? Did daddy that…? Where was ever daddy…? And, daddy if ever…WHAT? DAMN MAN GET OFF BOUT IT!
vy ngo	i'm surprised kris didn't lose his shit during this interview, like the past is the past. keep it in the past ya fucking ass
Nicole Magmanlac	I tried to count how many times kris said "yeah"..yeah  I tried 😂
Farin Rahman	I have so much respect and love for Kris for being so polite with the DJ when he was being super disrespectful and asked so many personal questions
Sabihah Islam	I LOVE YOU KRIS but tbh this interviewer is kinda annoying
Jimin	Bruh why ask questions about his dad. That's his privacy
Dar K	Kris my baby I love youuuuu
kittycath auh	"Chicken is not my style" our kris wu!😍
Rina Parliya	Stop asking inappropriate questions abt his Dad, his past, his childhood & family. It was terrible for him, he deserves more respect as a guest star.
Vivi N	Oh my goodness... this interviewer really doesn't know what privacy means.. or "taktgefühl". (I am sorry, i only know the german word and i couldn't find a good english translation of it.  It is kind of the sense of knowing how to properly communicate, like being respectful and empathetic. That's the best way that i could describe it^^)  My point is: This interviewer sucks.
Julie Vo	I’m only 1 minute into this and I don’t like it already. Like he just said it’s just him and his mom and I’m reading the comments that he was asking questions abt his dad like wtf
BANGTAN's wifu	we miss you .... ☹️
Abby o	Y'all comments are mostly about the damn interviewer going on about Kris' dad and I'm living for them all lol
rose water	if I had been asked all those questions about my dad I would have slapped someone. Kris and I have similar situations it seems bUT HE'S SO CALM ABOUT IT
oppar	this interview was a flop lmao
a11 Bb	I AM NOT EVEN AN EXOL NOR DO I KNOW ANYYTHING ABOUT KRIS  BUT omfg I’M SOOO ANNOYED BY THOS INTERVIEWER
Jennifer Daniels	You asked about his dad so much I thought we were gonna have a Maury moment and you were gonna come out as his dad. WTF, man. Incredibly disrespectful. Kris certainly didn't need to waste his time with you, but kudos to him for handling your that gross amount of prying so well. First and last video of yours I'll be watching.
mericaisg8bcmericaisgud	Wow his English got so much better
Chanyeol's first And last wife	3:42 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Atsuko One	Omg he was pushing the topic about his father too much like wtf
CHENANIAH DEL ROSARIO	kriiisssss we miss youuu❤oppaaaa
Prive BBH	YEA YEAAAA HAHAHAHA
joyita	this is an awful interview. i’m sorry, kris.
Sof.	I felt awkward watching this interview. This man is asking him questions, but doesn't make this interview lively at all. He's just jumping from one question to another. On top of that, he really makes this interview even more awkward by asking him sensitive questions and keeps hammering on them. Stop doing that man. Not cool.
Selina Meier	He’s so cute😭❤️
avery	my guy! 🦂🦂🦂
Super Sonic	This guy reminds of some Chinese nerd I went to school with but was obsessed with hip hop. Maybe he is him, idk. But he sure looks like the dude.
jeon somi	we hope you were happy now kris 💕 god always bless you 💕 we always love you no matters what 🤗🤗🤗
angel ma	if someone keep on asking about my dad i will go NAH i am not gonna answer any of that. THIS IS SO RUDE
Ann Lucena	You are the worst bastard I have ever had a misfortune to encounter. I get it, it's your job, but you really didn't have any reason to be a dick about it. You don't seem like a professional after this interview. I don't give a shit particularly about you getting the hype, because one day this will boomerang back to you and I would love to see how your arse deals with it.
Trương Khánh	No matter what, he is always a part of EXO. And I hope that his dad and him gonna have a better relationship
Cirine Trabelsi	i feel like all these questions were inappropriate to ask like stop asking him about his father when he already told you there is no contact????  and the way he was asked to talk about exo,,, idk why but it made me feel uncomfortable watching it
TaeM Ochi	I never knew he was in Exo, I loved his music as a soloist and I find that inspiring that he knew his path and decided to stop
Chaeyoung Eva	Im crying right now .. why he is just asking him about his dad  .. T-T  its so emotional .. 😢
Eva Gaming	Hell yeah his voice is deeper than my ass
Annah Conda	this whole interview was so fucking disrespectful. it's supposed to be an interview about kris but nah lets just talk about his dad instead. props to kris for putting up with this bullshit. @ kris' management.. don’t play him so dirty next time.
Kim Bangtan Is A Bop	That hairstyle tho. .......wtf
eggtarteu xx	The questions this guy asked him was VERY RUDE.STOP IT RN OKAYYYYY
Dragon Butler	I wonder if his dad knows he’s an idol
Stream AIIYL Yooo	His reasons for leaving is so stupid. He is so inpatient. If he didn’t leave they could’ve allowed him to write music for his team just like they doing with chanyeol
しのむのひのがの	wth is happened to his hairstyle?!
Juana Kim	I miss you so much Yifan! I'm so proudddddd and you deserve all the love, I love you and we're always here for you❤
Nina Balante	when is part 2?
Gabriele Beard	Can the interviewer leave him alone about his dad?
Lord Gaia	LOL Kris/EXO Fans are funny. They probably never watched a Vlad Video and expect from Vlad to ask soft Questions. It's nothing compare to the other people that he asked about.
supriya hansda	Asking about his dad was definitely unnecessary. But he handled it well. So proud of you babe. Much love. ❤
MsTravelTheWorld	Who is Kris Wu? A brave little horse (Chinese zodiac) to dare to say NO to evil oppression and abuses that led the way for industry changes to benefit other artists, and a kind giant (his height ^_^) for humanity to bridge the East and the West (at least for hip-hop music side) one step at a time. His voice sings for his heart of truth.   Oh, I hope one day he will meet his dad again, and father and son unite. I'm sure he will. Of course though, he loves his mom so much that he will respect most certainly her will before that happens.
Aqsa	Damn u can tell how uncomfortable kris was feeling when he got into details About his dad. I love kris who. The fact that he treasures Exo means a lot to Exo and Exo-ls.
Charlee	I get being a celebrity, you’re going to get personal questions but the way he answered the first couple of dad questions it’s like ok interviewer give it a rest.  Put 2 and 2 together and let it go.  There’s only a few ways to say there is no relationship with his dad 🙄.  I mean I got uncomfortable 😬 Respect to kris for handling it so well.
انت حمار	Am so sad .because he didnt see his dad thats so sad
Ruxuan Ma	Why they doing that to him?! Isn’t that a like obvious,sensitive,and private question??! I mean he told you that he and he’s mom was separate from his dad?? God! The interviewers now a days tho!
sarah vivamus	MY PRECIOUS BABY MOONCHILD
Sean B	lmao @ these first timers getting mad at vlad not knowing he notoriously loves to focus on the lowest point of somebodys life. dope interview though dudes fanbase is active
NATASHAA CHOONG	Kris we miss you . 💝
Machi L	Great Kris!!! Si proud of you. ❤️🙂
Zayida Esmeralda	This interviewer is stupid. “Have you ever talked to your dad?” BRO HE SAID HE NEVER MET HIM. HOW COULD HE HAVE TALKED TO HIM?! 🤦🏻‍♀️
coffee jimin	I couldn't watch this. Ugh the cringe is so bad, get another interviewer please
Intan Jamaludin	Kris baby you're doing great! Also interviewer sir, you're an ass.
K-Pop Freak	He must have felt uncomftarble about the questions he asked about his relationship with his dad
Bea Abigail	Ayyyy EXO
ȘEHÚŇ ȘŢAŇ	I really missed you. Please come back to us as soon as we have never forgotten you and will not forget you because we consider you from exo   It is true that you are not in the band, but you still inhabit our heart, as well as tao and luhan. We have long lost you so much, and so much so.   So please tell us that we will take care of you so much and i forgot something important i won the arabs and we love you very much really and even when you let us understand how you got tired of me and finally i hope you can read me and answer me and i really love you and all the fans exol  💕💕💕💕💕💕😊💕💕💕💕💕💕👑👑👑👑👑❤❤❤❤❤😻😻😻😻 fayting

Katie Liu	Naega wolf naega wolf aoooohh a saranghaeyo
TRE STAYLIT	Yaw have weak skin. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Hargovind Gupta	Hey i am from India i am big fan of kris
Ren __	This is the WORST interview I ever watch.   They should build a good atmosphere, so the interviewee can talk comfortably, and you can see here.. kris feel a little bit UNCOMFORTABLE about some questions, but luckily kris is a humble person and answer the question kindly.   What a bad interviewer. He didn't even show his face. HAHA
Bi Ru Kai	What. The. Fuck. Who's this shitty interviewer?
SWAGATA MUKHERJEE	What these questions are?Ask about his career,why so much questions about dad?He is still a superstar without dad
Rima Rahman	THE INTERVIEWER CAN GET TO F*** HONESTLY U ARE SUCH A DISRESPECTABLE PERSON HOW CAN U ASK SUCH STUFF why u tryna open wounds broo KRIS HONEY JAGIYA dont ever come back to this interviewer
Natt H.	That interviewer is a giant bitch😧😧😒😒😒 dickhead
Happy Merry	this must be the worst interview ive watched. the interviewer sounds stupid. always bringing out the "dad". 😡😡😡😡
SCREWER AH	6:20  "yeah that time it was big absolutely"   Yeah bro exo is now shinking because the new album is a flop
Neny Chie	This is the fucking saddest video ever
Malsha K.	Why did Kris say Exo was huge back then? They’re still huge.
Greg Pittsy	Geez the interviewer is so fuckin annoying
Gilbert Ibuos	Yohhh.don't make Kris uncomfortable and just talk about to his Dad.I'm not an EXO-L and this is the first time I watched Kris speak in English and he speaks so passionately and he has a really deep voice yohhhh I wish they have a reunion
Aliya Maly	HIS ENGLISH IS SOOO FLUENT NOW
byun baek	kris deserves better than to be interviewed by you.
hao shang	Just go to his new album，Antares ，you will love it
Indira Dey	3:40 "For an Asian kid that's pretty tall" wtf is wrong with this interviewer.  Mister, for a human being ur pretty damn obnoxious.
Charlie Is a Scootaloo	I hate this interview tbh. Kris looked so uncomfortable, and faked smiled/laughed some of his personal questions off. You can tell we didn’t want to answer them, they did the same thing with Jay! Wtf?  I still LOVE You Kris.
QuencySVlogs	This is such a crappy interview why the hell yu asking personal questions like come son mad disrespect
basic elle	MISS U KRIS :,) ❤️
YoungbaeMadness	Ya'll kept digging and digging and digging and digging about his father..smh
Daniela Casaljay	Kris I really miss you😌😶.when I saw you,i click quickly this video💕,coz you are my idol💕😍.. I hope you've come back with EXO💕
kpopistakingoverme sendhelpto1234arenstreet	This whole interview is a complete mess the interviewer was making kris uncomfortable wtf
Yeolie Park	So handsome 💓
Akisha Nacino	we miss you!!💖
evelyn uwu	this interview is SO uncomfortable
薇潔朱	It's ok It's ok this is so very great man
Jennifer Cabante	I think he's already furious by questions. His facial expression quite changed.
jojoxoxo	I feel like it was so hard for him to talk about EXO :/ I mean yes not only did he leave and it was massive drama but I think at the end of the day the boys really meant a lot to him. Must have been so hard to leave all of them behind, even though it was definitely for the better 😕❤️
Exo_l we are one	ما تخطاش الحد ولا أنا برك حسيت    Wu yi fan you've got all of our hearts
Rylnn Indaeyo	He clearly said “No” you dumb ass fugly stupid moron
유베짱	Krisssss😭😭😭😭 ot12 Why is the interview asking questions that might be toooo personal??
Mochi _Suho	Man, the interviewer doesn’t know how to shut the fuck Up. Like seriously, Kris was so uncomfortable but he handled it like a pro❤️
min yeol	i miss u
Taehyung_Biased	*I hate the interviewer.*
Kristine Mae Dorado	As much as i want to know more personal stuff about kris., i hate hate this interview... half of this vid is about his father.... this should be about his music..!!! Like duuuuuuudddddde, you see how uncomfy he is with you asking thos dad questionsssss... he's being modest  by even trying to answer the questions.... dude.... you fuckin dont ask those questions... like helll!!!  My goodness... fans don't even ask those questions.... like who the heck are you???? Shit... just quit your job bro... you don't know how to do an interview....
Calvin Tai	This interviewer is asking too much personal and controversial questions.  Kris already said he never saw his dad, and the interviewer keeps on fking asking. S
Mareta Amanda	i can't bear to hear the rest of the interview
Who let He died	Fuck this interview. I think it is an interview not counseling about dad
Bts V	Respect for his mum ... she was able to raise a kid like that I think she is proud now
Fighter Phoenic	Im sure the mc who was asking question is egoistic and prideful...like the way hes asking question ..hes not giving a damn or any respect or sriousness.This is not the way to intrview a prson either great or small..are u newbie mc?
sad sushi	This interviewer has way too muhh confidence with these questions wtf
Byun Baekhyun	Wow, it feels weird to picture him in exo anymore. It’s been so long. I’m happy he’s doing well.  This made me wanna go rewatch exo’s showtime #ot12 <3
amy	he was so smiley throughout this interview and he handled every question so well, i love him so much
나민김	With the personal and past questions, i'm proud that kris answered everything with a smile and didn't get angry but at the same time i feel sad that he had to go through a lot. That interviewer needs to back off on those types of questions
feiran he	can they just stop asking questions about his ex-band? that just a period of life history... it has past almost 4 years......
Harshita Dubey	Love you my kris and Happy birthday God bless you for your future forever
chenchen cai	Who tf is the interviewer? What an asshole!
aerasn	I hate it when people keeps on asking things that are private, esp the past of a person. Stop asking abt Kris's dad, its too personal.
Lo An	Kris faced with all problem and please don't blame for him about the group because he left Exo when  they are in strength time.
INFIRE NAMJOONS PAPRIKA	ugh stop asking about his dad, it makes me uncomfortable because idk my dad as well so fucking disrespectful
Komachou	This dude did the same shit with Jay. It seemed so uncomfortable, but jay handled it professionally.
EL	so sad :'(
Qiuyu Fan	Why are you asking him those questions that hurt him the most? He's really uncomfortable when you were asking and don't even stop and keep on asking
Freda.e	Dude, what’s with the interviewer and his dad questions?! I barely know about Kris but dude, for an interview this is too personal. Kudos to kris for keeping his cool.
Kassandra Badua	Ot12💔
Taehyungsshi Army	his fake smile, my heart hurts! That’s stupid ass mc
Sanju	God bless you , Kris Wu. 🙏❤
Willow Millar	It's not right to expect him to reconnect with his father. It should be the other way around
Labliii 11	I love kris but why he always said yeah? hahahaha lmao.
Brittney Vang	One of the most awkward interviews I've seen with Kris in it...
nara heera	Honestly speaking the interviewer is so rude. Asking about his dad is one thing but he kept asking after kris said that his parents divorced when he's a baby. Please have some respect to someone's private life if you want to interview them.
Stan GOT7 Stan CoCo	Well, what can you expect from interviewers.... Kris looked really awkward
kris winkk	luv this guy😎
KN Victoria	The guy was asking too much. I can tell that Kris was really uncomfortable when the question was about his Dad his EXO..
みん	The interviewer is so fucking annoying omg
顾情安	cool an
GK	lol this interviewer and the tones he uses when he asks questions is so shit; he doesnt engage with anything that kris says lmaoooo "... okay" "right" "...yeah"
grow taller with hun-aah!!	i hate the interviewer sm— like, digging about his past (his Dad) :–) that's really an unnecessary thing to be asked.
Cathy Liu	KrisWu is so cool
Tina Chow	He is a good boy
씨렐	okay some people dont understand so imma make it clear, yall cant say that the man was asking too much questions about kris’ father and claim that it’s too private for him to tell in public or to the man, like uhh the main point of this video was to interview kris about his dad and how he became an idol so basically he had to ask questions. i mean kris wouldn’t just go there without knowing what the interview is about, right? course he knew the man was gonna ask questions bout his dad. and i dont see anything wrong with the things he had asked, and the uncomfortableness kris was feeling. he was even so chill and i think that he answered all the questions maturedly. BUT OKAY THANKS FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK YALL SUPPORT KRIS AND EXO AND STREAM TEMPO BYE
Leilanie Escobido	why... am I crying?? sh*t I should learn to move on 😭
layixing	he sounds and looks so uncomfortable but it’s nice to know that he treasured his moments with exo
Hey you	I get interviewers want to ask questions that no one else has asked and talk about issues that no one else does, but when you ask them personal questions and you can tell they don't want to talk about it, it's awkward for us to watch. I could have given a better interview with the little knowledge I have of Kris.
Rose Mary Calanag Ansay	OT12 HUHUHU We missed you so much.. My heart is crying right now. 😢 I hope one day they'll gonna meet up in one place and perform at least 1 song and and... This imagination makes me more sad 😔😭
exo suho	why you asking like that? omg kris fighting💪❤
stardust ☄	The interviewer seems like a typical Hollywood airhead that only cares about the views this will get at the end of the day. First and last video I’ll be watching from this channel. Tragic.
ikon jinan	you dun need to ask about his father gosh i hate that interviewer
Exh0e	I’m sorry but this is lowkey funny
whitney	this was gross the interviewer should be ashamed of himself
Kris fanfan	Support kris forever
Dieu Nguyen	Vietsub please....
LADY bloom	thank you bro
yeaxjustsmile20	Dj Vlad really knows how to make me cringe
Galaxy_ Gemstones	Keep fighting.I'm really cheer and support you.The end I were love you from the méi gè nî.😊😊
Kazzandrah Ros	OMG kris:(((
Chloe Duvall	Does the interviewer wanna ask one more question about his dad? I mean come on, he clearly said the first time he has no contact with him. Why keep digging...
Paola Wu	Love you loves 😍😍😍
Louisse Raye	he looks awkward when the interviewer asked about his dad :(((
Ur mum loves BTS	I love how Kris handled the questions about his past very professional and the title of the video is kinda off
Indie last name	wHY on earth did he keep pushing the whole dad topic ffs!!! does he not have any people skills??? like surely you could fucking tell how uncomfortable you were making kris feel! 😡😡😡 terrible interviewer.
Film Won's	Why is the interviewer so stupid and ask too much dad question what is your problem leave my hunnney alone
Alice Feng	ugliest piece of shit ever
byun hye ran	he's laugh is kind a cute and im proud of him for handling the question about his father
Sweet Angel	Man I don't like his style. He looks so much better with a clean haircut and dress nice you know. Back in the EXO days he was the most coolest and good looking of all the members but what's going on with him.
Yazzitsmee	Kris voice sound like a sweggy  robot lol
Angie is always watching	Why’d they keep asking the same questions about his dad  I get it if they’re just asking him once about it respectively but like they need to chill
Kpop Forever	I am glad kris can be the true him now
Kim Marshall	The vibe from this interviewer is off! Get it together mate! But heyyyy Kris 💋
Shahla	dang this triggers me like Jay Park interview
Exo-L 17	wow this interview
Kim Suckjin T_T	Dont show this to Suho
Maryam Razzack	This interviewer did NOT do his research at all.
Brahim Bekairi	He Never love exo i sewar
A Person Named Lady	Reading some of these comments, it's the Jay Park video comment section 2.0 🙄   *Watch other VLAD videos and calm yourselves down.* This is how it goes, if the artist doesn't want that, he could do interviews with other channels. Go to Vlad, and this is what you get. Enjoy the insight, fellow viewers! Well... I haven't watched the video yet :-D
Fatiya Azzahro	Ge, i miss you so much😭😭😭😭❤
tenchichrono	Wow.  I liked this interview a lot.  It helps you understand Kris more.  I respect him a lot more because of this interview.
kerexu	I guess his family background explains his personality. He is really independent and don't take shit from others. knowing his mother raised him by herself makes me admire her character and perceive kris in a way more positive light than I already do.  I hope he agreed beforehand to those questions, if not it's really inconvenient.
Lena	This interviewer,  I hope you read the comments because you were doing to much with these invasive ass questions.  He told you he hasn't seen his dad, should have left it at that.
Louise Wood	This interviewer is dumb. Just dumb.
Jiayin Chen	I love getting to know more about Kris but I hope he didn’t feel as uncomfortable as the whole interview looked
Chiara Dewanto	damn kris handled this interview really well because i don't feel like the interviewer is asking relevant or polite questions. kris really is That Bad Bitch tho, hope he keeps up tht good shit💞
Luna Bae	The questions about his father were really unnecessary. I could feel how uncomfortable he was. Even talking about SM seemed easier.
ain't yo senpai	Came in YT to support EXO's comeback "Tempo" and ended up crying watching lots of OT12 moments and what Kris said here made me BADLY MISS THEM SO MUCH LIKE LITERALLLYYYYY CAN WE GO BACK TO THOSE PRECIOUS MOMENTS 😭😭😭
Kim Elly	He said Yeah 55 times bitch i counted
Seve Lohe	💗💗💗💗
arisaaa a	The interview makes him uncomfortable
TTzChan99	Congratulations on #1 Galaxy!😘💞👍👍
ryi neng sang	Feels good to hear him talking about exo..I was an exo-l back at times in the ot12 era..but with so many members leaving the group I kind of lost my interest in them.. maybe someday I or rather the whole fandom I guess would like to see them doing a reunion or smthng like that😊
Electric Aubry	I'm really mad at this interviewer. Kris told you the first time they never talked. Then he keeps asking him if they have and any pictures. Shut the fuck up and move on. Don't make him answer any questions he doesn't want to answer.
Manasandkook Talkers	Interviewer = GIANT Dick
Don’t Doubt TTM	I feel like they shouldn’t push the questions too far, I feel bad that he has to answer all those uncomfortable questions.
Hun Afifa	i still loving him till now 😭 i miss ot12 😭
Tiffany Bo	very good
Syaziey Zaidi	asking such personal questions were terrible idea. seriously. absurd.
M Lin	Love you！Aways
언니조	I'm very proud of you Kris Wu Yifan. I'll support and love you till the end. Jiayou! Fighting! Oh Btw, Mr.Vlad you have to be careful with your questions.😢😭💔
Cherry Ngai	I only love my Guangzhou boy.😭
Pavlina Efth	How cUte
Ooh Daddyy	yall talking about him being asked uncomftable quostions (which i agree on)  but can we talk how good he looks and how cute his smile is
coffeepinklove	I'm sorry, but what is the purpose of doing this interview cuz the questions are so uncomfortable. Kris is doing a great job by handling this type of questions especially about his dad.
NCT 127 I ONLY KNOW A NTC 127	Interesting interview. I had never really heard Kris talk about his dad or EXO a whole lot. To the people complaining about the interviewer being invasive: that’s standard for interviews here. I mean, have y’all ever watched a Barbara Walters interview?? His past shaped his present. It’s relevant.
Savanah Louise_2327	Why did this video made me cry 😭💗 I cried after hearing the EXO thing hahaha
Xiao Wei	The interviewer is a big douch 😳 like wtf man, have some respect
赵晓萱	Hope people can notice more his new album
Haliza Layla Tsabita	Name of the programs?
estrella wolfsohn	Poor baby:( the interviewer had no respect, he asked way too much questions about his dad. Kris seemed so uncomfortable
ImogenFAQ	So smart so nice👏👏👏listening to your new album <Antares>🎶🎶🎶
Mia Qistina	I'M CRYING :)
Jennie Lil	I am  a huge fan of yours
EXO-L Family	Thank you because asked about EXO
Amber S	Can they like not ask questions like that like for real how will you feel if you if someone ask those questions i will be pissed! I feel so bad for him :'(
Todoki 22	My Cool City Guy Forever😁😇
makayla b	this interviewer is horrible?? he’s rude and awkward...

R F	Love you kris , you worked hard and thank you for hard work 🤗 love you love you love you love you 😍
Sam Gray	this seems more like a counselling session than an interview
Jayward Punzalan	Imissyouuuuu soo baddd . 😥 Takeeecaree alwaysss iloveeeyou yifann no matter whatt
Leemin Ho	Am I the only one who noticed thst kris changed a lot, I mean physically
Please stan Cross gene CandY	Pause at 4:11...He is so done😂
Ivy Feng	I want to hug him. π_π
Anika Tabuada	so proud of kris. i still whole heartedly support him even if he left exo. Im happy he appreciates everything in rhe past and still thankful he experienced with exo
FireOfHikaru	"Be a doctor or lawyer" lmao every Asian parents

Sakiii	6‘1? Isnt he like 6‘3 or something
Yoongi's gummy smile	Sorry but not sorry I just wanna punch the interviewer on his face!
Niken L. D.	don't mess up my tempo man
Jeojeol Heol	OhMAYGHADEUUUU
DRAKE REDUBLA	Still cool as ever. Everything he said seemed to be like a rap hahaha.
GroteskAntichrist	I love Kris and I’m really happy he’s doing solo. SM is just blocking talent and creativity. I see Kris as a solo artist and not as a former member of EXO. And I think that is what he also wants.
Yalie Racquel	i remember the day the news about his departure from exo broke out, i literally had a mental and emotional breakdown. there were alot of things circulating around the internet about it, and it didn't matter if it was true or not but my poor young and vulnerable exo fangirl heart had its own defense mechanism for the whole situation and i just chose to believe what felt like the most comforting during that time. four years later on today, i feel like i've matured enough to atleast understand what happen back then. he just really wanted out of exo, wanted a career path for himself but chose the wrong time to do so.. they were having their first concert just days before he left the whole team and fandom hanging and it was a whole mess. i would've appreciated it more if he was honest enough to own up to his decision on why he left back then but i also understand why he couldn't. and here, we finally hear the reason straight from him-- he just wanted his own *freedom,* to be able to do the things he wanted to do without maximum restrictions. and honestly, its just great to see him doing his own thing and exo doing their own thing. i guess it still worked out for both parties in the end.  also, on a side note, the whole dad thing in this interview was too much. i understand that its intriguing and yea maybe interesting but its also kinda off limits. he never really mentioned about his dad often and it must've been awkward sitting through an interview being asked about a person you have the least idea of in your entire life. but im just happy he got through this entire interview. and i got through watching this even though its kinda painful to watch 💀
arya s	This interviewer is sick
ANN QIU	what makes me more proud of him is that he nwver did say anything bad about exo after he left. if he dont answer anything about it from media, he also say few good things and now he was actually more open about it and hearing that he treasures the memories makes me more proud and that i never regret that he became my first ever bias in exo. i love yoy galaxy fan! ❤
Hellissou xg	1:52 that laugh tho cutie 😂💕
Lestlie Gape	we love u kris. we also treasured the moments of you when ur are with exo and till today!!!
dywe huang	Kriswu  is a  tough boy.
kisskimkai	idk why i started tearing
EXO L Ariee	I like that's "hehehe"
소시Sarah	Is it only me who gets annoyed by that host? He is quite rude!
slob kabob	What a douche bag. He kept asking about the whole dad thing. It’s so uncomfortable being asked like that. Stop digging. Gosh. PRIVACY
Kris Alexa	yeah yeah yeah😂😭
strllgrc Segundo	I/WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU KRIS, EXO-L's and even your fans will always be here for you. 😘❤❤
Youssra Jose	Awkward 😑😑
Jongins Thrust	his smile is so adorable tho
Jessica Angela	beside the point of the rude interviewer and ot12 feels, my attention is also focused on his smexy pink plump lips and his messy shapeless hair. ma boi u need a haircut want u too look like outta manga again
brittney brandt	this interviewer was such trash. why not talk about his  amazing career???
Lê Dương	💖💖💖💖
good evening.	c....chogiwa brother.... chogiwa
milksomecows	Not only is the interviewer asking questions that are irrelevant to Kris' music career, the questions are also really insensitive and the answers kind of private. Plus, the way he asked the questions is really weird. There were no emotions used in his speech. Poor interview...
Suho looks like a pineapple	Those glasses reminds me of that orange juice.
Tanaka	HE'S SO FUNNY? 😂😂😂
IGOT7 WITHGOT7	Why The Fuck You Asked Him These Question He Is Trying To Move On
爱丽丝	I live in Vancouver ahhhhhhh
elf_ grxce	When he said 12 members, what ran through his mind was probably how it became 11 only after he left, then to the ot9 now :") i really hope the interviewer didn't purposely say 11 just to incite his response out of kris because he is already disrespectful enough
Emma	lol my guy definitely skimmed a wikipedia article about kris before this interview wtf
Jessica C	People are getting all up about asking "disrespectful" questions but honestly, would you rather him ask the same questions that EVERYONE else asks him that we already know the answers to? It's the first time that anyone ever asked him direct questions about his dad, instead of dancing around this question.  Sure, they're rather provocative and probing but artists draw on their own feelings, emotions and experiences to influence their craft. It's part of Kris' identity and family and home are some major themes in some of his music and what he talks about. I think it gives interesting insight into Kris as an artist, as a human being because a child's relationship with his parents (or lack thereof) can be rather telling.  It makes me wonder how much of a pain point it is for Kris, not having a father figure in his life. In my eyes, it makes him more human, less like the superstar celebrity image that is projected in China.
Kris Bordon	I can feel that his a bit uncomfortable talking about everything his asking. But by the way Kris voice is fucking making me pregnant
Fulla Haliwel	He was so uncomfortable... I can see that charming smile hide a thousand tear😭😢. My poor baby... Can u plz don't push in those questions that dig dip in old scar😷
Feysdoms Perkweys	this makes me uwu :'<
tayaballama	ya hear that? he doesn't hate them, he's grateful for the experience OK now go drink your milk
Sara Intharath	OT9! EXO!
Angel rose	How many times did he said "yeah"?
Kristel Fae ii	it's part of the past - Kris
Baek's Nutella	'So proud of you galaxy fanfan! Miss you so much 💕💕 Keep doing what you're doing! You're doing great on your own career. Aja!!

Bty Y8n	Wanna hug him 😭 also Kris Wu x Jay Park collab pls ♥️
autembor	That was very inconsiderate asking him about his dad. He was so uncomfortable 1:36
Hajar m	Bitch stop talking about his dad!!!! What the fuck is wrong with this shitty interviewer
Nanda Anis	Kris😭
Wishes Official	Kris: Twelve members in total.   I don't know why but that hit me. He remembered T_T. I wanna feel happy because today, EXO's album will be released (not to mention they're nine), but this just showed up and yeah, I saw Kris so why not? I didn't know this will make me feel sad, I don't know. - BAEKYEON
Amber's Chest	The title itself and the questions about his dad are way past the limit
anime fangirl	Honestly he sounded like he had a British accent at the beginning
honey thet	stay strong my king
Soh Hyeon	He handled the unnecessary and intrusive questions so well. His mother would be very proud of the boy she raised.
Katherine James	i’m jumping this nigga. period
Zenneth Dela Cruz	He lost his smile when the interviewer suddenly started the question with "You joined this group---" fvck! pain is creeping whyyyyyyyyy
Jake okok	He looks so derpy Lmao
Maryem Chan	This interview is just too much .. digging so much about his dad is not good , he should've just stopped when he told him they got divorced , but i'm glad to see him doing okay even though he looks really tired ..
Kiki	This is an interview not a documentation about his life the dad questions went a little to far he obviously doesn’t wanna talk about it if he wanted to he would of already done so
YUTA'nın GAMZESİ	WU YİFAN    I LOVE YOU❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nica De Guzman	Toooooo many private questions I am crying cause I felt the feeling how u never actually met ur father u don't know what he looks like and u never talked to him and just wonder hiw it feels like to have one... Like,I dont even know his name...talking about it always makes me cry he is so strong to talk about that and his past members....
Tinotenda Sandra	Oh my goshhhh! Stop asking him all these private questions about his dad. Literally you can see him being uncomfortable. Like are y'all here to talk about his personal life or his music or what? Seriously, shit is so annoying.
kathy sturluson	oh shit he made it to djvlad
Sexcy Ashh	This broke my heart☹But still Kris did a good job as a Father of EXO either🙂💕
Krungy Exo	He's still the cold but cool guy.  I love him!
帅雨汐	说的啥 居然提到了exo
riley grace	Why tf is he pressuring his father? Like maybe he doesn’t want to talk about it. Wtf omg
Min Hermiognie	pleeaase interview Luhan and Tao like dude ITS A MUST
dance monster	"THE INTERVIEW WHERE EVERY QUESTION LEADS TO HIS DAD"
Styles and Sprouse	He looks really uncomfortable.
kei	was it the interviewer's intention to make kris uncomfortable with all the questions about his dad? he was really insisting... i hated that.
exodrea61yangyang	Who watched the program wherebhe was in and there was a contestant who sang overdosed?
Karra Solomon	Idk y i want to see a reaction from exo watching this but then again i dnt want them to get into trouble or cry 😭😭
Nicolee 00	I feel closer to him
Lauren Liu	"youre 6'1"!" "yeah" "thats pretty tall for an asian kid" uh stereotypes? so disrespectful?
Mystomi	These questions thou......
1cutefreak	The interviewer could've put more thought into wording his questions :( Glad Kris handled it well.
TT _TT	I need more movies from himmmmmm he’s so beautifulllll 😍😍😍
Shar Paw	This is the most awkward interview everrrr
Scarlet Empress	I can see in his face, he's not comfortable with the situation
Karen Du	Kris didn’t seem to respond with very smart answers; but normally he is a wiser person than he was in this interview.
Welsy Chae	Did the dude just ask about kris's dad? What the fck?
big nig	This dude was really going deep in the questions with his dad. That man wanted to dig ALL the way to the roots with Kris' dad
Shu Qin	Interviews that are very uncomfortable. Interviewers ask questions and interact without mechanical interaction. Very impolite behavior.
Mica Garcia	I wish I can choke the interviewer myself.
♔KPOP BOSS♔	This was great!! Looking fwd to the rest of the interview. Proud of you, Kris! <3
Dragonfly	He looked so uncomfortable, poor guy.
M C	It makes roll my eyes every time an interview asks Kris “so u where born in China” like fans already know that and he’s said it in 100 different interviews, ask something else.
NotYourYear	for this interview and for Jay Park's this dude is just so stuck in the past! like, ask them about what they're doing now, what they plan for in the future, what they have been doing in recent times, COME ON! They don't want to talk about their pasts and most likely, their not legally allowed to share a lot of information about it anyway! This interviewer needs to learn to pick up on signs and read body language/facial expressions to know when it's not okay to continue on with a topic or a question.....
Serra Rojas ._.	All these dad questions got me fucking cringing! Like what kind of disrespectful person are you ?
KOok'Kaii	❤You're Good Boy, My KrisWu. 😊
Mystic	You should stop asking them about their private life.
chococc99	I'm waiting for part 2
오물 오물	아 제발 둘기가 엑소 언급하는것 좀;;;;;; FUCK🤬🤮
king haechan	so basically the interviewer ask the most disrespectful questions about his dad, exo in general his past... but my lil bean never loses his smile (even it’s a bit fake at some parts) and keep being nice.  i stan the right person.  but it’s really cute how he corrects him with exo.
Sniffthisblossom	hes so cute
Kirana Ldp	He likes being in EXO 😿 he just need a freedom to choose his type of music
JeeMaeil	I got angry when he kept asking about his father like let a guy breath man
Jun Han	YOU FORGOT MY MOM!!! I HAVE TO BE THE FIRST IN CLASS OR NO INTERNET DO YOU REALIZE HOW HARD IS THAT??? LIKE I'M 20 YEARS OLD AND THERE ARE OTHER SMART PEOPLE IN MY CLASS (ONLY ONE) BUT SERIOUSLY MY MOM USED TO TELL ME WHEN I WAS 8 Y.O TO START THINKING LIKE A FREAKING DOCTOR AND LOOK AT ME NOW HUH!!! I'M STUDYING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I CAME SECOND IN CLASS LAST YEAR SHE STILL DOESN'T RECHARGE MY DATA AHHHHHHH I'M SO ANGRY!!!!! MOM I'M YOUR YOUNGEST YOU SHOULD TREAT ME FAIRLY LIKE YOUR OTHER GIANT KIDS OMG I SHOULD STOP NOW....
felix lover	Dj:soooo you wher in a grop a boy grop Kris:yup Dj:it whas EXO Kris:.... Who is EXO?
BORN TO SLAY	note to yourself : DO NOT GO TO VLAD !
a big fan	damn.... I mean I should have expected it to go like this with this tittle and after  watching jay park's interview but... that was awkward
Alice Shin	Kris might have had the musical position of a rapper and sub-vocalist in EXO but to all the EXO-L put there who still care about OT12, he was our Duizhang
Alex	Kris always makes talking about exo so awkward, I know he doesn't like to talk about it...but you think he'd be used to the questions coming up by now.
Hello F	Can he stop with the dad questions!! That’s pretty annoying and kris looks uncomfortable there!!
Jasmine Flores-Jimenez	They didn’t have to ask him about his dad and all, he clearly looks uncomfortable.
Shannon Mc	I don’t even stan and I know that this was hard interview
wishing you godspeed	Please ask more questions about THE ACTUAL MUSIC and not about his personal life. He was just a child and no one chooses how they grow up. It really doesn't matter. Just acknowledge him for all his work and accomplishments! He's an amazing artist and truly deserves all our love and support!  I agree with everyone who said he did a well job at answering the questions. He stayed positive and on-point. He's so sweet! Love you Kris! 💛
Nadra KJI	Yo yo kris wu is the best  And wtf!! Wtf is the interviewer doing
my baby gorl you already know	take a shot everytime he says yeah
Malsawmi Hmar	I find this so disrespectful...why is he asking him about his dad without any hesitation...he ain’t feeling sorry or what?? Although Kris is having a calm expression...i feel sooo bad 😭😭

Punbabell EXO-Lufans OT12 분빱일 !	OT12 forever💋
Sheila Amolo	He's so cute I can't!
Lucy R	Ok. Ok. Ok. Do these “okays” ever stop? I’m quite annoyed that the interviewer kept pushing with questions about his dad. Why bring it up in the first place and why ask and ask and ask?? But anyways, I’m so proud of Kris and I just hope someday there will be a reunion and all of OT12 are there.... ❤️
Saianna Sweet	I don’t really like it. I mean... this are really personal questions and I don’t think that it was himself who told that he wants to do this kind of interview...
Superneo	Omg I'm one minute into the video and stopped like wtf was with the interviewer asking so much about Kris' father. Even the tone of his voice sounded disrespectful. Kris must've felt uncomfortable asf oml

ZTao the little Kitten	Omg It's good to know more about him How he really felt when he was in Exo It's good to see him smile and laugh😊He used to refuse to talk about these kinds of stuff But he's opened up The tea is  so hot Kris Wu😁
Kyungsoo Yaa	I miss Kris but I’m so happy to see that he become big and confident with himself. He do what he want and it is great tho.  The interviewer is so rude to ask him about his privacy stuff. So annoying.
Jane Lee	why the MC keep asking his dad......
Ajusshi leader	When the interviewer asked if Exo had 11 member and he automatically corrected it to 12 😭❤️
Eve RyLin	mystery solved.
army fotmife	He pushed too far with the dad thing
Jannat Ahmed	Bless Kris
TheRoseR nate	Even I got it the first time, when Chris first expressed his dad was not part of his life... talk about prying
Yiling Wei	怎么红红的

Henry Shi	It's more like a job interview...You can tell he gets a little bit nervous and uncomfortable
Anita Carolina	OMG😱
Rerkwaris Vorachat	So rude at the beginning. Why do you have to ask about his dad so many question?!?
Mazur Mia	Не нужно было задавать ему такие вопросы, да он уже не ребенок но все же...видно что Крису было не совсем удобно.Особенно когда он заговорил об папе.
Aica Bunagan	I miss you Kris. But I am so proud of everything you have achieved. I will still continue to support you 😊
Shippermatic	I feel sad tho
Lee Soo Man	I really hope these questions were approved with Kris before being asked.

Din 2	What is this therapy season??? What's with the private questions?
Srzahra	You guys are the worst! WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF WE ATTACK YOU GUYS WITH THAT KIND/SENSITIVE QUESTION! RUDE!!!
xxdoby	POOR KRIS. STOP TALKING ABT HIS PRIVACY. STUPID DUMBASSS
EXO Kai is my Michael Jackson	Why does the MC keeps on asking about his father, respect his privacy please
Koko_ B.A.B.Y	if kris falls in love with a girl he will never gonna leave her ....  love u WU YIFAN > <
Lovelyz Baby Soul, The one, The legend	Whenever I think of EXO ot12 my heart hurts especially since I was mostly an Exo-M stan. To see Kris, then Luhan and then Tao all leave it was heartbreaking. I’m so glad that all 12 are still doing amazing and making big moves. Special props to Kris who really made it work cuz it could’ve very easily gone south.
اميرة ابي	😭😭😭😭😭❤

Mia Fitriyanti	quit the dad talks! it's so invading!!
Emiline729	I love the fact that despite being screwed over by the company we won't name, he still talks nicely about EXO and the fact that he appreciates that it helped start his career. I really hope to see Kris continue to gain more love and respect.
Rita Hagberg	interviewer needs to find a new profession. leave this baby alone!!!!
I love kris and Chanyeol Exo-l	I love you Kris Wu😘
julietsoddeye	I wanna hug him so bad talking about his dad like that. I wish they didn't have to ask such intimate part about his life. He's selling his music, not his privacy. 😭😭😭
aliya s	kris jawab semuanya padahal sakit pasti kalo dia ingat tentang ayahnya, tentang exo. mau peluk kris😭😭😭
Chan Ouksakphea Noem	I miss you idol com back Exo

MessiJinExoLoonaBigtimerush NamjinCressi	Oh how I miss him in exo 😭😭😭
Yang Yang	加油凡凡，你的过往成就现在的你
effi ka	Disrespectfull. It's like seeing someone in the street and start asking him/him question about his private life. He might be famous but I'm pretty sure nobody wants to awnser such questions when they're asked from a random person. People only talk about such things with close friends. I'm very mad. He is famous so why don't ask common questions and not ones that make him feel uncomftable?
Rhada Wu	I really love you Kris!
따따둔	ㅌㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ걍딴사람됐네..동일인물인지몰름ㅌㅋㅋ 진짜 완전 중국사람같음

chaeyoung bae	STOP. TRYING. TO. CONNECT. EXO. WITH. HIM. it’s been 4 fuckin years and best to forget it
Kierra Stelly	Wow, you don’t ask a person that. Even if you are famous that’s way to personal.
jane Ma	he is so cute！
dyororo EXO	Almost of the comments are EXO-Ls and Kris Wu probably readin all of our comments.
Jan J	I'm so glad Kris is doing well Exo L still love you and will always wish you the best
Jennifer Deng	That title about Kris and his father. When Kris was talking about his father, I got a bit emotional.   But, I am so proud of Kris being where he is now. His new songs and collaborations are just amazing.
Vanessa Darkness	Господи, как я люблю этого человека ~
i want to die	the dad part made me so uncomfortable like stop pressing him for answers its so weird man this aint ur life
Jemaa Nessa	This interviewer pushes such uncomfortable questions. You ask the dad question once, fair enough, but move on. This isn’t Dr. Phil. He did that with Jay too 🙄
IME’s Wonderland	My heart is in peices
Yer C	Did this interviewer really ask about his dad like that
vegan soul	Shit... his that is shit why the interviewer found some interesting in that fact?
kellycappuchino101	3:43 actually, chinese people are relatively tall. Theyre basically average american height but quite a few are taller. Koreans are slightly shorter than chinese Japanese is VERY short, and then southern asian countries are the shortest.
Hermela Belay	Go Kris. Fight the Shit. Also EXO FOREVER.
M a	I LOVE YOU KRIS 😭😭❤

Paula Sabina Viloria	I'am so glaad he's talking about his whole experience in sm like its a blessing in disguise, he deserve all the blessings. Sml to kris and luhan.
Krystal Zhang	Li Jiaheng's mom really raised him well, his is respectful, calm and independent, I salute his mom and him💖💗💘
bao yang	I don't like the interview guy. He ask stupid question. What he try to know about Kris Wu?
kris wu's derp face is my style	Kris is smiling but here I am crying😭
Aye Christy	“That’s kinda talk for an Asian”.... There are millions of Asians that are tall asf. Welcome to kpop.
Gloria Lin	6:19 i can't believe hes talking about exo
Limarenla Sanglir	"KRIS UWU"
Zeze Hassan	He is so cute 😍😍
i stan	No offense but i do not know why people keep prying into the reason he left exo or his family life.  He kept it private for a reason and we should all respect that. Fans or not
Doggy BlackDoggy	Please do not mention exo any more. We don't want anything to do with you. You are a traitor.
java20009 mason	awkwaaaaaaaaaaaard..............
Stár Subie	Stay strong Kris🌌
Sky Rebecca	Always love you Kris 😘 #SendingAllLoveAndBlessingFromIndia💞
HollyHoseok	I feel like he’s uncomfortable with these questions 😔
cham quang	Anh là quá khứ của EXO, và EXO cũng là quá khứ của anh. Sẽ luôn nhớ đến nhau dù qua đi bao mùa comback và nhận giải
Dara Budiman	I love you kris
fdoctor	Really dude?!? You are REALLY reaching with dad questions? Let's focus on his future. POSITIVITY!
TalioniesRex	Somehow I feel like this interview is so awkward.  tell me I'm not the only one. He seems so uncomfortable.
DO TY	I love the smile draen on his face when says 'yeah the big time' (talking about EXO OT12 success) makes me smiles. I know and I feel it, deep down gis heart, I know Kris has still a lot of respect for EXO :) And this just makes me love him more. Kris Wu will always be our Mr. Galaxy :) *'Chicken is not my style'* but actually eats chicken 😊😉😄😘
asherrine_khleinh	Wahhh! I'm crying! Ot12!
sofia benitez	❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
LikeOrigami	The interviewer is good at his job, that job being a dirty past digging journalist lol. Nothing wrong with that, but he keeps applying pressure on topics that are irrelevant and makes them uncomfortable. Did the same thing to Jay Park. It's different from other interviewers, but makes the interviewee uncomfortable.
Cezanne Dutta	When the reporter said,"there were 11 of you?" Kris: *triggered*
Suhocidal	Whiny ass OT12 bitches: *THIS ISN’T WEEKLY IDOL, GET OVER YOURSELVES*
Shin Wu	my heart...😭😭😭😭 i missed u
IvanRussiaBraglinski	Yeah I didn’t really like how the interviewer was digging for info about his dad, Kris looked visibly uncomfortable 🙁 I’m really happy he seems to be a little more okay about talking about EXO, I wish we could’ve gotten a little more info about it all but I also don’t want him to be uncomfortable, hopefully he’ll tell us when he’s ready, this has given me a little bit of closure. We love and support you kris!!
Mai pao	I mean , was neccesary ask him about his father and  also put it in the tittle of the video 🙄??
Nayara Gabrielly	yeah 28228x
Eht	Those question about his dad are too unnecessary...
Farhana Syafiqah	Can the interviewer just stfu omg stop pushing him
Mi W	Although he was asking questions that was emotional for Kris, I think he can get past it by simply letting it out and moving on.  Many kids grow up fine with one parent.  I learned something about Kris I never knew.  It makes him more relatable and shows how he Still excelled.
Norsyaza Edmiza	I only know kris wu in exo, once his out, i dont know him anymore
Nisa pcy's	Kris? ....
Where's My Oppa?	So was this interview with Kris Wu? Or interview him for 5 mins about his dad... You acting like it’s not normal to not grow up with your dad...  💀💀
Kanza Shinji	I miss Kris in EXO 😭😭😭
Candy Mak	This dj did a terrible job interviewing kris  1. Asking sensitive questions repeatedly and u can tell he was awkward  2. Did not research before the interview  3. 11 Members ?? Did not no he was a rapper in the group  Please do ur homework before hand it’s embarrassing
Lala JG	Not even a whole minute in, and the level of unprofessionalism... FAR BEYOND. Man, who let's this dude interview people. Terrible way to approach the questions and the fact that Kris is kinda awkward, makes it even worse.
Jimin's Shiteu	I'm sorry if i'm offending any one but i think this interviewer asked kris many questions about private things like about his dad like he was pushing it and you can tell kris was uncomfortable while answering
Ezmer	I'm just happy exo and kris are chill with each other, its just SM 😒
Ellen Junhae	I seriously love Kris and he's also from Canada  yasss
Qian_qian	Is it only me who find this interview really awkward ?
HALI	I hate this interviewer.   the awkward gaps of silence... :/
Shimmie Shimmie KokoComeback where are you	Why the fuck he's asking all those dad questions, what's wrong with you man??
HOI YING MA	Haters only know his name, but know nothing about his story
KO KO BOP	OML WHAT KINDA QUESTIONS 😐
My96 Moments	HE DOESN'T KNOW HIM MATE. GET OVER IT. THIS AIN'T THERAPY. THE INTERVIEWER IS SO RUDE IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
Bundle of E'dawn	*He's so adorable I miss him so much😭😭💕*
-SUGA addict-	smh the interviewer shouldn’t have been prying at kris for stuff about his dad but I’m glad he was able to handle everything well and he deserves so much 😔❤️
Limario	I miss you Kris ❤
frixikwon the most beautiful author	I'm so sad about his dad but _he looks pretty fine_
AgustD Suga	I mean why you gotta keep asking him the same shit you literally can see in his eyes that he doesn’t like the fucking question when he said he never met him means he never did why you gotta keep pushing like wow you never met him like it’s a big dam deal smfh😒
yanlingmarsh	Kris’s new album - Antares released 2 November 2018 on iTunes, a very unique album that you should have it, you won’t regret.
ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ윤아	I'm chogicrying
Rad Lord	I’m crying so much my ot12 heart :’)
dotokkidoki	the way he talks about exo. 😭👏🏻 i love you kris. keep doing you 🤞🏻
96NightRider96	Well I'll see you in 2022 when the contract is null and void and we can get the full story without risk of backlash from SM
yanxoo - elaine	I'll never stop supporting and caring about you Kris ❤
525 000	The real reason he left is because he knows he will earn MUCH more in China, where the market is bigger and he doesn't have to share his money with 11 other people.
Worldwide Handsome	He's a amazing person, a amazing artist, I love he's songs so much, I really appreciate and admire him.. you can see that he is grateful for everything, he knows the beginning of everything, and will never forget about nothing, that's admirable ❤️
aysha femin	Whats wrong with interviewer , why he is obsessed with kris's dad
AlohaDiana	haven't seen mullets around for a while...
Victoria-R .G	Yo this is personal ish man, leave my boy Kris alone 😐
drewbrooks	Joining exo was his biggest achievement, the fact he left and thought he could do better alone is the funniest shit ever considering he has no talent and the brain of a rock
R I T A	he’s so cute when he’s talking about things he’s passionate about i love him
xxjinn	Some questions were kinda rude .... I love how Kris awnsered them in a good way
Alexander Chan	Man you are one disrespectful interviewer, first and last time ill ever watch this channel.
PeterPan Amy	so disrespectful
MURTAZA QURESHI	He has changed so much  Cant match him with kris wu of Exo
Kpop lover	The questions that you’re asking are so disrespectful
Josh wang	whats fucking wrong with the interviewer？STOP asking questions about his dad especially when he said his parent got divorced！ Im not a fan of Kris but the interviewer is so gross and offensive. And for ASIAN kids and ASIAN kid？WTH？ Thoses stereotypes are really disgusting. Plz do some work before interviewing the celebrity!  Stupid ass.
jxck lovable	i thought the title said Kris Wu talking about becoming a father 💀💀 i was liKE HE’S GONNA HAVE A CHILD, WHY HAVEN’T I FOUND OUT ‼️
CameliaJDH	Idk what kind of scope the interviewer is trying to get out of the father issue . It's not necessary at all . If you are curious, ask about it out of the interview . I praised Kris for being professional and still smiling while answering . It's hard for him to explain what he really feels esp with the EXO topic but my OT12 blossomed when he mentioned 12 members . And I'm glad he is saying the truth about no freedom in music ; the main reason he left . He explained well regarding the whole situation . Good job, Kris Wu !
徫豪	Yeah that time was big yeah actually...  I cried after he said this😭😭
MissProducer 101	Kris is an angel 😍❤️
Random Panda	He is so cute in this video. Almost like a child.
Lizzy Pachuau	These questions were too personal and jumped way over the boundary
Maria Clara Blanch	Im so sad with this interview, Kris Wu is a very talented guy, and this interviewer was so incisive about his dad. Kris cant speaks about his new songs, or his movies, about "how is your next works?" Because the interviewer only wants to talk about personal things, that made kris become clearly uncomfortable. My heart is broken. I love you Kris! ♡  (Sorry for my bad english, im trying my best)
Alondra Ceja	This voice is so sweet but the interviewer needs classes on how to interview artist 😪 I feel uncomfortable with the way he asks questions like he wasn’t paying attention to what Kris says😪😔
Taekookie 05	I understand you guys want to know specific things in his life, but I feel bad for kris cuz these questions are really uncomfortable 😣
The Mole On V's Nose	Coming from the same situation as Kris, I start feeling uncomfortable if people ask more than “where is ur dad?” It’s pretty amazing how chill he answered those questions cuz I’d prbly be flustered and stutter a lot lol. Could relate to kris so much cuz pretty much ye obv as a kid u do get jealous of others but then again u don’t even know what it feels like to have a dad so that’s how u get use to it lol.
Prischa I. Rosthanty	You're so great, I'll always love you and waiting every your comeback. 😚
Dia Sultana	What kind of person talks about someone's father or family like that in an interview about his career????????????????
Chanbaek Lover	I'm crying right now😭 if you wouldn't be in the GROUP EXO I would really not gonna support you, because I don't know you. I feel happy that I met EXO and dig all their past happenings and familliarize all of thee member's names and just searching and tryna find out why most of the EXO-M  members are leaving and even Kris is already not a member in EXO  anymore or should I say he is already a former member of EXO every moments that they spend together with all of the members I treasure that so he should too. Like, most of Kris' fans are EXOLs😂 we know Kris becausw of EXO😊 I feel happy for Kris. The interviewer really went to much in his private life HAHAHHA, but I think it is better for us to know what really is his journey and we know that even years has pass by, he didn't forget where he started😊 LIKE WHAT HE SAYS, HE DO TREASURES ALL THE MEMORIES BECAUSE HE WOULD'T REACH HIS DREAMS WITHOUT THEM (members) Kris, We love you and we will respect you like what we always do👌😊 we will continue to support you until the end😊
ttu tu ttu tu	Yes some of the questions were a little too personal but admit it there's this tiny little voice in your head wanting to know the answers to these questions. Kudos to kris for being mature and a good sport. #ot12 😶
Vivian P	i’m not a fan of him as an interviewer. he has one tone with everyone he interviews and kris seems really awkward because of him
Lara Army	I like hearing his voice
BEL	FEEL PROUD OF MAMA WU

王金星	一路勇敢，step by step ,
shoucandy	OMG I USED TO NOT LIKE HIM ANYMORE WHEN HE HAD THE BALD HEAD STYLE BUT OMG NOW HE HAS HAIR AGAIN????💗💗😭😭😭
latifah nuramadhani	"I treasure every moment without that i would never be able to be who i am today so just part of my life" - Kris Wu
Star Buckssme	I can relate to kris. I also never knew my real father or got a chance to see him even in picture. My family never talks about him, i dont even know where my mom meet him. Whenever someone asks me about my father i got really sensitive and awkward because i dont know how will i answer them. The interviewer kept asking him about his dad and kris is so uncomfortable. I can feel what kris feels in this. Such a professional for keeping with the interview
Ika Banjarnahor	Berpisah mudahhhh... tak ada kamu dihidup ku aku mampu... tapi percayalah... menghapus kenangan kita.. adalah hal paling menyulit kan untukku.... Bener ga sih? Bodo ahhh Pengen nyanyi ajaaa
Aly Loayon	why do i feel uncomfortable for him when they were talking about his dad? i mean, its kinda sensitive but he handled it so well
Ahripreety Nongmaithem	Love you yifan da ❤️. ..always be the most gentle n cool guy
Catriona Jay Villarin	Kris😭😭
Jay Zel Kim	I love you kris! We miss you a lot especially EXO😢😍😍😍
Ahmad Rifaldi	i wonder, is kris father know that his son become an artist like now
chaerunnisa rezky	I mean..ur question wow..................Kris u answer it really nice! we miss youuu!!!:(:(
woof baek	Smh the interviewer really didn’t have to ask so much about his dad, he clearly seemed uncomfortable
kir	damn that was super invasive to keep pressing about his dad...... he handled it very well but other people might not. it’s shitty tbh.
F 5	This is the worst Presented i have ever seen
Nadia I. Nitol	The fuck is wrong with this interviewer!?? You asked him once and he gave you an answer, FUCK THE MOVE ON. Instead of focusing on his current achievements, he kept digging at something completely unnecessary. How do these people even get jobs? Mindblown!
Putri Nur Azizah	Don't you thing it's a little bit annoying ? but yeah congratulation kris answered it gently for you.
riz	Dude, at least do some research! Isn't that like the basic of an interviewer?!
yeahitz lmao	I think the questions about his dad were quite unnecessary, he was obviously uncomfortable answering them .
Bích Jiniee	Love you, Kris 💓🔥
Pear Nitcha	Disgusting questions
JigglyChocolateman	I hate when interviewers push really personal questions. We get it, it's interesting, but shit man its his business. Leave him alone about it.
Dhanin Realiza	i feel like crying 😭😭😭😭 that moment when he corrected him about ot12😭😭
kaychun515	it's pretty rude to ask these family questions actually
melody ladio	he is my first bias in EXO and even hes not in EXO now i still support him coz he just do what makes him happy and thats what matters the most..
Nɪɢʜᴛɪɴɢᴀʟᴇ	This interview is very awkward... He did the same thing to Jay Park, but they were very nice
Another pinocchio	*Why would you repeatedly ask him about his Dad!? He looked uncomfortable.*
SONA THOMAS	Awkward personal questions!
Sivya EXOL	don't blame him for leaving EXO, everypne even me my ownself would do the same for what i like and my own freedom
youngin	if he really didn't wanna talk about his father, then he could've told vlad to switch up and find something else to talk about. it ain't the interviewers fault, even though vlad is a fucking fool with his questions sometimes
Ngan Nguyen	please just stop mentioning exo
selene Morreth	Why is he digging into his privacy much like tens question about his dad. He declared once and that's enough. That's bad and awkward. Yikes.
Edith balicwey	kris wu,I wish that someday you will return in EXO team performing together.
nazaiya	Oh my god, why is the MC's questions so insensitive? It's hard to even open up like that even with people you're close with but this? And it's a bit awkward too, like the MC doesn't respond back to Kris well (or he sounds like he wants to proceed to the next question asap). Anyway, Kris is amazing and he has worked so hard. So proud. 💕✨
Aeris Sy	Kris and I have a almost same situation about Family He grow up without a Father nad never meet him while Me I grow up without a Parents (but I Meet them) they have already their own family It just make me sad bcoz how come they can be happy meanwhile me and my big sister grow up without them especially my Mom. My Mom live far away from us and my Dad same place with us but need to take a long ride (lol) still Kris you're still lucky bcoz you have your Mom
tisxx xx	Milla Jovovich walked away when interviewer asked bout her dad. She just slammed the glass in front of her and go. this is rude when people dont want to talk bout personal thing but u keep pushing him..
xixi miss	What doesn’t kill him makes him stronger. Be a fair audience before you talk.
Carissa Francis	Omg....the interviewer is just like unneccesarily asking him super insensitive stupud questions about him and his dad.....
Keila Cabrera	We love you and support you kris
nobi dolo	My heart melts😭
moore XBJ	Looking forward to the new album .My fanfan💋💋💋
張雲翔	These questions are disrespect to him , Kris you are the good singer so keep going hope you have a wonderful day.
Krizzia Agripa	AyO wAsSupppppp?       Never forget.
nobodylikes mycomments	"12 members in total" 😢   " i was a rapper in the group"  For some years I've been ignoring his feelings and sort of hated him for leaving but now I feel sad watching this, it must have been hard. Fighting Kris! I hope an ot12 reunion happens.
kim fxnrxh	The interviewer should at least do a background check on him before he starts to interview and I really dislike his way of questioning and it's so unprofessional. Kris is a nice sweet guy and he deserve a better treatment.
Swen Li	love Kris❤️
Skyblue Icecream	his 'me and my dad?' is rlly cute and reminds me of his cute side
shbis	why is he prying on his private life like this, its insensitive and unprofessional. please talk about his album and his upcoming projects instead.
tiara amanda	I am also curious abt kris wu family..  But this is rude..  Leave him alone
Chanyeols muscles got that POWER	Sorry interviewer guy.. but the fuck was it necessary to ask that many dad questions? And you ended up with EXO.. wow.. i'm just amazed how dumb a interview can be!?!? XD Stop digging in the past and promote their current carrier, music and stuff!
케이트EXO-L 1485	My OT12 heart ♥ is 😢 😣 We miss you Kris 😣😭😭
Infinity Alexx	3:00 damn. He just explained my life lol. But it wasn’t divorce since my mother and father weren’t married. And I didn’t move. Oof

INANG CHEN CHEN 94_21	We love you kris💕You we know and a sad truth that you left at exo but we will still your fans,we still love you and support you tho🖒💕
Madalina Maria	My parents are divorced ever since  I was 2 years old and my mom raised me and my sister alone. That interviewer is kinda annoying. I'm saying this because I know what those stupid questions can make one feel like. He's asking too much. You should've stopped when he said they are divorced, because he obviously wasn't comfortable anymore. Disrespectful.
the statue jin kissed in blood sweat and tears	*YEEH*
zhuzhengting is goddamn bottom	I swear to my religion, this interview is damn disrespectful. If i was kris, i dont know how long can i calm for these question about his dad. It was a bad memories and he never want to talk about it again and the interviewer just asking about it.
Chika Laurentia	yeahhhhhhh yeahhhhhhh -kris wu
라온Ra On	I love this boy so damn much! He is amazing, like really, look how he kept his smile on his face even though those questions were a bit uncomfortable! Kris is so strong and he deserves everything he has today and even more! I am glad to be able to support such a great man! My boy Kris, my Galaxy, my Yifan, I am so proud of you and I'll support you no matter what! Good luck! I love you ♡
Andrei Marie Habuyo	when kris leave exo i felt bad but i think you just follow your heart and exo-l will just support you always
Amber Lee	Interviewer is really dumb ass!
idazzling fangurl	just when he talks about exo, my heart ache. Someone call the doctor pls
昳澄	哥哥加油。每个你都在
Aphrodite Angel	Yeah😑 I don't like you questioning Kris about his father it's kinda awkward duhhh
sara naza	"That time it was big"☕☕☕☕☕☕☕🍻🍻😁😁
Kayleigh Soriano	*LISTEN TO HIS VOICE WITH HEADPHONES*    Fuck its an asmr *bitch*
Mr. Pepper Roni	Guys, dont speak for him. Ofcourse it wasnt on the spot interview. It was pitched in to him prior. Thats how it works.
Yohana Mian	tf...
no one xiv	I don't know but shouldn't the interview focus on his music not on his personal matters?
ONCE isenough 4 TWICE	Wtf why need to ask about his dad that much 😭 and hearing him talk about exo... My ot12 💔
Yazmeen Villanueva	Why the pressuring questions about his father??? He stated in the beginning that his parents were divorced when he was little... why should it matter??? why would he want to rekindle soemthing that never was?? I really dislike this interviewer
BTS JON KOK LOVE	love kai xiumin Soho
pcy park	my strong man❤ wish you always happy kriswu ❤❤
Della Mái	Why Kris gets asked more about Exo than Tao & Luhan. Because every time I look up kris it’s always someone bringing up exo and mind you they went from bros to now strangers but when I look up Luhan & Tao it’s rarely anything about talking about exo. Why is it only haunting kris?  (Low key I started listening to exo a few months ago Because I found out he was a Scorpio and his birthday 3 days after mines just to find out he left 😭)
Elin Li	心疼吴亦凡
lucky surya	I guess it's not only me who uncomfortable with the headline and the questions, but for the most, I'm happy for you Kris, seriously, all the hard times you've been through took you to another level, which is good... I'm glad you life comfortable now, and how much I adore you to answer those questions... Stay healthy, Kris💚💚💚
Yan Yannie	😭😭😭😭
Qtzi U	Actually I like that he talked about his mom. My favorite aunt. Was more of a mother than my mother raised her son without his father . He’s now a marketing trainer.   He is a strong resilient man because of his mom. I think it’s sweet.
spp nbv	the interviewer is a bit awkward
shannen ericka	50% English 50% YEAH 😚😂
Lu	well... this was awkward 💀 anyway, love u kris wu !! THAT ALBUM DROPPING NOVEMBER 2nd!!!
Kai Kim	Kris hyuuuuuuungggg!! 😭😭😭
mikasa akemii	Man stop askin bout his dad!! It hurts u know! Just stop! He's smiling that doesn't mean he's  comfortable!
Bumi LT	Exactly when exo is being brought up, Kris smile disappeared 😅
Want to watch P0RN? Search EXO - KOKOBOP on youtube	He's so polite.
Beep Beep Imma Dragon	I love how his sunglasses coordinate with his shirt complimentary colors work so well when done right 😎
10 piece mcnuggets	oh my god you can’t just ask people what happened to their father if they weren’t present in their life jesus. the first portion of the interview was far too prying. at least ask the initial where’s your dad but damn he really went in. very very disrespectful
罗芷	❤️❤️❤️
Marsaline 7	Oh boy☺️
王烁	nice boy
Smile Bright	He's doing so well, so proud ☺
Regular Huh	CHANGE THE TİTLE RN , please
Brittany Blessed	This is America you guys are mad about the deep questions but you know nothing about this mans channel he always ask deep questions and some are uncomfortable this isn’t kpop or even China American interviews are super open and deep so kris or anyone else should do research about the show they are going on before accepting to come. If y’all want baby questions and elementary answers then don’t watch this channel or Wendy Williams or the breakfast club or basically any American show.
kuroraini	these questions are getting a bit too personal;;
Long Sotheary	Oppa😘😘😘 fighting!!! U are always shine bright in this universe coz just not a star u are the galaxy!!!
Ant-Man	What's up with the daddy questions? .-.
Tori L	Hes not a kpop idol anymore. He was already aware of the questions beforehand otherwise he wouldve stated he was uncomfortable. If Kris was okay with it, we should be. This interview is pretty tame & composed compared to a lot of american interviews. Yall needa chill.
Oop Ireallywannacry	Man is it bad I cried during this whole interview? I love kris so much it hurt so bad when he left exo but to see him flourish and be happy makes me happy I’ll always support the boys who left I love them so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Khadijah H	omfg why do you keep asking about his dad?? he clearly DOES NOT want to talk about it or have nothing to say about it
Huiphoria ‘	I understand you guys don’t like how the man was asking him questions, but you guys also have to understand that this is how he asks questions to every guest he has and more than likely kris and his management know this. They must have agreed to what is okay to ask prior to doing the interview, because that’s how these work. Just chill, he’s a grown man and can make his own decisions.
tacky and fabulous	Lmao when he said exo was big at that time. Is he saying they aren’t big anymore 😬
EYA_EXO-L	I love u kris 😙😍
Shinxran9111	This interviewer rly annoyed me omg. Talk about insensitive smh. half the video was like about his father that he DOESNT want to talk about and making him uncomfortable. ughhhhh what an embarrassment. That guy better be switched with a new guy. So terrible. Kris is so strong and patient- I would’ve just told him to shut up and not to about his father
Rameena Sahibzada	Is this interviewer dumb as fuck? He needs to stop asking sensitive questions.
Officer A	This feels wrong man. It feels like watching someone force someone to be naked. It feels wrongggg. Soooooooimout
lee taemin	ot12 forever
Marianna K	I don't know why all these questions about his father tho?
Giselle Ontuca	Whatever you want to do as long as you are happy and it is good for you, lots of EXOLs will support you.
sea	i love kris!!!  but whenever you interview someone associated with the kpop industry you are so invasive! it's not cute
jackeline vargas mendoza	♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
우유배토	I gotta admit those questions were too personal
Sky Up In The Sky	EXOTIC HERE
Britt	"This company in Korea."
sangpuii kholhring	Stupid interviewer!! How can you keep on asking about his dad when he's so uncomfortable,u should know that even from the starting,asking once is okay but why forcing him to reveal so much...he's a celebrity and u must respect his privacy Dumbest interviewer i've ever seen😡😣😤
Slam funk	chong chingn chang ? phong tong pang?
S Lee	With a loving and caring mom, Kris has grown into a great fine man, and a very talented artist.  Looking forward to Kris’ new album “Antares” coming out on this Friday.  Music does not have any borders.  It is a beautiful thing when good music is heard and appreciated by a lot of people around the world.
coolkies21	‘they were big at that time yeah’         2018: they are still huge....  i miss OT12 days TT
Donnamark yang	We know kris miss the Exo members... they was close and good friends.. I hope they can meet each other again..
Aissa Nadjiam	I had to skip the Dad topic, love him lots
Carly Raimey	I felt so tense watching him answer the family questions, but I also think some people are taking this out of proportion. At any moment he could have said, let's talk about something else. Also important to remember these are questions NOBODY asks him in detail, so there must be a reason DJ Vlad was asking them in order to give fans answers... judging by his expressions and responses it potentially was uncomfortable for him, but Kris is a grown man and can handle a some pressure. We dont need to treat him like a baby, he isn't one. Overall good interview, thanks for the upload.
diana casados	Very humble, I love and will always support you Kris💜💜
Swey Wayne	Wtf is wrong with the questions?? Why does he keep asking him about his dad??
chenles screeching is my national anthem	Kris has such a good personality  I'm glad he got out of SM and succeed ❤  (no hate on Exo i love them just SM doesn't treat there idols right which is honestly painful to see  and if you don't belive me look up Ncts mangers treating them wrong )
Army Blinks	I love him even more now.
Jade 2muchSauce	I love Kris with my whole heart but those hair are hella terrible, please baby change them and start to shine again ❤️❤️❤️
KY0627 KY0061	I love you
starving cat	Even if the riporter asked stupid and unrespectful questions he smiled so brightly all along. I love him so much, i can't even express how much.:(
Ruatpuii_Rp Rp	Talking about exo😭😭😭
KhadijatheproudEXO-L stan weirdos	looks like a talk show for private life,  is it really like this?  -I'm thankful to this video, bcoz of this I love Kris even more cause I know he's still cherish the memories he had with exo but what got me is the questions is like a shark in a small fishpond😱😱😨
Francis Ann Amor	It was quite disappointing that the host put too much attention about Kris' father and how he didn't get the sense of changing the topic. It makes me sad in Kris' part though, and he is obviously not comfortable about that.
Samruddhi Gudhe	The interviewer is doing such a bad job It's a miracle that Kris was being so patient n understanding with him
Murky_doll without_heart	I dont know my father too. My parents divorced when I was 1.5 year old. Then he dissapear. Kris you are  strong! And wonderful person with bright smile. And extremely dark hot aura.
xaxa	i just wanna hug him because this seems more like a fiery interrogation rather than an interview. like dude can you try to be a little less insensitive and in his face about it.
Khun OC	VLAD WTF MAN HOW MANY GODDAM QUESTIONS U GON ASK MY MANS KRIS WU REGARDING HIS FATHER? U RLLY TRYNA MILK DAT DAMN SMH
Ester Margolis	You can tell by the way he talks about exo it still hurts him what happend with sm
BLOSSOM LARRY MUEMA	Am sure Kris approved this questions ...it happens before interviews people 😭
Mariya EXOL	I don’t know how kris felt but I’m fucking feeling uncomfortable right now watching this
Astro Bear	Yeah...i don't think that the questions were very well planned. Maybe asking briefly about his family but if he says that he grew up with his mom, then maybe asking about her, why ask about someone that is not even relevant to his career and life? I understand that people want to know about their past but it even seemed a little bit rude, idk.
O.P.1090	that was awkward
Anna Lewis	this interviewer was kinda nosy lol but it was really nice to get to know a bit more about kris!!!!
Naw Ra	I miss my chicken is not my style guy kris wu
DaReoCharmer	He was pretty good in xXx
Juliana Reiterer	Although i‘m not an EXO-l since OT12 Time, I really do miss him with the members. But we can’t change the past! EXO-L will ALWAYS Love and Support you! You have a big Fandom behind you! ❤️
The Dragon	Not having your Dad beside you from childhood is quite painful. Though he's hurt , he did't show up during this Interview. I mean wao.
super sa	The interviewer is really rude. I bet he wouldnt be like that to a white celebrity. You dont have rights to dig into his personal family life like that.
sofia	love this guy❤️
Elina Mareta	I am proud of you Kris.
Alya DIABIRA	i liked kris wu since exo he's amazing
fraai	interesting guest ;) nice
swimablecorn	This Buffalo rolled far and I'm proud.

Jearean Mae Mayan	When will Legend of Ravaging Dynasty 2 will be finished? Lol
sarah Hamoudi	You did well kris
nctwangjaenim	Geez!! Did you really have to ask him the detail about his Dad? He already answered that he basically doesn't know that much about his Dad, wasn't that enough? The questions were all kinda disrespectful about that
yehet	i love his “yeah”
goku son	I wanted to know more about kris wu than his relationship with his father...weird interview
Arum Dayama Praniti	I love him  just the way he is 😍
Lola Philippi	He was so freaking nervous while talking about EXO
Sueaz Libe	Stan SF9! https://youtu.be/rQ8MFfg3DHA
park chanyeol will you marry me	wow he really need to wait for EXO to comeback to do this interview :))))) good job man
jie lin	Kris Wu,fighting!
Yifan Wu	I think it’s sooooooooo rude to ask about others private life🙄🙄
pcys black hoodie	I can't help but feel bad for him.. semms like he still can't talk about those sensitve topics  fully comfortably.. Vlad also seemed a bit insensitive with his questions but Kris stayed humble and respectful.. people need to stop bringing Exo in every damn interview he makes, I'm an Exol myself and that shit is annoying tf out of me ooff move on
Elle Zee	Wow awkward! Why is the interviewer probing into such personal matters? That's kind of rude. I bet Kris was really uncomfortable. That's the kind of conversation you have with people you are close to.
Diana K	His smile 😍
Elisha Gift Gomez	Now i understand why. I still love you b. I just wish you could have stayed longer but i respect your decision. I wish everyone is given a freedom to choose what they love. Change your ways Kpop industries! You might lose really good artist because of this types of issues.
Let Me Be ViVi	Kris and his dad = me and my dad
ILove JHope!!!	My god this interview was so awkward and cringy. Why such personal questions about his dad? It's no one's business.
Sarang BTS	There’s no privacy for his life all of them was like how did u start when did u join exo after u left what did u do where did u go like what I thought he was going to ask abt music and his album etc
Zen Espinoza	wow. just woooww
Nadz Amilasan	the interviewer was so brave. it requires a lot of courage man.
Hareem Bostan	The interviewer is kind of rude to Kris. He shouldn't be talking about someone's father like that
Sehun's Rainbow Hair	When I saw that he was going to talk about EXO I felt really happy because he will always remember his team
elle	Kris WUUUUUUUUUUU
teenpm838	Finally kris is talking about Exo he always avoided questions about it
dhewi casso	So sad to hear about his father. I always curious about his dad. It's like what i think, i always think is his dad and mom divorce? Bcs he never said about his dad. But now, we know the real story. 😭😭
lh7 trash	Damn this interviewer is so brave. Wow
Chung Hoàng	Love you like that!
Kathleng Tuleleng	ot12 feels~
Thammy Vo	Interviewer would benefit from interviewing course. Never seen Kris so uncomfortable. It goes to show doesn't matter how sucessful one becomes all grown up, their childhood can still affect them deeply.
刘美俐	okay but the questions about his father were waaay too personal and really unnecassary ..
Luhan's Han	I love him. That's it.  Anyway, I skipped the interview about his dad bcs you know, if the interviewer doesn't know this, I still respect the word PRIVACY😏.   Ah, but his laugh at 6:02😭 That hehe😂😍.  *P.S: Pre-order his new album now! It's called Antares!*
Max Jia	why is he always tied with exo, especially interviews in America,like every single one😕
Flames	I hated to see Kris so uncomfortable while the interviewer keeps asking about his dad.
ellis	he obviously isn't comfortable talking about his dad, why would you ask him so much💀
Duyun Dong	Kris always looks on the good side of everything, I guess that’s why he can gain power from the past and keep moving forward all the time. Really   respect you!!! I wish all the best to you!
Infires Taekook	Handsome face and great personality.
Mango Touray	Kris was an exo member
luna	The family questions were a bit too much
Sonia Maria Nistor	He really knew how to answer these questions diplomatically, but some of this dumbass questions are ridiculous, I’d probably loose my shit if i was him, but no, Kris Wu is Kris Wu 💪💪💪
Ryan Holland	This was the worst interview ever smh it was obvious that he didn’t want to keep talking about his father but yet it kept being brought up. The questions were awful smh
Daisy Liu	Obviously he has an good mother and has a deep influence on him. I really like him, music, especially lullaby.
Zaldy. S334	knpa bicarain ayah nya sih anjirr
zkdlin Kai	Atleast,  he still treasure his experience in EXO.  I will support him no matter what 😍😍
CasaKPOP	I definitely love that Kris is being known not only in the Chinese music market. I am so proud of him! I love that he is collaborating with artists like Jhene Aiko. His music is so awesome! I love how he is bringing American music/hip hop and Asia together. I've been a fan of his since he was in EXO and even when he started his solo career.
Xiumin	Miss OT12 😣😣
Rhea June Mabaylan	I wish you all the best Kris ge. Thank you for everything and goodluck with your new album. I look forward to it. Can't wait to listen to you. Do it your style,  take care always.
GOLDEN -L	WOW OUR BOY IS ALL GROWN UO...GOOD ENGLISH THERE
Army Till The End Of Time	this is the most awkward interview i've ever seen in my life and i'm very sorry it happened to kris , a lot of couples get divorce, a lot of children grow up not knowing their dads or moms, so why do you seem so surprised, why do you keep asking questions abt it, even a blind person can tell he didn't wanna keep talking abt it, and it was pretty disrespectful, and for the record 6'1 is considered tall everywhere not just in asia....sorry but you're a bad interviewer
fah sai	❤️❤️❤️
t m	Wow those were some great questions.
Josephine Deng	Very good interview actually
nour chaker	The questions seem to not really respect his privacy . It's not good to ask peaple questions like that.
VALENTINEB0Y	Yall got no respect for privacy
dancing star	Anyway,i love u,kris😚
Tracey Hayes	3 minutes of him asking about his father is not cool...anyways, Kris good luck with your new album
tell me what is bias	support Kris on his Antares Album it'll release on November 2 and its going to be a bop!
TaeTen Jaeno	Kris Wu Director, producer, Singer-Songwriter and Actor. Active in China
Rara Azura	Please make Kris speaking Korean again! :(
Holdup	Vlad not everyone grows up with two parents lol he act so surprised
Kpop Oppa Sehun	ارجع كريس مشتاقيلك ارجوووك exo. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😨😭😭😭😭
Thanh Lam Lê	I hate how the interviewer didn’t do any real research on Kris Wu and EXO before interviewing him, like, you might not know who he is but Kris Wu is a big name, same goes for EXO. The whole interview came off as super unprofessional for me, especially since the interviewer went into some really personal stuff and say things like “asian parents and russian parents are kinda similar” - i wouldn’t imagine otherwise since if you’re talking about asia, that includes russia as well...Kris handled the whole interview really well, he was chill yet strong the whole time and I respect him for that. Good on you Kris!
xiuamy	excited for kris's new album antares!💗💗

Gum Bee	The interviewer was so fucking annoying..
Sangita Shrestha	0:57 emotional Kris
Kjsmoov	the interviewer is fuckin awful.
Fata Rehn	Now we know FOR SURE that he keeps his memories with EXO as a treasure. He appreciate his moments with EXO. In my opinion, Yifan think that this is the perfect time to him to say what he really felt about him as an EXO member without create any scandal. So, whoever who called him as traitor please stop it. He has reasons okay, he want to develop his talents and style. And also, for his family too. Lets support him! ❤❤
Valery Kos	Wow, the questions about his father were completely inappropriate.
feary chen	he is so cute
Lira Bermas	WOW.OMG KRIS. OT12.EXO.E X O. YOUR BROS
陈敏	he is a cool boy
Brittany L	Kris is so humble and laid back 😍😎
Chennie kim	Kris album will release in Nov 2 the same day of EXO's comeback... :)
dir-exo-ner	the title really pisses me off.we can all see how awkward kris got while asked about his father. you can clearly see that he was somewhat upset talking about it even though he was smiling. like can they not understand that this is a very sensitive topic ? it's so fucking insensitive to ask someone something like that. i got so sad,i love yifan with my soul and it bothers me to see ppl be so insensitive towards him and get all nosy about his personal life -_-
Minjinsor Ganbaatar	Glad he is doing well and do what he wanted. Go galaxy prince🙌🙌🙌💪💪💪😍😍😍😍 I will always be your true fan 💕💕💕
sungieluv	Idono how this got on my feed but I kno who Kris is and his hardships in Korea. But this is definitely the most prying interview he has done. He's so famous and well known. This interview is way too personal. Kris is alwsys very professional and with his fluency in English he can totally get thru it without being awkward but dang. Interviewing a top star like this is kinda weird. Like if ur a new fan of him wanting to learn more Idono if ppl wanna hear him have to focus on his parents divorce and how he grew up not knowing his dad and all that. I mean people who kno him both fans and just others respect his privacy of him not talking about his personal life like this. This is a really rare thing for him to broadcast this in this way
Cypress Lee Dulmigas	I’m worried cause I can see that he’s kinda nervous answering the questions about being an exo member buuuttt I’m proud of you fanfan of what you’re in now! I miss that lips 😂
Baekhyunee Exo	6:13 I'M CRYIIING MY OT12 HEART 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Iris Lou	woah... this is so wierd... kris wu used to be my good friends god brother..

Happiness Delight	Wu na I'm From China so. ❤ I Love You Always. My Kris Wu.!!
Nouchee Lor	Haha I love how Chil Kris is <3
amanda x	He is tough enough for such mean topic. I respect that.
Nicole Magallanes	Kris Wu, my bias in EXO😔💕
pencil 0126	why ask too much about the absent father? it made me uncomfortable so kris must have felt bad. what the heck..
DONT MESS UP MY TEMPO	Exo-l love you kris..you always part of our big family. We will support you and other too..always be happy and keep smile ok...we love u kris...always remember that we are one ok❤💕😉
Suho is Love	He's right

Dino Chen	You're the best, my baby Kris ❤❤❤❤❤❤ I ❤ U sooooo much!!!! I'm so proud of you 💝💝
haha t	hh
Lilly C	Talking with my Chinese housemate who's in UK for the first time Me: -mentioned Kris Wu- Her: Ohhh he's very famous! Me: yeah isn't he from Exo? Her: Exo who? I don't know them but Kris is very famous Damn :D
BamJIN GotBangtan	That deep voice ,KRIS 😊♥️ miss him. 😭😭 GALAXY..we love you Galaxy Fanfan ,fighting!
ColaKeiYing	The interview dude is so unprofessional n retarded. What’s with his dumb questions
Mary Cepeda	5:36 Kris Wu explains NCT
ลู่หาน เป็นเมียเซฮุน	คือไม่ควรถามพี่คริสแบบนี้นะ ไร้มารยาท
วัชราวลี นกทอง	The question from mc is not good.why ask like that. It's enough he have a goood mom!!  Love Kris wu so much. Kris wu is the best.
Aye Chanmoe	The interviewer should respect Kris's privacy. As a fan, I like Kris, love his songs and movies but don't want to know seriously about his family . I hate that interviewer 😈😠
Aaliyah Nicole Padilla	💗
Dian Puspita Dewi	Why he keep asking about his father??? Obviously, he did not want to talk about that..
andres luo	Quien puede subir español ？
Cathy huang	I kind of share the same background.Mom and Dad divorced when I was 5 year old.Sure it has big influence on my rest of life.I feel sad about Kris.He never like to introduce this topic.His father must have really hurt his feeling.
Bae Ssi	He said ..he treasure every moment and without that he will be not where he is today..
Brandon Lee’s crazy vids	The interviewer making me feel uncomfortable man.. imagine the silence in real life if i feel this awkward through videos..
Kpop Maexo	We treasure you too❤
jitlogs Jitlogs	why would he go there? that was a touchy subject
Sage	*EXO-L's WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU* 💓
Moïrane dance	Honestly too much questions about his father...i can feel that he was uncomfortable about this topic and rather than talk about his family situation I think it would be better to talk about these projects in details and these dreams  (just my opinion 🙂)
Jessica Nguyen 阮希	Kris is my idol and I will support him in whatever he does. He has worked hard ever since he was a trainee. He trained four years to be with Exo and now has left to do his own music!!!! I myself am part chinese and can totally understand his situation after leaving Exo, SM Ent, and Korea. So let’s all give him lots of love and support and buy his album!!!  Btw I really don’t like the title of this video. I feel like their using it just to get views. Also it must have been quite difficult for him to answer questions about his past with Exo because there’s prob a lot of information he can’t mention and also very awkward to him
giovanni dinda	6:09 exo
rykrae	This interview is so fuckin... nosy?? Feels more like a paparazzi stunt than an actual fucking interview
Sweetbaozi_99 Kim	We miss you Kris😢always remember that no matter what,EXO-L's are always here to support you.For us you will always be our EXO-M Leader😉LOVE YOU💋
Zackie J	He's not supposed to ask his personal life bcause it's a pain one 🙄
YOMOMOMAMA	Vlad you  a bitch trynna always dig up dirt from people fuck u !
mary rose barrientos	i really miss kris wu
Huy	mái tóc bựa vcc
H. L	Antares coming soon Nov.2 Stay tuned plz!
Mike Sheridan	It's crazy that Vlad doesn't have the same reaction when a black dude says he don't know his father 😁🤔
Starry Jewel	💕💕💕
choco mint	we been knowing his "dad" was never around.. notice how he turns the questions about his mom. ;_;
Sandy He	dude you spent 40% of this clip asking about his father when he already told you he was never there....what does that have to do with him making music and breaking into the hiphop scene?!?!?!?!? i just don't get it...can you chill out and start asking relevant questions like do better research!
claras	woah these are some real personal questions
Aishwarya Shah	asking about dad and piling up questions about his dad is too much , thats stupid !the questions were so stupid like there is thing called privacy dude
Obey The Sun	So now yall bringin kpop weirdos here smh vlad I would smaick the shit outta of you
the technicstechnishion	Have no clue who he is
imane Exol	KRIS I MISS UU  OT12 FOREVER
Nam Kook Bang	I lost count on how many times Kris said “ya’ know” but yeah he really improved and im happy that he’s comfortable to talk about his past ❤️ gonna wait for his album!!
Chim da Mochi	Interviewer: 'So what's the last time you guys actually talked?' Kris in his head: 'Yeah, well I guess the time I had this really deep conversation about life and stuff when I was about 0.2 years old, yeah'
Bahar Ramadani	What a sweet gentle soul.
Lordpraisethe	WOOOOOOAH
Lenna h	Oh my god why the fuck did they focus so much on the dad it's like a fourth of the video leave it alone dude
MRH 92	My EXO😭😭 MY OT12😭😭
Lalá	all my love and respect for him ❤
disney chanyeor	WAIT KRIS WU KNOWS JAY PARK ??? HIT US UP WITH A SONG PLEASE ????????
XIV Gothica	my boy was attacked with personal questions but he did well
Majesticool Muffin	The MC asking the questions is TERRIBLE. "ok. ok. ok. ok. dad? dad. your dad? ok. dad???. ok" stop asking about his dad, that's such a personal and awkward topic. MC made this interview so awkward like what the heck. Kris deserves more respect than what was given here. This is stuff Kris can talk about with his friends if he wants but prying personal information out in this interview ://///
Shine On Em	Tough one
Purejoy Ogunbiyi	This interviewer is asking kris the most rubbish questions ngl. I just want him happy 💖💖
Seeking Knowledge	*Rude interviewer.*
Vera Grassi	Сделайте рус. суб.
Tessa Jade	Why does this feel like an interview for casting porn 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
Sasha Feria	4:00 to 4:07 BIG ASS MOOD LMFAOOOOO
oh eunwoo!	4:39 is where he starts talking about the sm audtition and exo :))
Altaire Versailles	Vlad's clickbait he chose for you to get you to watch this was "Kris Wu on never knowing his father." If you simple minded ass dummies dont realize Vlad is making fools out of you niggas daily I dont know what to tell you.
Baekhyun's Girl	That interviewer is such a disgusting person. Doesn't he have some emotions or something? Instead of talking about his career, or music he asked him about his father and past issues.
sara C	These questions were invasive...Kris handled it all well tho. But I hope people wouldn’t ask him such private questions. Everyone who likes kris, misses him, or is his fan please check out ANTARES! It’s dropping on Nov 2nd! Finally he’s having an album, and you already know it’s gonna be LIT
23slickid23	this nigga look like a pop start from the 80's with this glasses and haircut lol
Kylen Casteel	Honestly I don't know Kris very well. I just know that he's an amazing artist who has been though enough shit for an entire lifetime. I hope he keeps doing what he loves for a very long time.
Nol123 Maisnam	Stay strong my king... 👍👍
ghrqueen	Those times are really beautiful, a very beautiful memory. Thank you for all the smiles laughs and tears, thank you for all the beautiful moments. I'm not a fan of you now, but I hope you're doing well ☺
Harshita Das	We love you Kris Exols always by your side!!!! 😭😭😭💖💖💖💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
DΞΔN	0:58 1:25 1:34 2:40  I don't think you can just ask that, that's rude!!
Victoria Sánchez.	Ugh, you can clearly say he felt uncomfortable.  But he managed to stay calm in some way.  I love how he was so respectful and thoughtful of what he said.  Keep going, I hope you always do well!
Farah Nabila	The interviewer asked him about his dad. When he said that he never met his dad, you should stop asking more about it. It looks too awkward for me. And Kris doesn't looks like he like it
Regi Wu	I'm a 6years Kris Wu yifan fan and it's my first time hearing him talking about his family life on public.  👏👏👏👏 he changed a lot,  wow  good luck Kris, I'm so proud of you 💟💙💜❤💛 #Antares 11.02
namita singha	Man those questions abt his dad just broke me n kris answering it with a smile.
Vondy Adicta	I'm so proud of Kris, and his first album antares. I can't wait.
maria lee	this was kinda disrespectful, i mean exo AND his father. why did he have to bring up the past, especially his family, it’s rlly important and private to him i guess. his mom is an amazing woman.
Tee 357	I'm assuming he never does movies in America, because I never heard of him.🤷🏿‍♂️
sammy	y was he so adamant on talking about his dad tho
kris's style not chicken	That interviewer made me angry like why u keep asking him about his dad
#마리	This is the most awkward interview ever especially the start, what kind of question are those?
Oro The Nymph	Good luck, Kris. (dear inverviewer, y'might want to work on your interview style, which comes across as incredibly disrespectful)
Noelle	Proud of you Kris, it must be hard to talk about all of this but I am glad you got to this point
Nancy Lei	I swear to God these interview questions are making me so hella uncomfortable... Like why force somebody to talk about his father if you can tell that he doesn't want to? Like dude are you blind or just plain ignorant? This is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional behavior.
Maral Imanalieva	❤
Ice Joy	When will the part2 be  out?
ELLE SANTOS	Thats our boy right there!  But how come all the topics are pretty much sensitive one about his uncontacted father (like wth man! thats a pretty awkward question), leaving exo (deym x10)  Anyway we will always support you whatever you do Kris! getting through it all the harships, thats our Wu yifan! go get it mah boi!
Magneto Kwa	Who the hell is this
Sanjana Simon	ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS INTERVIEWS😄😢
zkdlinexo _	FIRST OF ALL WHY DOES THIS INTERVIEW MAKE ME TEAR UP. I mean about his dad and all. it wasn't easy but you are doing great Kris. keep it up!!
Charmiley Madamba	Hey'all EXO-L's / eris out there. am i the only one who cried when our galaxy oppa spoke about EXO 😭💖 ot12 feels 💔
Abdalah Pulcra	cool dude
Sevan Almasoud	Exols  are  always with you
Jason Le	Without a father it’s a lot harder for young men to move on to become gentlemen
TheAshMaster1000	kris is so damn ass cool
forKriswu Jang	thx for sharing.expect Kriswu's album. love his music so much!
sinigang na kimchi	galaxy fanfan 💗😭😍
Krystal ypr	l love Kris Wu
Aeri_Tempo_XO	We all know EXO is his back story n it'll be forew BUT stop asking him abt it on every intw, stop making ma boy hurt n uncomfortable 😭 IT'S FOUR YEARS AGO.... COME ON LET'S MOVE ON
That sensitive psychopath	When he says that sad shit about his dad while smiling that shit be breaking my 💓
O.L. Wilson-Marlow	This was a bit left of uncomfortable to listen to.  Still love that Yifan is getting himself out there on his own.
Alex Chen	He was worth everything
SuperCaliFragiListicExpiali DopeShit	😂😂😂😂 This dude looks like that Asian gangster from the movie, King of New York who says, "I ain't no grease ball named Ardie Clay."
Chanbaek's Love	I've missed you so much Kris I'm so proud of you good luck on your career and I got you back big man
WENWONJUNJEON	This interview saddens me but feel so proud about Kris. All along I’ve always been curious about Kris’ family but haven’t been able to do some research about coz there’s really nothing on the internet regarding about it but now, I feel like Kris deserves all he has now after all he went through in life. ❤️ Kris, be healthy and always show that gummy smile to everyone. 😊
Fitria AS	I miss you 'galaxy hyung'
FinalxHearts	Krissss💙💙💙💙💙
jay Davis	Some how... Vlad is softening him up to say he moves bricks of smack
yolanda finza	I MISS YOU😭❤
Vyka Wu	Kris wu is king , u r awesome , no matter what else those haters say , there r huge army behind u and  I am so proud be a part of that army
purpelle	That's too private! Like can you just ask when his career first started or some sort? Why continously ask about his dad?  Love you, Kris! I'm so proud of you!💜
Umi Wakhid	We are so sorry Yifan, honestly after you not a members of EXO I'm verry disappointed of you. But now I understand what you feel. Thanks for everything that you have to do with EXO. I hope you and EXO doing big collaboration. Be successful our Galaxy Fan2. 😭😭😭😭
jian shan	Kris Wu ！So charming and coooool！i love him so much🔥🔥🔥
duan duan	❤️🔥
MsZeeDot	Interviewer seems so disrespectful. His tone that is.
Mancy kk	I'm proud of you！Kris💓
Yohana Zira	😭😭😭
Alice Monko	This is a sensitive subject! He rarely talks about his father. 。
Intan Pasek	Its kinda annoying to hear the interviewer talking serious about his mom and dad being divorce... He even didnt laugh when kris tried to laugh to make the situations not serious... I mean .. Is he blind or something?? Look at kris eyes, he look uncomfortable with all of that questions. How disrespectful!
XIUMIN XIUMIN	Please don't forget us EXO&EXOL🙏
Steven	all the question about his dad his smile went from "BIG to damn man my feelings hurt" lol
Ayu Mutiaa	i love my leader
Alexa Mae Barroca	i'm so happy that he knows that the exo has 12 members. he remember it.. i'm crying.😭 i still want him to be part of exo. my ot12 heart😭😭
PCY Hanbin	huhuhuhu KRIS!!!!
Raven Jihyo	so much maturity in kris! supporting you all the way~
Felicia Felicia	my boy Kriswu ❤️
Evan Sheng	Kris Wu
nguyen ngan	glad that you still remember EXO
Weirdlywired Exol	That is a very insensitive title, I mean we really don't need to sensationalize everything. At least leave people's personal lives out of this! -_-
dyugh	Miss u laxy
Esra Uysal	Why so many serious stuff going on in this interview.. Anyway he's a strong man so even though he went trough hard times, now he is comfortable talking about them. Galaxy is ours. Peace out my meiniggas.
se hun Oh	😞
xiumin toyourworld	I cried.
McKenzie Hart	Great interview! It's nice to get to know the artist as a person and how he got started. I'm looking forward to the seeing the rest of the interview.
suho's belly button	Kris: talks about OT12 *cries in chogiwa language*
yenicall xian	He is a very good boy. I believe he will get what he wants and look forward to his album Antares.
yi欢	🕊🖖 fighting
EXO-L	Im not crying
artemis do	i miss ot12. i'll support you no matter what
Tia Sy	I'm very proud of Kris to see where    he is today
Iris Chang	Well thanks for having Kris Wu! But to be honest I don’t feel well about the title of this talk. Cuz we know how much Kris has been through with his mom. Kris just let go of the past, that’s what has made who he is today. Finally, first new album is coming on 11/2, this Friday. Cannot wait. Much love bae😘
THE LOGICAL NEGRO	I watched this video just to see if Vlad the impaler would bring up some old beef that happened years ago and try to reignite it like he does with Black people and of course he didn't
tamara sky	I'm glad he learned English and changed his whole persona for himself
Rubisita Saori	Te amo Kris Wu😍
Glitchy Glitchy	Why get on the interviewer's case for asking questions? He's not a child who needs to be coddled and avoid topics about his past at all costs. He wouldn't have agreed to the interview if he was really that uncomfortable talking about these things. Past experiences make a man who he is today.
crystalrose	Thanks for asking about exo... maybe I can finally have some closure😞
j w	Omg quit the Dad questions okayyy? Stop digging that past that he doesn’t want to talk abt 😢
KateK	I've been his fan since he was in Korea. Most of the fans know he is from a single parent family,  no uses to ask that. I dont see how it would help to promote the upcoming album..... I can tell that he was a bit uncomfortable.
Rio Santos	wow thanks for this! wish the interview lasted longer - been wanting to see him opening up on his personal side. looking forward for more interviews on kris! really love this guy, amazing talent 😊✌🏻🤟🏻
Yutaka Namikawa	Am I the only who noticed Kris still feels uncomfortablle when he talks about exo?
BigBabyJesus	Wu?
Forgi Wrist	Damn Harold Gloed Up where kumar at tho ?
Emily KS	This interview is kind of awkward. You can tell from his face and reaction that he isn't quite comfortable with the conversation. The interviewer is asking questions that he doesn't really have the right to know.
Dorothy Ababon	Kris Wu is really cute rn😻
Charlie Wingate	Please don’t make interviewing these Japanese KPOP niggas a thing 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ Fucc Em 🖕🏾
Dzuthovolu Nienu	This made my day!!!❤️ Just so proud of him!
Hannia Gonzalez	Ily Kris ❤️
Puteri Balqis Azzawiyah	Can someone explain to me why I am crying when the interviewer says 'EXO' to Kris?
Ron McDon	i wish these people would make their own genre and stop jocking urban music. its annoying, couldnt find an urban center for the life of them but riding dick. i should open up a kung fu dojo.
Manjun Li	no hate  what i am trying to say is how u closed to be a pro basketball player when people score on U like eating chips 🤣🤣🤣
Trixia Dadia	The interviewer was so rude.  Why would you asked about his situation with his father?!  Dafuq!!
鹿安吉	his english is killing meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
Thandar Bo	The interview question about his dad is too personal. But we get to see how strong and talented our Fan Fan was thru the years.   Jia You Fan Fan. We're so proud of you for everything. You will always be part of this universe because you're the galaxy. ❤❤
Hannah Saldaña	Yeah Kris Wu yeahhh ❤
Elisabetta Cancrini	I dislike all those questions about his father. I found it disrespectful, honestly. Questions about his past in Korea would've been awkward enough, but still bearable, but this? It's really not okay. Anyway... everyone please anticipate Kris Wu's new album Antares out on November 2. ✌
Its Tina	Can't wait for the album.. I waited for 4 years I'm so happy 😍😍😍
skwlgl	*so what happen to your dad?* Omg i would stop questioning about his godamn dad after i heard *divorced* Its not being asian or western its about being respectful and common sense. Kris wu deserve better than this
Yunan Dinta	I wish Exo or Exo cbx could collaborate together with kris someday😂
exols 9	😑😑😑😑Thanks for this interview there are many points I want to ask u about it : he is sensitive against Exo and his father why can  U all stop asking him for many times why??
Charlene Ocampo	Why'd you have to pursue his family situation, what's that got to do with anything? The moment he said "divorced" you should've just stepped back and moved on??
Chuyền Hải	Kris you want to have your own solo career, i can understand. but you should have chosen the right time to left EXO , at that time, everything was very sensitive, all the members were  very upset, they felt like being , you left the group without saying anything. do you remember how worse at that time. then after your left, Tao and Luhan left, Lay is the only China member in the group. how many suffers has he been through, do you know? Lay said " please don't hate me'' when he came back to China for solo debut. everything was very bad . do you know your left take how much of our tears?, do you know you hurt our hearts , both EXO and EXO-L.  However, time can erase everything, we have become better. hope your career going well. but EXO-L never forget how hurt you brought to them.  #toKrisWu
Mandy Li	This host asked way too many questions on Kris’s personal life. You could tell he didn’t feel comfortable. It would of been really hard to express as well. The main focus should have been on his upcoming album. I find it extremely rude and disrespectful...
EXSOW	Yung mukha ni kris hindi maipinta nung binaggit yung exo
ดาว วิ้งวิ้ง	มีคนไทยดูมั้ย โครตซึ้งเนอะ เราไม่คิดว่าexoมี9คนหรอก เพราะเราคิดมาตลอดว่าexoมี12คน
Linda To	I really can't wait anymore for his new album releasing on 11.2
CraetonDaDonBeats	I wanna work with him
durga raja	Kris Iam really happy that you were able to do independent music...enjoy doing your work we will always support you
Oshi Byun	This man just made me cried so muchhhhh i misss hiiiim 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
خبولةةexo exo	mmmmmmmmmmy baby i really love him when i was ten years old  now im 18  and i love exo and luhan and tao
Alice Leed	I love you Kris... this interview gave me life
Tsinta Alfiyatin ni'mah	:(((
OWL 757	I love you Kris, so much exciting shout your album! Jiayo!
Trang Quỳnh	someone translate it into Vietnamese,please!!!
Mr. Jones	He should name his album "The Real WU story".
Awkward	To be honest if it weren’t for EXO I probably wouldn’t have supported kris at the start of his solo career, but damn I respect him so much for doing him and being true to himself. His music is bomb and he’s an amazing writer. We’re proud of you<3
Hazel Ampoloquio	Krrrrrriiiiiiis T_T
anisa guswara	I love you so much Kris Wu ❤❤❤ my galaxy fan fan💞
Christopher Chesler	Dude Looks like he could be from either the 1980s or somewhere in the 2080s
Sophia Charmaine	he deserve all the loves and happiness in the world. i feel emo.
EXO Is Lifeu!!!	Aaawwww Kris😭💔 our galaxy....,
IWAITISMYNATIONALATHEM	*if i got a penny for everytime he said yea i-*
Meg White	Is it just me or is this a really awkward and invasive interview..?
Master Nim	I hope you always happy kriss.. ❤
heechulliebabo	I see this is why he missed his mom so much. I also think he's really just better off being on his own given how independent he is and how much he was influenced by hip-hop. As an EXO-L, I'm glad he made it big on his own. :)
Amal A.	He's done so many hip-hop singles that made him look like a totally different Kris Wu Yi Fan but here he is in this video, sitting and talking and nodding and doing that thing with his eyes that I know he's still the same Kris. 😢 All the best, Kris! It's kind of cool that he and EXO are both releasing their albums on 2/11. What are Tao and Luhan doing that day lol
吴夫人	kris wu😍😍😍
Adrisha Affendi	We miss you so much Kris. You were one of the best leaders in EXO and we will never forget you! We will always support you! Can’t wait for your new album!!!!
Kris wu Blank reaction	Guess I'll change my username again
Adelline Santos	I love you Mr Galaxy that's all.. 💚
Yuti	The excessive digging on his relationship with his father was unnecessary and uncomfortable. Proud of Kris for handling it well. :) I hope speaking about Exo was comfortable for him. Wish ot12 would meet, sort it all out and be friends again.
lai wa Ip	He contains about 43millions of fans on Weibo, that’s why he would come back China to start his solo career, as here is his home. Anyway, EVERYONE is waiting his first album ‘Antares’ on Nov2. You should probably pre-order it, it won’t make u disappointed!!
Baek The Puppy 'ᄉ'	He's an independent artist now they should stop asking him about the past.  I mean I know they ask about the past but they should not invade this much(about the father) he's certainly comfortable.
diares em	proud dad here
Putri Casanova	❤
Ccl Galaxy	KirsWu👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lin Sun	Kris, super talented and passionate, super cool and nice. Deserves much love. Love your music, full of a kind of special, unique yet very positive energy. Your effort on music and new album will be seen soon. Can't wait for album Antares.
Nini Wu	Kris Wu🔥🔥🔥
Kkaebsong Chogiwa_6104	My man...his so strong to show that his ok but still I love him since he debuted with exo.
love 1106	Looking forward to ANTARES , the upcoming album.
kris liu	I love his new song called COUPE.
unbekanntes etwas	KRIS WU TAKE ALL MY LOVE
Andrew Lee	I guess it’s good at least since this is a interview in the west, they are able to talk about things he wouldn’t talk about in Asia. Same as for jay park talking about 2pm. Exo China members don’t talk about exo at all
Dinda ayu	12 members actually omg kris 😭😭😭
张艺兴YIXINGBAOBEI	Aaaaaa, k hiểu gì hết ý, 凡啊，我不認識這個外語
Jswift255	Vlad asks personal questions all the time in his vids. Why all these kpop fans so sensitive?
Red VelBaek	It's already 2018 and people are still asking him the same questions over and over again. It's getting really annoying to the point that I could actually feel his discomfort. 😞   Anyway good luck to your new album Galaxy boy! ❤
