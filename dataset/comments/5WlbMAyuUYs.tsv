Skip Acuff	Kƒìvens has applied his gift to the question whether Blue Wave voters are patriots.  I submit that Kƒìvens‚Äô video, music, and lyrics says YES!  It‚Äôs a shot in the arm for you, and a head exploder to every soul and spirit who has been irredeemably lost to Trumpism and its enablers and allies here and abroad.  For those who ask, ‚Äúirredeemably lost‚Äù = those who still identify their personal interests with Trump and the GOP, despite (or because of) the events and disclosures of the Kavanaugh nomination hearings led by the oldest hardline misogynists outside of Saudi Arabia, Trump‚Äôs relentlessly cruel persecution of folks seeking asylum from unspeakable horrors in their native lands, the Khashoggi murder and Trump‚Äôs handling of the aftermath, and the GOP‚Äôs unprecedented, still ongoing avalanche of lie-soaked propaganda during the campaign for the November 6, 2018 midterm elections.   Friends, unless we prevail and preserve the patriotism depicted in Kƒìvens video, America will for the foreseeable future lose its pre-Trump reputation, still not fully earned, as the land of the free, home of the brave, of truth, justice, and the American Dream. The WH‚Äôs recent statement that the Saudis‚Äô version of the Khashoggi murder, i.e., that he brought fists to a bone saw fight, is credible, has earned us the contempt of rational, democracy-minded people throughout the world.  Let‚Äôs show the world that the Trump fiasco is a fluke, that we‚Äôre so much better than that, and that the majority of us want preserve the uniquely American aspirations displayed in Kƒìvens‚Äô song and poignant imagery.  PLEASE send ‚ÄúSweet Lady Liberty‚Äù to everyone in your social network and urge them to do the same ad infinitum. Believe a veteran protester of the Viet Nam war during the late 60s and early 70s, protest music does reach and motivate people to act. This, too, is part of our American heritage.

Shelli RK	This! This is the America I love. We've gone down a dark path and we need our great hearted, loving brothers and sisters who understand the values that bring neighbors and strangers together to be better people to vote! We may not always see who will be best to lead us, but when we glaringly see who is definitely wrong for us, we have to take action to keep them out of Office. Red and blue alike!
