Then on the other hand ted cruz is pro israel which is the nation pushing for open borders everywhere except for israel. I'm all for america first. No foreign aid to anyone we're in debt right? Also, why can't we boycott israeli companies? Why would abbot even sign that into law?! Who cares if I don't want to purchase from israel? Should I only be allowed to buy nike now? I'm still waiting for this wall. Why does Israel get a wall and we can't? Also, waiting for all the treasonous government employees to be hung on live tv. I don't think these people even care about america.
