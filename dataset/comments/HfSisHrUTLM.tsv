IrwansS Sseptiawan	baru kemarin saya nonton 2 film besutan XYZ film . pertama Mandy ( Nicolas Cage ) dan yg kedua ini ..  Xyz film dari dulu memang terkenal dengan film action berdarah-darah seperri killer dll. mandy darah nya banyak tapi tak sefrontal film ini  . mandy menyuguhkan kekejaman yg tak dinampakan adegannya . difilm ini kita disuguhkan perkelahian ala The Raid ., hingga banyak yg bilang ini Film The Raid yg ke-3 ., padahal bukan , catat ya *bukan* ! . film ini sama hal nya dengan Headshoot , antagonisnya pun sama  , yg membuat saya Terperangah justru bukan perkelahian antara Iko dan Joe , melainkan Pemain nya Seperti *Dian sastro* , *Dimas Anggara* , *Abimana* , bahkan *Morgan Oey* mereka terkenal dengan Drama namun kali ini bermain di Genre yg baru bagi pengalamannya .  So Cool keren ,. 7,7 Fresh Movie .
fikri ardonugroho	clasicc crime stroy but good
Dunia Jenaka	Ada bloopers yang sangat mengganggu di awal. Waktu Joe Taslim di kamar mandi dan diperban sama cewek. Ada yg gak berurutan. Pertama sicewek masang perban ke perutnya. Pas Joe menghadap cewek perbannya ilang. Lalu scene selanjutnya perbannya ada. Hahahha kelihatan banget miss nya.  Trus pas iko naik mobil di tol. Suasananya malam.. saat mobil disuruh minggir udah pagi aja.   Bener bener banyak gak sequence gambarnya.
Sukoco iGede	the fight so real, terrific but cool
Emily Weirdnez	Love it. You guys did it again!
Sadd Block	Overated af but its still fun movie tho

Fheby Wahyu	Fak! 😱 nyeri bgt anjy liat scan iko fight sma joe di final
dakko chan	this is the most brutal action movie i've ever seen so far.
Septino Andarswesa	The song Murderer - Low, which was played during the last scene in "The Night Comes for Us." so hit. Actually, the meaning of the lyrics is ironic. The point is to explain that we commit murder in the name of God. A kind of justification for how evil we are. The point is fit to this film, killing each other without feeling guilty, even to kill criminals brutally.
RckerMom87	So I thought Mission Impossible: Fallout was the best action film or the year but wrong this was 10x better. The fight choreography was fucking brutal. Sad some of my fellow Americans won't watch due to subs like my mom lol.
Josue Konan	putain de merde je kiff grave ce film c'est du bon jadore

jayon101	This trailer doesn't even do the movie justice this movie is crazy as F#$k I was like holy sh#t the whole time😱
Frei Francheise	why iko uwais always play as villain?? well i have no doubt love he playing as villain thought.
TRUTH ABSOLUTE	Did anyone else notice the subtle spiritual undertones of this movie? The messages concerning Redemption? The messages about sometimes still having to pay a price for the mistakes you've made in this life? Like the 2 thieves who were on the crosses with Christ. One of them was basically repenting and acknowledging Christ while the other stayed hateful and spiteful. The one was doomed for the eternity, but the other was only physically doomed in the temporary for the mistakes he made. In the movie you can see a glowing cross outside of the apartment. And a bit later the unrepentant and hateful female enemy turns the cross upside down on the wall.  I really liked these subtle touches.
Bratislav Metulski	REALLY BAD TRAILER . . . looks like The Villainess meets The Raid 2.. But I heard its the most brutal movie since years. after the first 20 minuten there is nonstop-splatter-heroic-bloodshed-martial-arts. is that true? I dont like brutality just for the brutality in the raid 2 - raid 1 was fun, but 2 sucks in all ways!
Taufan Andika	When I see this film -_- => ( 0.0 )
Ben Ten 10	Harus ada yg kedua sih parah👏

Fii Saf	2 hours full of action
Cellar Door	That was some high calibre ass fighting scenes. Exhilarating tbh. The chick fighting off the lesbian villains was my personal favourite.
Dont Dream	pleaseeee show this film in theaters :"
Alison Dorvis	So sad to heard that Gareth Evans wont do The Raid 3 anymore...  I wish that Timo Tjahjanto could take over it (with the story is still written by Gareth)
Bosenaja	Iko Uwasi is the best Pencak Silat fighter! Cant wait to see him and Gareth Evans make another epic movie again..

woodchuckcider1	This film is blood, brains, bullets, body parts, guts torn out, limbs hacked off, sliced off heads, smashed heads, crushed heads, throat slashing, broken bones, protruding bones, death everywhere.
Molexer	Wow. Amazingly brutal movie and I highly recommend, just don't watch it in the morning to start your day.

Zlatan9	that girl fight and final fight is epic...👏
Anderson Damião	Very good movie
De Chan	Joe & Iko Uwais Vs Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Statham, Jet Li Who's the winner???
AncientXer	OMFG this movie is amazing! 10/10! I've been a fan of Iko since the first Raid. He and Taslim are simply fantastic in what is easily one of the most violent martial-arts movies in a long time. Even      more violent then the Raid 2. Hammer Girl is back! Everything about this movie is exceptional. Watch it!
Horus Fiend	Iko Uwais 1st fight https://youtu.be/7-v_yh9Mvbk
Djoc alfian	Film yg bikin nagih, selalu aku putar ulang terus scene action nya guis, mantabzzz, full blood or first blood 😎

Faizal Rachman	I N D O P R I D E 👏
Hegemon59	I sense the next installment might be Iko & Tony Jaa playing together hunting down southeast asia's smugglers or something!
Mastagambit	Quite possibly the best action movie ever made.
Ada Ghost	Once again Indonesians show us how to edit fight scenes... Not hollywood garbages with  dozens of cuts, where we see nothing like in "Jason Bourne", "Transformer"...  STOP THE CUTS, and show us the fight...  One of the best action movie ever!
INKA	killers and headshot was made by the same guy? headshot was so bad though?!
Dorita Gichlik	quiero en español por favor,que hay???????
MegaLaidback	Crazy mad fights.
UnbelievabIeMontages	this movie is dogshit compared to the raid
Samudra Samudra	This movie is not about "martial art fighting" like The Raid movie. Its a gore movie, flesh and brain everywhere.
Maan Bustamante	i just finished watching this movie, and my God this is beyond thrilling and brutal!! i don't want to be bias and all but I've seen a lot of action movies with really good fighting scenes so i really can't decide which is better than the other, but one thing is for sure this will surely keep you on the edge of your seat in the entire run of the movie. in fact, my hands and feet were cold the entire time! armpits even! hahahahaha! if you guys enjoyed The Raid: Redemption, The Raid 2, Headshot, and SPL Kill Zone Trilogy; you have to watch this. highly recommended especially for those martial arts fans :)
HomeIsWhereTheHeartIs	I need to see this asap 😍😍😎
Dylan Kane	Dude the fight scenes in this movie were INCREDIBLE.
orang pdowae	Film best from indonesia iko best  actor.. pokoknya aktor 2 indonesia the best lo..
erriwibowo	I hope Netflix can finance other Indonesian stories, from real story like the Woyla plane hijack, silent war,  indpendence war, until the superhero dc like universe (yeah we have that).... If you make this movie in US may cost hundred million dollars, but in Indonesia maybe only cost 4 or 5 million dollars.. I believe we can make a grand war movie with that budget. The world can get a new kind of movies...
BuzzyTony	THE best action movie with The Raid 1 & 2 !!! Must see
Dhana Ciem	Kampret lama kali...... kirain besok udah tayanh
Mr Case	I love it man! Iko are Silat fighter and Joe are Judo fighter and they became rivals in this movie!

zayn malik	bangga!
Neng Mua	Wow!!! I’m still literally catching my breath!!!  This movie literally puts every Hollywood and Chinese blockbuster action movie to shame. I’ve never seen anything like it.  I think it’s even better than “The Raid” and we all know that there is nothing better than “The Raid”.  It’s a shame that I could not get to enjoy this movie on the big screen at the theater.
Ai Husairi	I want Joe Taslim to be Namor on MCU.
Rere Bennoda	Joe & Iko comes from Netflix!!!!!!

FIQI PUTRA ZENDA	this move has listed in imdb top 100 action movie of all time    https://www.imdb.com/list/ls027328830/
Aswin A	Too much blood, too much stabbing, just non-stop fighting, and no interesting storyline or characters are who are too cliché... The Raids are alright but this is too Raid-wannabee.
kiki syamsudin	Julie estelle  GOOOOOOODESSSSSS....PLEASE MAKE HER SOLO MOVIE, SINCE HAMMER GIRL SHE IS MY FAV BADASSS...PLEASE PLEASE MAKE HER SOLO BADASS MOVIE....😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

Scar face	Excellent movie
aulia yanna	I'm happy when I see iko uwais being a boss!
majed8192	A very good movie indeed and the fighting sequences were so so good I'm gonna take a risk here and say that they may be the best ever created to date amazingly complicated moves and environment usage that doesn't shy away from excessive gore made them such a marvel to look at especially the sniper girl vs the lesbians and indeed the Iko vs Joe those were the most remarkable though each fighting scene was a joy to watch :)
N. A	After a long time, a decent action movie. Hollywood use to be the best, now it's a joke.
eΔe se†	I think this masterpiece would be still in the next years my favourite movie with the raid 2

WNo Alone	film ini adalah standar baru sebuah film action, bahkan hollywood harus menjadikan sebagai acuan bagaimana membuat film action yg benar benar "fullpower"

Alex	This film was something else... best action I've seen in years. Can't even imagine how some of the scenes were put together.
ronald bastian	Well, we have the cast from the raid series, like iko uwais, joe taslim, and julie estelle
D & D Creation	gak pengen comment tapi gak tahan Film ini bisa dibilang "Cukup Buruk"  - entah kenapa dari The Raid 1 Film yg diperankan Iko dan Joe ini alur ceritanya terlalu abstrak, latar belakang cerita tidak jelas (tapi ingat ! bukan berarti saya tidak paham) - film yang diperankan mereka terlalu mengedepankan sadisme, darah dimana mana  - scene action "adu jotos" sungguh buruk, terlalu banyak lawan yg diem dibelakang entah menunggu apa, belum lagi gimmick mau berkelahi kebanyakan (tatap tatapan, gaya sok tengil/jagoan} - acting Dian Sastro, Hannah "ampas banget" - Sunny Pang (gak ada yang laen ?}  + Iko Uwais, Zack Lee, Joe Taslim (akting dan cara berkelahi) terbilang bagus, terutama buat Zack (Sangar Anda Alamiah)   ++++++++ 4 JEMPOL buat Julie Estelle (akting, perawakan, gaya berkelahi, cara menembak) TOP MARKOTOP + MACAN "Manis Cantik"

Steve-o 316	Just finished watching it and this movie is fuckin awesome. Definitely in my top action movies of 2018. I would've watched this in theaters it's that good. Even the women fighters are bad ass. Hannah Al Rasheed 😍 had me both frightened and aroused lol. The action scenes are fast, furious, and gory as hell.  So I give The Night Comes For Us 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 out of 5
levian	WHAT THE FUCK I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS

Pasha Rahmadina	This will be epic
Victor Galvão	This movie is simply amazing. Hollywood one day will learn how make action movies. It is not like there is no examples out there for them to rely on. The raid 1 and 2, headahot and now this. 4 movies. Cmon Hollywood you just gotta copy the style.
TafTabTah	Fucking good!

Lilly Rose	AMAZING movie. Please watch
Fernanda wahdani	Kampret yg komen kagak ada yg pakai bahasa indo :):)
oditya nico	netflix kapan akur sama telkom?? yg pakai indihome ma telkomsel cm gigit jari
Akbar Sujatmiko	I love this film, I'd give it 9/10 out of the action scenes alone. In fact, I enjoyed it more than The Raid films, which I gave 8,5/10 each. The action choreography never once feels repetitive, which otherwise is my problem for The Raid 1 & 2. The blood/gore, creativity, and many interesting characters saves the film for me. As for the story, who needs a good plot when they saw these kind of film? Altho, I agree they should expand it 5-10 minutes more to deepen the story or some characterizations
Ryan lex	Lame
Rhinowcksn	better than netflix the punisher or marvel netfilx tv series it self
Rizki Yantria	Finally the Raid 3 coming

F2	lokasinya sama.... 🙃
ZUGA ZUGA	keep your child too brutal for them to see and not good for foodies because something you have eaten will be spewed out by a pool of blood and the sound of crushed bones. just a warning to empty your stomach before you enter the cinema. good work for directors and teams because of full brutal fighting scenes without CGI touches and beautiful camera shoots when actors act
bobby connett	This shit was so good...I dont have the words. And it's easily the most violent netflix film they have ever released. 👏👏👏👏👏 it was incredible! 10 out of 10 no debate
IHate TrashTalk	Fatih and white boy bobby is the best But so sad they Both die fighting a lot of triad They kill almost 60 plus triad ... They old crew has the best Fighter but they Lose each other ... So its bad movie
VAPORIZM	ITO BANGSAT!!!! SADIS BANGET INI FILM!!! LOL 🤣
Iqball ccc	kapan rilis di yt pak?
András Csabai	God bless Indonesia for this movie. Sometimes you need this kind of crazy shit. Loved the point-blank shotgun scene :D Needless to say, we want MORE. I'm sad that there won't be a third part for Raid, but i'm so glad that this movie exists. :D
dan86896	what is this crap and ther voices did they never grow up and got stuck whit helium voice
The Geeky Amreeki	Fun fact you can make trailers without Inception Bwaaaaaaaahs or sad cover versions of popular songs...
Daniel Negoiță	Way too much. I mean final battle it s a joke tooooo much. I mean c mon the guy cuts his trouth and still stands. C monnnn i know it s just a movie but it s a waste of time. Storyline is bullshit
Ryan La Ode	DIAN SASTRO OMYGOD
Sayak roy-choudhury	If you watch this movie you will FEEL the pain . 5/5 This movie is like the director asked everyone "what's the most painful moment you ever encountered" and put all of it in the movie. Not just stabs and GSW , small things like pins in your hand. A must watch man.

Ahmad Marwan Zainol	As expected so much talent in indonesian filming industry that bring Netflix finally to produce the film despite one of the strategy to enlarge customer base of emerging digital market in South East Asia.
Deep Dimensions	Kon kon chutiye netflix subscribe kar chuke hai luwdo torrent aur poppcorn app nahi sune the kya🤣🤣
World Wanderer Boxing Channel Subscribe	This film is epic & redefines fight choreography! Makes the Raid look like Paddington Bear. Pretty generic story but we'll acted & the action & realism have to be seen to be believed. 99% out of a 100!!

Anderu Uredna	Well this is what we call a snack time 😀 before the raid 3: Dead of berandal was release 😎
Fuad Rahman	cara nonton netflix gimana ya? di bioskop kah?
Oen Laksono	Ini movie semi EDAN. A non recommended  movie for the soft-hearted person (I guess), but a collectible item and mandatory to watch for action movie junkies :)
stryfetc1	Iko is my favorite action star now....after I watched those Raid movies....too bad the 3rd one was scrapped!
Ngeluyur BarengISTRI	Keren ya,,
Adam Thalib	Sudah liat.. bagus sih untuk pengarapan nya.. tapi kurang suka.. terlalu sadis.. sepanjang film isi nya pembacokan dengan detail pengorokan nya..  menurut saya ini film kesadisan nya melebihin batas..

Wan Nasir Ahmad	crazy fight ever. wtf brutal!!
Fahad Abdullah	O my god.holy shit.😍😮😮😮😮😮
Tony Richengod	This movie was so outrageously violent that at one point becomes comical. I LOVED The Raid (10/10), it's my favorite action movie, but I feel they're going too far with the shock factor in place of substance. Don't get me wrong, the violence is VERY WELL DONE, but at this point it's almost like violence itself is the star of the movie instead of an instrument for telling a good story. 7/10
Mad Scientist	Dan ternyata Netflix diBlokir, WTF.       turn on VPN
studswat87	I really hope The Operator will have her own movie...and have her pinky reattached.

Soearadiri Movie	Forget the motherfucker Garreth Evans... we already got The Raid 3
watdaification	Gareth Evans paved the way for proper martial arts action movies in the 2010’s and now the trend he set finally has a platform large enough to spread the awesomeness even more. Sadly hollywood can never replicate this style pf choreography for their action movies since guys like Iko are martial artists first and actors second. I mean keanu is good but not on this level. The only guy that can come close would be the guy who played boyka but sadly hollywood doesn’t know how to use his talents properly.

Your God Wilfred	Headshot was a great movie, not the same level of craftmanship as the Raid in the fight scenes but that's a high fucking bar to be honest-  What a time to be a movie nerd, you see a trailer of a movie you have no idea iscoming out, and to be able to see it one week later, in your house, fucking insane.
