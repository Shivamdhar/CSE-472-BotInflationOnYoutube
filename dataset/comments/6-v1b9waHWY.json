The main aspect of meditation is, right now your mind is the boss and you are the slave. As you meditate and become more meditative, you will become the boss and your mind will become the slave and that is how it should always be. If you don’t know how to keep the mind as a slave, it will put you through all kinds of endless suffering. If you allow the mind to rule, it is a terrible master.

Now, we are looking at the technology of keeping these three bodies constantly aligned so that joyfulness is not an accidental happening; joyfulness becomes a normal condition, a natural way of living for you.”\n For more kindly see Isha Yoga-Shambavi mahamudra.\nas it is all that one needs, a human has to do requires to fulfill all every aspect of itself & life and live a complete life\n🌞Thank you very much for reading 💕 Ravi bedia Isha yoga foundation.

But music was really fun back then. Beautiful and so heartfelt. I guess they're is a few new music that's like that. But rarely. Now its a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Gold, sex, drugs, women, etc. They was the same back then but at least you could appreciate the beat the words. And the way how they said it.. but 90s 2000s forever missed along with that old slow computer that used to piss us off. Nd have to download the music to hear it. AOL messages. Pin ball, centipede, the movie blade, resident evil, when wwe was wwf. or the show's rugrats. Wildthorn berries, power rangers, the Amanda show, all that, drake and josh, cat dog, angry beaver's. Cow and chicken, hey Arnold. Beavis and butt head, celebrity death match, Jack ass, MTV. When they had real music. Teen titans. The first episode of pokemon. Original old dragon ball z. Gundam, invader zim, Billy and mandy. when Nintendo 64 and super Nintendo was popular well it was for me,  we still played it, went outside and played with rolly pollies, skipped rocks, rode scooter's, the birth of slim shady, that movie the gremlins, back to the future, the memories of parties, and family coming over, when my grandma and gramps was still alive and dancing.

Vs the Music Fests today? Nahh you can\'t beat Woodstock! \n The simplicity of 90s yet its so amazing. And also the evolution of technology, We, in 30\'s out there has the best experience of how everything has evolved, we\'ve seen the raw times and the modern day. We have existed in between of era  before and era of today, we experienced both sides and is still young! 😂 \nI can still remember when we were using DOS for our personal computers, cassettes when listening to Alanis Morisette, when our cellphones were Nokia 5110, Alcatel or Bosch and we felt so amazing having those phones because we were the first ones who used the "texting" technology for the first time ever.  Haha it was so awesome, the greastest era of all time is 90s. When we were watching " ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK" TV Series every night, and oh, BAYWATCH too!, Our favorite Wonder Years! And Doogie Howser M.D.!😂. You watch RIVERDALE? Horsesht! We watch Dawson\'s Creek!  And American Pie our all time movie as a kid 😎\nWhen We go to house parties interacting with people without any social media and sht, man! that was so raw!.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus\'s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.". \n\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don\'t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you\'re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it\'s because Satan doesn\'t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it\'s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It\'s everlasting torture with no relief. I\'m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.', 'Emilia Krzyżańska': 'The sims!!', 'Aderinsola Adesida': "Between this and Anne Marie's 2002, isn't it funny how we have started singing about how good it was back then?\nWe are growing old fam😅", 'Dillan Cr': 'go check this song out, let me know what you think? https://youtu.be/df00xRkEeYo', 'nika': 'skinny legends', 'Alejandro Migule Guerrero Mejia': '😍', 'kirby 64': 'damn. i was born in 1999 and i still get these references. \ni think it shows just how much of an impact 90s culture had. \ni always joke that the 90s didnt truly end until 2005.', 'What’s your favorite Dinner food': 'Omg the movies she added and stuff', 'alyssa puth': 'TROYE LOOKS SO GOOD', 'Rock amolie': 'I have no idea who these people are but  this song is a Bop!!
